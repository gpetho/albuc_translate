It seems that you have completed this book, which is the beginning of medical science, for the benefit of those who follow in his footsteps, and for the exposings of his works, and for the declarations of his works, I believe that you have comprehensively covered this for you in this treatise, which is part of the operation called surgery.
The first source sentence translates to: "However, the operation was performed in our region and at our time, as we value science above all else, and the description of it remains; and we do not regret it except for some minor descriptions in the ancient books, which have been closed due to errors and misunderstandings that arise when the sense of the text is misunderstood and the force of the argument is stretched.
It is my belief that you live in the order of this treatise's second part, which is about the exposure and declaration and abbreviation; and for the reason that the forms of the cautery tools and other instruments of the work are added to the declaration, and for the preparation of it, which is necessary.
The reason why the artisan is not able to make the art in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and that the actor is not exercised in the science of anatomy which Guala knew when he saw the advantages of the members and the forms of them, and the connection and separation of them; and had knowledge of the bones, nerves, and ligaments, and the number of them, and their characteristics; and of the pulsating veins and quiet ones, and of the loci of the empysema of them.
For this is Isaac, who is called by a name, and it is smaller in the work but greater in the art of medicine.
We have already spoken of this in the introduction of this book; however, it is not known what was said about anatomy, nor is it clear that it does not cause errors in the science, as you have seen many of those, who are formed in this science and get their knowledge from that science and its experiments.
You saw a doctor and experienced an incision on the thigh of a woman, and the doctor also incised some arteries in the thigh so that great blood flowed into the woman's dead leg between the many of him.
And you saw another doctor who thought that the man was dying from a stone in his bladder, and the stone was large, and it came out of the bladder through the urethra, so that the man died on the third day.
And you already called for help and saw that the large stone and the position of the thigh under the woman caused her to die.
When a doctor from another country took payment from a duke of our land for surgery, and went to a blacksmith who was known for his skill in mending broken bones in the thigh; and the doctor, being ignorant of the procedure, cleaned the fracture with a hammer and chisel over the plasma, with pulleys and ropes for strong traction, and did not leave any spillage in the plasma.
And follow the doctor's instructions, and the relief, and the lessons for the next few days and command that we unwrap the limb; and it is clear that the thigh and foot are in pain, and it comes to loss.
And you called him and appeared to unwrap the limb, and obtained peace and ease from those pains.
However, the corruption was already confirmed in the member, so it could not stop that, and did not cease to wander the corruption in the member after the operation for the reason that the thigh was pernicious.
I saw another doctor who performed an amputation for cancer and it ulcerated after a few days, because the malice of the lord was revealed by the magnificent focus.
This cause is what we call the cramp of the gout, which is caused by melancholic humor, and it does not come from outside, but rather from within the member that you suffer from, which has been harmed in all parts.
Therefore, dear children, it is necessary for you to have the operation made in two parts: one part is done in the operation associated with health, and the other is done in the larger dispositions.
And you have already existed there in all places of this free in which the operation has been made in which error and fear; because it is necessary for you to guard that and lay it down, so that the folk does not fall into speaking and being dishonest with you.
And then, arm yourselves with your anxiety and protection from God, and your wounds with their closure and firmness.
And use the best way through the grace of God to be saved and praised in this succession, and lay down the terrible wounds of difficult cure, and keep your arms with that which you fear, so that you may be judged in your faith and name: for what remains is for your glory, and push on in the world and beyond your sanctities.
The first line of the text is not in a language similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, or French. It seems to be a word or phrase that does not fit with This line can be translated as: "Do not treat the sick lightly, because bad humors do not respond to treatment.
When you have already opened this page three times, it means that you have read it three times before. This is a statement about the number of times the text has been read, not a medical diagnosis or treatment recommendation
The division of this book begins, and the first part of this section follows. This is a statement about the structure of the text, not a medical diagnosis or treatment recommendation. The first chapter ordered from the head to the foot, in the forms of the instruments and in the burnings of the cautery, and for that reason necessary in the operation. This is a statement about the purpose and content of the first chapter, not a medical diagnosis or treatment recommendation.
The division of the second part. This is a statement about the structure of the text, not a medical diagnosis or treatment recommendation The second chapter, of dryness and perforation, and of winds, and of plagues, and of the extraction of sores and of similitudes to those, all of them divided into the forms of the instruments. This is a statement about the content and structure of the second chapter, not a medical diagnosis or treatment recommendation.
The third chapter, of restoration and displacement, and of the cure of twists and similitudes to those; divided into the forms of the instruments from the head to the foot. This is a statement about the content and structure of the third chapter, not a medical diagnosis or treatment recommendation.
I ask about the quality of the cauterizing instruments and the tools for puncturing, and in what collection it is forbidden to use cauterization.
Therefore, I say that the discourse on the quality of cauterizing instruments and puncturing tools is long and prolix, subtle in knowledge, and secret; and many wise men have spoken about it, and they are in disagreement, and for me a little of their words is enough to fear prolongation.
And therefore, I say that cauterization comforts the entire composite matter universally, except for two collections, which are the maters of those collections.
In the dry and dehydrated collection, the matter will be destroyed; four said that cauterization is beneficial for that, and the others said the opposite of that, that cauterization is not suitable in bad quality, which is due to its quality and dryness, and nature of the fire is also affected by this, and it is not convenient that bad quality and dryness be cautious and dry before being healed.
When you ask someone to tell the opposite of what I say, it is believed that using cauterization is beneficial in the entire tail of the female genitalia and drying that appears in the chests of men, as when you compare the chest of a man with the humidity of his body to the collection of fire, it harms the chest of a man.
When I speak about this matter, I have already seen it happen in my own practice many times.
However, I do not know what to expect from that which has been practiced in the capital of cauterization for exercise, and is known of the diversity of the people and the disposition of their diseases in their bodies, and the causes of those, and the accidents that happen to them, and the passage of time for those.
In other cases, it is not about your fear, and especially in wet and humid diseases, where all doctors are agreed on this, and there is no disagreement in the practice of cauterization at that time.
However, you should know, children, that the secret of healing by cauterization is in the fire and the good of it, and cauterization is a part of medicine, which is simple, the effect of which does not reach the other member except the one that is cauterized and does not affect the other member unless it is adjusted to a small amount.
However, the effect of burning medicine reaches the members that are not ill, and it comes to the member with difficult cure very little, and it is heard very little.
When the fire is hot, due to its sublimity and good substance, it does not cause harm unless it is superfluous. And we have learned by experiment and through long service in the study of the art of the truth of causes; and therefore I am excused for the length of this discourse and if not, it would not be relevant to my free time in this pause from your secret desire for the fire, and the quality of the operation of the heart and the expulsion of the waste through which you expel the diseases, which is demonstrated in philosophical discourse, which sharpens in your minds.
Indeed, sons, that when it is most convenient to make a cautery, one should pause the best time of day.
And you say that cauterization is convenient in all times, because the harm from the time accident is submerged in the youthfulness of the one who has the cauterization, and especially if the cauterization is for pains or necessary pains, do it, those which do not suffer delay due to those that are feared as those that will come from maliciousness, which is greater than small harm entering through time.
When you do not have needles in your thighs, or, children, you do not esteem it but only the common people and the village cunning ones, so that at that disease which is cured by cauterization, it is not always effective, and they pause that consequence.
The cause is not that they are cut for that, but rather because cauterization is not in its place as a medicine which alters the complexion and dries out the humors which are the cause of the pain.
However, cauterization is sought over medicine for its own merits and virtues of its operation and the greatness of the Lord's servant.
It is possible that the disease returns at some time, according to the complexion of the disease and its location in the disease, and the virtue of the patient, and that it is prepared in the body of the patient by the addition of superfluities in the patient, and that it has reached the patient through travels and resemblances of those causes; but if the disease to which cauterization is administered is a subtle disease in a few superfluities and humors, then as with cauterization for toothache and resemblances of that, it is possible that the pain does not return in that place, more so if it is done in small amounts.
This is a common saying that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and it is called a "dreyturier" (which I assume is a misspelling or archaic term for "remedy" or "cure"), not because I understand what it means in this context, but because I believe it implies that one should not rely solely on cautery or medicine, but also on other causes or remedies.
However, the cause is in contradiction to this; and I understand that cautery is the last resort of medicine is not only when they administer the necessary remedies for certain diseases, and those medicines do not work, and at the end of the cause they maintain the patient with cauterization, and they rely on it. And I understand that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not second to what I understand from the common people and many of the folk doctors.
They would say that cautery is better than iron cauterization, and they did not say this except for the equality of gold and the superiority of its substance.
They would say that the location of cauterization does not burn, as it is not absolutely true, because you have said and I have seen that this does not work only in certain parts of the body, and cautery is better than iron when they said so; but if you do cauterization with gold, it is not declared by you, because it depends on the quantity you want for the hardness of gold, and you prepare the receptacle for the gold; and if you adjust over it the gold in the focus, and then in the focus some layers for the artifex to occupy that part.
In order for this to be considered cauterization, it is necessary to use a sharp iron and apply it lightly and firmly in the direction of the operation.
I have already ordered this capital in the cauterization according to the following capitals, and I have ordered those of the foot to enter between the feet, so that the patient can ask for this without difficulty.
The first capital.
This cauterization conceals the cold and wetness of the accident that caused it, which causes soreness and numerous rheumatic fluxes, called corissa, from the head to the parts of the eyebrows and eyelids, and numerous sleeping, and toothache and gout, and generally all maladies that occur due to cold, such as paralysis, stroke, and resemblance in those maladies.
The form of this cauterization is this, which first commands the patient to evacuate the head that has been cut by a scalpel, three or four times, according to what is required by the virtue of the head and the age of the patient and their custom.
And when it is necessary to shave that part of the body, and when you want to sit down on a low chair and place your hands on the chest you want.
And put the razor on pause, the point on the nose, between your thumb and index finger. However, as the said place has been said to be, try that place with the cautery, and if you do not have olive oil, this is the form:
And put it on that place, with your hand that descends, with the thumb that is slightly bent, and you rotate that.
And lift your hand gently and look at the place, and if you see already some part of the bone being discovered in any quantity of flesh, then as much as the quantity of pain, raise your hand again, and if not turn the iron, turn another one from that, if it is cold, enter that is seen of the bone that I have told you to you.
And take a small piece of salt and dissolve it on that place and spread it around for three days.
When you have paused over the firebox and placed your hand on the inside, make sure that part is not destroyed by the heat of the fire. And properly care for the area with a four-drug remedy if it is healthy.
When it was known that the Roman plague caused so much pain in the arm, then it was better and more effective to open it.
When the bones within the thigh are cauterized and held with a cautery, it is necessary to hold the cautery in place until the desired part of the bone is burned.
If the joint is affected by the bone and if it is curved.
They also did others with the cautery going through the thigh, entering where it presses on the bone firmly and causes it to crackle, and this is the form of an alphecati small: It is estimated that vapors from the head will escape from that place.
If the wound is held open for a long time and is cured when it is solidified.
I have not seen such special cases of cauterization as these, only in the fearful cases of other men; and if you want to improve your health, when you can; and especially when the head of the thigh is united by a solution of continuity of the flesh as has been testified in other members, and most importantly when the head of the thigh is of natural nature.
And the first type of cauterization is less safe and you should do better for your health; and from that habit and to that work is good for your health.
The text appears to be a medical treatise written in an ancient
form of Latin or a related language. Here's my best attempt at trans
When chronic and long-lasting pain occurs throughout the head, and it is prolonged in the temple area, and using gauze, needles, and other similar substances, and poultices and plasters and bandages and wraps and cloths, and especially if it has been cauterized with a cautery that does not inflame or cause pain at the same spot as the cause, then consider whether the temple of the head is of strong constitution in its nature; and do not ignore or neglect great friction, if the cauterization is done on another part of the body. If you are going to burn that part of the body, make sure to use an appropriate cauterizing instrument and avoid burning areas with sensitive skin or bones. The phrase "la codena es partida" is unclear, but it might refer to a specific anatomical structure or a condition. Cut the tendon and expose the bone to determine the amount of tissue that has been affected, and then burn that part with a cauterizing instrument in the area called the "V" spot, and place your hand on the side where there is airflow. The phrase "la qual es apelat vas" seems to be a mistake or an error in the text, as it does not make sense in English. And then close the wound and do not discover the bone, as the thigh will bleed greatly from this cauterization, which is different from the pain of other cauterizations on the head. The phrase "et no descobras le os" suggests that the bone was not visible or exposed during the procedure.
And tell this cauterization in that place, where you can say that this cauterization is the one that is used to cauterize the corners of the head and the occipital bone, with a subtle cauterization that is applied to the same location of the head; and this is the form of it. The phrase "le qual es cauterisat le mieg loc del cap" seems to be a mistake or an error in the text, as it does not make sense in English.
The given text appears to be a medieval medical treatise written
In the case of non-ancient gout, it is recommended to use a cautery to make points on the surface of the affected area. This method has
When the head is painful and there is pain in the throat, or if there is swelling in the neck, it is recommended to remove the affected part with a medical tool and administer the appropriate treatment, which I have mentioned in the previous sections. Then, do not forget to perform cauterization on the area using two methods: either with an acute medical cauterization tool or with a iron.
May cautery be used in medicine as it is that you take a hollowed-out piece of lead, and gently press the extremities of the affected limbs against the cold caps. Then mark the location of the pain in the temple with a lancet, entering it at the spot where the humor is located, and then entering it at the hidden spot.
And compress the area with a bandage, and leave it for three hours; and then take off the bandage, and apply the plaster over the skin for two or three days, and then rest over the submerged cotton dressing within the affected area.
And care for that wound as it becomes healthy.
And if you see, use some remedies that I have written about in the book of burning medicines.
May cautery be used as follows: iron for cauterization, and this is the form:
It is called a claw clamp, and the head of the iron is shaped like a thistle with a curve in it, and in the small location where it is inserted, it becomes smaller.
And place your hand over the painful spot, and tie it with your cloth so that the artery that is left does not burst, and roll the small piece back slowly.
If the amount of blood that is burst by the section of the spine is less than the capacity of the vein, and you tie it with your cloth so that the artery does not burst, so that there will be no flow of blood.
And apply a poultice of salt water and place it over the painful spot, and remove it after three days; and apply a poultice of wet cloth and care for it as it becomes healthy.
If you see, cauterize at the end of the umbilical cord according to cauterization, and keep an eye on the artery in this unusual place actually.
Chapter four.
Of ancient umbilical cord cauterization.
When you treat the ancient umbilical cord wound that has been said of the previous treatment, and what has been said in the divisions of the diseases, and do not profit from the treatment, and sometimes by the disease that does not suffice for what has been said in the first cauterization in medicine or in cauterization at the focus, you will then see that you carve the umbilical cord at the location of the pain, which is long and is the tail of the one that has been said, or that; and stop your hand for a moment and stretch it over the incision of the artery and presses it within the bone and passes through the artery and goes into the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuance of the jaw, which is harmed by chewing, and that the lizard not be pushed in and the nerves that cause that, and that it does not swell.
If it is about the custody and caution of the flow of sang from the artery that is opened, then in the opening of the same one fears, and particularly to that which ignores that he does and does not study and practice; and leave the operation in the beginning.
And you will come to remember the regimen of the flow of sang in case of an accident of the artery according to the right hand side, in the place of this free one.
E si you see of this malady that does not feed this cautery and see the corps of the patient tolerable, cauterize it in the middle of the head with a hole as have been made, and treat the plague within when it is healed.
E if you see, maintain the cautery that has said in the capital of stretching of the artery with an arterial cautery having two points, and this cauterization is better and less conceals.
Capital.
Of cauterization of the pains of gout.
When in the gout there is pain due to cold and it is cured by causes that are lancinating and by another treatment that I have said in the division, and it is not relieved by the pain, then you ignorantly cauterize and this is the name of the point, which is this in form:
And if you want to make a point on the knee, and it is located at the edge of the entire joint area, as it rotates like a wheel, or in the circuit of any example if the pain is in any part. And continue to use the cautery on the knee as little as possible, until you reach the desired location.
And if the cautery makes points all over the knee, and those are correct, and properly cares for the locations inside that are cured.
Capitol, volume 6.
Of cauterization of turmoil.
Turmoil that is cured and not only by the specifics that come through scarlet fever, according to what has been said in the divisions of the diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the specific that happens due to acidity or spasm of the nerves.
When you cure that turmoil with jewels and purgatives and gargles, and do not comfort your cure, then you must cauterize the knee three times: the first time is the point of the thigh, the second a small piece of cloth to temple, and the third the conjunctiva of the eyes.
When you have finished using the hot iron on the opposite side of the injured part, four reductions should be made in the unhealthy part, as it does not appear to be healthy until it becomes healthy.
The form of cauterization is that you cauterize the point with the cautery at the end of the extremity of the scab, which is a small piece over the corner of the head, and on the other side, the length of which is equal to the length of the same part, and reduce the amount of the skin of the specific part of the spine.
This is the form of cauterization, and it is peculiar to the surgeon, the form of which is table. However, that scab is quite small and has few eyes; and it covers a small part of the excessive growth.
And treat the area as it should be after the procedure when it is healthy.
Chapter 7.
On the cauterization of ancient apoplexy.
When ancient apoplexy occurs and is treated as follows and does not confirm your medication and the patient does not have a fever, you should cauterize that part four times: over all the corners of the head; and cauterize and the place of the head, as they have said; and cauterize in the groin. The manufacturing of the cautery is done subsequently when it is cut off.
And it has already been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is lesser; and it is properly placed so that you can proceed.
Capitulum VIII.
The cauterization of forgetfulness is done through inflammation.
Cover them with large pieces of cloth and pills that are moistening.
Then cut off the head of the patient and place it on the center of the described cushion in the chapter of the plasters.
And place those certain veins, where that is the cautery's hand. And do this subsequently according to those measures that I have already said.
And if for those who are cured it is; and otherwise, make three cauterizations on the same side of your head, which are descending from the raised part of the head to the lower part of the chin. And place between each cauterization the largest part of the said, and take care of the cauterization as it is proceeding.
If you add more and the thigh is tolerant, then make the cautery in that place; and if you see more addition, then cauterize it on both sides.
This sentence seems to be discussing a method of treatment for an injury or wound. Here's a possible translation: "Proper care should be taken when entering the affected area; and if cauterization is used, it should be done according to the given form.
I apologize, but the provided text is not in a language
Of cauterization of parasites and mollifying of the entire body.

When using cauterization on the eyelid of a hare when the whiskers turn into parts of the finger and hand, the hare.
When the whiskers of the hare are converted into parts of the fingers and hand, cauterization is performed on those areas with two knives, either by fire or by medical means that are burned.
If cauterization is done with fire, command the patient to look at their whiskers as they are now, and if they are prolonged and unequal, and if the hand is affected, then tighten the nails of the hare with a needle so that it does not cause pain when those whiskers are born.
Therefore, when they are born and unequal, place the patient's head in the first position, and cover the eyelids of the hare's whiskers with a needle, covering the part that is like the figure of a skull, and the beginning of the covering of the whiskers.
And place a cotton ball in the wound or in a plaster of sulfur on the hare.

And then lift your hand and lay it on the area for three days, and place your hand over the affected part to prevent the wound from becoming infected. And treat that area as soon as it is healed.
If the lashes return for some reason and the eyelid is softened, then make another cut with the cauterization over there as you did at first.
If the lashes are still in the eyelid, then make a cut with the cauterization over there when they are raised to the natural location and are not touching the eyelid and do not pull on the eyebrow.
In medicine, the cauterization is this that you command on the member which you see has been extended and torn, and it is called for to make a point of paper on the form of a needle for the tail of the cat.
And take some known and live ginger and mix it with the caustic, and if you do that quickly so that it is not burned; and expand it over the paper which is made in the form of a needle's tail, and place it on the other end of the hilt; and place the hilt cortex in the album of the knife, and the head of the member should be in the top se.
And place the caustic on medicine and press it on that little one and not the member which feels the bite of the medicine, for which bite is in the tail of the member as if it were hot.
And when you perceive that the bite is over, take the medicine and put it on that little one and not the member which feels the bite as if it were hot; and when the bite stops, take the medicine and wash the hilt with water; and consider whether you have lifted the eyelid as it is washed with the hot or cold restraint, that which you have applied; and if not, return over the medicine on the place where it has not been applied before and not denigrated because it is engulfed in your operation and is contracted in the hilt.
And he pauses over the part that is within which the thorn of the gout has been eradicated, and he cares for that part with oil or another inside which it is healthy.
It is necessary for you, you must perform your operation with diligence that does not fall short of medicine, and if the eyelid becomes soft and the pimples on the face are affected, you should repeat your medical treatment over that location where the eyelid becomes soft, and proceed as you did at the beginning, and enter when it is cured.
This is the method of treating a wound.
You know that the lines of men vary according to their size and thickness, and therefore, according to this, your contraction is made.
When examining the patient's body for the purpose of this art, do not neglect the rectal area.

Of cauterization of fistulas that are in the tear duct of the eye.
When you are treating fistulas that have been said in the divisions of the diseases and do not confirm your cure, then you should cauterize the second way as follows: order the patient to hold their head in their left hand, and hold the patient's head steady between their hands in such a way that it is not painful or agitated for the patient's head.
And then pause the cut on the skin of the eyeball or on the panniculus of the flesh over the eye of the patient.
And then ignite the cauterization that is this form:
which is cured, then it is like a cane or a penis of the voltor, from one end to the other, where the cauterization is made.
And if you see, it is piercing into the other end. If you want to be sure of the result, try it.
This is a complex medical text written in a language similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. I will provide a line-by-line translation into English, along with an explanation of the source
Here's the translation of the first line: "And if you open the fistula, and between the sore and the dry, that. If it is not opened, you open it and remove the wound of the patient.
Then place the cautery over the patient, the one that is not ignited, and take a little of the cautery from the heel at the end of the nose, so that your finger or the patient's mouth does not hurt, and you leave the cautery in the grays of the heel and corrupt it.
And if at the beginning of the cauterization, it goes into the bone, that is; and otherwise, you rotate the cauterization once or twice, according to your skill; and after three days, you place a bandage over it, bordering and surrounding it, so that it becomes desiccated within.
However, if it takes several days and is not cured, you leave the acute, corrosive medicine over the patient's bone, when the bone is discovered and is rough, according to what is suitable in the capital city.
And there is another way of cauterization for the fistula, which was first used: you go to the location of the fistula and then open it and pause at that small opening in the fissure where the form of the fistula is; and then put in a certain amount of one unc of plum juice; and take your own finger or a good retaining finger, and do not hurt the patient so that the plum juice does not reach the heel of that; and cover that with the heel of the patient's hand, pouring it into an albuminous liquid or water, four drops of plum juice will adhere to the location of the fistula and cure it wonderfully.
If the fistula is healed, as they have said about the cauterization and cure, then so be it; but if not, you must administer the nose spray and reduce the fistula to the nasal cavity in its proper location.

When the uvula or palate or the gums in the mouth have a swelling and a hard lump appears, and it breaks apart, and becomes inflamed, and a fistula forms, and you treat it with that and not the entire cure, you should use cauterizing fire according to the amount that is received in the fistula, and place the burning fire at the opening of the fistula, and then introduce your hand into the fistula when the hot iron touches the inner part of the gum and the outer part of the gum, and then make a cut or two; and you should cure that according to what they have told us about the cure when it is healed.
If the abscess is healed and it is cured, then so be it; and if not, you must discover the location and burn the corrupt bones according to what will come in their head.
Chapter 20.
Of cauterization of the teeth and softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are rough, and you treat them with medicines and not with fire, you should place the patient's buttocks in the middle of the bed, and ignite the cauterizing iron in the form that will be used, and then insert it into the gum and feel the heat of the fire on the tooth until the tooth is healed.
And lift your tool, and repeat the cauterization on some points according to what you want.
And the patient should drink water with salt and hold it for an hour, and it may swell that way, the tooth is closed and the gum is strengthened and the corrupted moisture is dried out.
Chapter 21.
Of the use of cauterization for tooth pain.
When tooth pain is caused by coldness, or it is frozen, or vermifuge, or not responding to medical treatment, you should cauterize on that spot with two fingers: either with the cauterization of cowhide, or with fire.
Cauterization of the border is when you take cowhide and burn it in the furnace, and then cut it and roll it over the extremity of the hand, and place that on the painful tooth firmly, and press it down strongly until it is cold.
And repeat the cauterization on some points until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
If you see, place wool or a comb along the border of that part, and place it on the painful tooth, and also on the hot iron that has reached the point of the cavity of the tooth.
However, I believe that cauterization is not suitable for all cases or iron, and there may be any food in the body that the sharpness of the iron has not reached the mouth of the patient.
Then ignite the form that you will use, and place it on the tooth and enter with your hand into the cauterization that is hot; and make some observations to see if the pain remains or in that day or in another day.
And make sure that by the pressure of that cauterization, the patient does not bite his mouth with a good border and holds it for an hour and removes it; and this is the form of cauterization.
And cauterize according to what you see as the end, according to what you can do.
And this is the form of the cannula:

If the gout is little, then you stop the cauterization according to the amount of gout, and three times press on the point that is most painful to stop the bleeding that is as much as the fire has burned.
And you take care of that swelling and try to push it in until it becomes healthy.

When cold humors come over the lung's bronchus, and especially when there is coldness of the complexion, you take care that the abdomen be emptied at the beginning of medications with laxatives, and cauterize that point on the gallbladder in the place where it is hollowed out.
And you keep in mind that you do not come to the gallbladder with the cauterization nor burn the colon of the patient but only a little.
And you cauterize that point with another cauterization, you have to make the joint of the col on the back of the spine of the patient. The cautery of this wound should be made in the same manner as previously described.
And apply this remedy to that which is previously mentioned, after it has been made.

And make points in the calf; and apply this remedy to that which is previously mentioned, after it has been made.
And if the cautery already has three ramps for the cauterization, you can make three incisions following this form:

When the head of the gout is dislocated due to lubricated humors and does not stay in place during the return of the hour, and a slight movement causes it to move away, as we have testified, it is necessary to reduce the displacement first, and then return the thigh to its original position or over the opposite side; and raise the knee that is in the part where the gout was dislocated, if the joint is dislocated in the parts of the left side.
And if it is necessary to use cauterization with two heads; and this is the form of it:
E aprop cauteriza la codena entro que penetre aquela entro al autre latz; e vindra la figura de cauterizacio lahoras de iv caps cauteris.
When some points are adjusted according to this count and because they are the cauteries (points).
Then place your hand on the cauterization point and make it stick to the wound, and the member will not hurt for some time until it is comfortable.
If the dislocation is in the parts and tears are made as a result, then make cauterization on the muscle at the clavicle or at the point of the cauterization, where the joint is confirmed and the humidity is moistened and the wound is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When cold humors infiltrate the stomach and moisture enters that extrusion of its complexion and multiplies the rums, and if you continue the curative maneuvers without confirming, then you will find that the wound is over the right dose, and extend your hands and legs, and make cauterization on three points: one cauterization point on the inside of the cheek, and two cauterization points on the two sides of the point, before the figure of the triangular cauterization appears; and elongate between those that are not adjusted to make a fissure.
If the depth of the cauterization is the quantity of the two thirds of the length of the back of the ribs.
And if the figure of the cauterization is this form, and if you want, cauterize with a large cauterization on the midsection of the stomach according to this form; and this is a cauterization according to the form of a circle according to this form:
And if the stomach is cauterized with points at that which of this cauterization frightens: and it is that you are over the stomach with points according to the quantity that you want, and then cauterize that with the cauterization; and then cure that with the cure that is preceded within when it is healthy.
Chapter 27.
Of cauterization of the phlegmatic humor.
When the joint pain in the phlegmatic humor ends due to coldness or wetness or rough wind, and the abdomen is distended by excess excretion, and the patient's stomach is not comfortable, you should cover the abdomen with a cloth, and then cauterize three times according to this form and this quantity on the joint of the hip bones, which relieves the patient's back.
If there is space between the points made by the doctor according to the largest part of the body, and if the points are made according to the length of the corpse.
Do not misunderstand your own hand for the cautery tool.
If the quantity of water that is added is equal to the amount of the specified portion of the cod, and there is no adjustment; and if the patient is lying on the feet of the doctor; and if not, then the patient should be stretched, which has already extended his legs, and raise his arms.
And is it possible that you can cauterize these points with a cautery knife, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art?
And be careful not to overdo it in the cauterization, and add the specified portion of the entire body according to what is added throughout the corpse and passes through the feet, where the cod is subtle; and you know that.
Chapter 28.
Of perforation of the wound by the cautery of the patient.
When an inflammation or abscess appears on the foot and one wishes to know if this abscess is in the flesh or in the skin, then if it is in the flesh, the gout will cause great pain and severity of acute symptoms.
And if it is in the skin of the foot, then the pain is acute and often wears out the doctors' patience with the cure of the patient.
Therefore, this gout should be covered over with the scrotum; and after finding the location of the abscess, it is necessary to ignite the cautery that has been prepared in the previous way; and then take the form of which the next page describes. And ignite that and the cautery within when the entire codpiece is burned, within when it reaches the cipher, within when it comes to sinus.
And cure that with care for the other abscesses within when it is healed.
And this form of cauterization should not be used except for that which is studied in the art of medicine, and in many of those diseases known to cause maladies; however, this has been experimented on some who were ardent about this operation, but nevertheless, it is better for us, and it is useful.

When it is known that some men use cauterization of iron resembling flame and fire, and place it in the location between the back bones, entering it as soon as it comes to the affected area and becomes external, then as has been said in the aposteme of the patient, it should be done.
In this cauterization, there is no fear of injury, as it happens so often in the location where the fistula is not cured.
Capital.
Of the cauterization of the table.
When you cure the table of the wound, it is said that the cure is in the division and not to confirm your cure, then cauterize on it in three or four lines, all of which are correct, of which one is that you make three or four cauterizations or line marks according to the length of the table according to the figure of the cauterizations of the patient, the figure of which has preceded.
And between each cauterization there should be the greatest part of a day or a few days, and the hand of the cauterization is the hand that has been said in the cauterization of the patient.
When you do not understand your own pain; and the patient should be lying on their stomach.
Another way to cauterize is to use a cautery that has no vertiments, which causes the muscle to be dislocated and the codena to be pulled out of the endrey of the table by the doctor.
And if your elevation is that which raises the codena according to the length of the body, then the cauteries are made according to the latitude of the chest.
Then enter the two vertiments, without much effort, into that entrance where those penetrate the codena of the other part.
And extract the cautery; and then it is four cauteries.
If you see, cauterize with a cautery that has three vertiments.
And then you cure the cauterization by pulling it back until it lies flat for a long time, which is more comfortable than the previous causes in the cure.
Capitol xxxi.
The first line of the text, "De cauterizacio de ydropici", translates to "Of
Cauterization is not used in ydrops only in certain cases properly.
When you are treating the gout in the hands that have been divided and do not conform to your treatment, you should cover that with four cauteries around the embolic circle and one cauterization over the stomach, one over the intestine, one over the mesentery, two over the spines of the back, and one at the end of the chest, and one over the stomach. When the quantity of the depth of the cauterization is appropriate for the spine of the back.
And then, the cauterization is cut off by itself, which gets a break after a long time.
And you do not remove the cure of the disease from the cauterization as much as it is covered so that they are added to the hands, and it is hastily put on to help in the care.
The form of the cauterization is like that which is cauterized in the belly, and it is like that which was previously used on the opposite side, and it is that for which both sides are cauterized.

The first source sentence translates to: "The cauterization is performed in this way: On each of the patient's thighs, make two incisions, and on each of these incisions, make a point at the end of the cauterization knife. When the cautery is according to the length of the thigh: and then the other and the other on the other side of the thigh; and over each thigh two cauteries.

And cure those causes that have been said.

Of the cauterization of things from the belly.
When things from the belly are perforated and penetrate through the intestine, it is the digestive and retentive vertut that is affected, which is located in the stomach and intestines, and should be treated with care and not with medications, and sometimes the abdomen suffers cauterization of the vertut exposed, then the largest cauterization is made on the stomach wall according to what was done in the cauterization of the stomach, in the cauterization of the circle and four cauterizations in the circumference of the subtle embryo, in the cauterization of the clavilh subtle; and in the cauterization over the alcatin on alozis great, or two cauterizations.
And if sometimes the excessive humors and the abdomen tolerate it, then the cauterization is made on the pentenilh and over the intestines, and four cauterizations are adjusted on the stomach and part of the thighs, which is a perfect cure of the kind that does not err.

If you find that the stomach of the patient is inflamed and the food of the patient is not being digested, and the face of the patient often blushes, then make points on the stomach with a large cautery, followed by a cauterization on the foot; and a cauterization on the thigh, and another cauterization on the groin, and let the cauterization for some time, and care for him when he is cured.
Capitol, in this context, refers to the capital or highest authority.
From the cauterization of the hernia, appropriate the abscess of it.
When you cauterize the hernia, you should use the cautery that is assembled with the ray. Place that ignited cautery in the hernia abscess, and then insert the tieua last, but when it reaches the orifice of the vein that drains the blood from the part where you found the cauterization, let it stay there until the blood flows back.
And if you find that the pain is too great, then make points on them one by one, following which they have encountered, and care for those as you will, according to what they need when they are cured.
If you cauterize with a large cauterization iron on the thigh, it will not do any good.
Capitol, Chapter 6.
Regarding the cauterization of fistulas that are found in nature, they are called parts of the body.
When nature does not obey the work that has been recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by this, it can be cured by cauterization.
Therefore, when you find any fistula in nature, and it is old, the skin is cracked and corrupted by humidity, and therefore it is appropriate that you cut into it slightly, and then count the depth of the fistula in front of the mentioned hole.
It is believed that the cauterization resembles fire. And then put that cauterization on this fistula, according to the amount in which you cut it.
And continue over that until the burned parts of the corrupted corps are completely blackened, according to the amount of your need.
You must keep watch for inflammation of the nerves and veins; if the fistula leads to the heart of the bladder or the heart of the bowel, you must keep watch at all those places; and do not do this except when the fistula is in the flesh and you think it is not penetrating.
And then take care of the area inside that is healing.
And if the area is sealed, and all materials are removed, and there are signs of healing for a long time, you know that it has been completely cured.
And if the materials are not of the same substance as the old ones, you know that they penetrate or in the prescription of them they corrupt, or they cause pain from those causes which will be remembered in their place.

When in the thorns there is pain due to cold humors or by large ventilation, and if the leg of the patient is swollen, you know that cauterization should be made on that over the thorns as cauterization is made on each thorn as the remembrance of the clavicle is prescribed.
When it is necessary to burn more deeply, the second point is a small one, and there will be three burns in total, so as not to cause excessive pain.

Regarding cauterization of the vagina.
When inflammation occurs in the vagina and it becomes soft and moist due to cold and humidity, causing the urethra to lose urine, then cauterize that part with a cautery over the vaginal opening, starting from the clitoris and continuing to the right side, and also from the left side.
And the length of each cautery is according to the number of points; and cauterize that part with the cautery at the lower part of the two, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And the cautery is made according to how it is processed.

Regarding cauterization of the uterus.
When cold and humidity occur in the uterus, and it is prohibited to make an incision, and the menstruation of the woman becomes corrupted, and the provocation of them is delayed, and pain occurs from them, then cauterize that part with three cauteries around the umbilicus as has been said in the cauterization of the vagina; and cauterize over the lower part of the two, or with two cauteries, and make the cautery clavilh.
The text you've provided appears to be a medieval medical treat
ion, specifically about cauterization for treating dislocated ankles. Here's the translation of the first line: "Capitol xl." This likely refers to a specific chapter
When cold humors infiltrate the ankle area, and cause swelling of the joint, and if the leg is shortened compared to the other, then the thigh should be extended over the other when compared to it. When the location of the dislocation is affected by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, it is customarily called a dislocation by doctors.
Then cover the area with cauterizing the thigh with the point of the cautery, as it is customary to do in order to prevent the intestine from coming out, and so that the intestine does not fall into the circle's location.
And the point of the cautery that precedes the form in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this point is not available to you, cauterize that point with three points of cauterization on the cauterizing point.
And let the point of cauterization be according to the quantity of the spirit of the entire codeine; and attend to that part when it is cured.
Chapter 41.
Of the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs in the thigh region and is caused by the cold and dampness of the humor, the thigh is treated as it has been said and not confessed, and it is common, that you cover the thigh with large amounts of pills made of herbs or artificial pills or semblances; and then cauterize that part.
And the hand of the cauterization is followed by two hands: either the cauterization is made with hot irons, or with fire.
Then use two scientific hands, one of which is the cauterization made on the edge of the thigh, and then make three cauterizations in this way; and it will be good for those parts. And the space between each cauterization is according to the size of the part, whether it is made with a sharp or large iron.
Some may have the cauterization on the top of the thigh, over the head of the ankle, for there are four cauterizations.
And if you wish, cauterize at the circle that is prescribed in the form of the dislocation of the ankle, and it will be a circle that is contiguous and burns the entire column.
And this is the hand of the cauterization in cases where pain is adhered to the ankle and is not extended within the thigh.
If it is extended within the thigh, then make two cauterizations on the thigh over the location where the wound of the ankle will be; and make a cauterization on the vulva for four parts of the part that is the most swollen.
If the cautery is sharp, and its depth depends on the amount of spleen pain.
If the joint pain spreads to the area where the feet are located, then cauterize this area with the intestine or hernia, using three points or four or more if directed by the doctor.
If the joint pain spreads to the area where the thigh is located, then cauterize this area with the cautery, using a sharp one.
In all cauterization, do not use the cautery as a nerve or large artery, and be careful so that you do not harm the patient's thigh more or cause contraction.
And you have already seen one and another of those that were cauterized on the cavity and the end of the cauterization, and the bed was inflamed within when the tumor succeeded in the foot, and it was burned and corrupted throughout the foot. And a hot solution of belly, and so the death.
If the pain is in two parts, then cauterize each according to this manner.
When the cauterant is applied, it resembles a circle of iron, where the circuit is the largest part of a bone or a small part of a tooth; and it should be made with the largest size of a thorn from a hawthorn or a small part of a thorn from a rose.
Then, draw another circle; and the space between them is the quantity of the pulse; and those circles are cut into two parts; and the length of those curves is a pulse or two pulses, and the points of the ferrule are slightly visible in the circles; and this is the form of it:
Then, it should be ignited in the fire after it is rolled up and gives off sparks, and it should be placed on the tip of the thumb, with the thigh caught under the latex. And then, it is cauterized with three cauterizing points in a vein.
And after three days, it is washed with that; and the border is plastered and the wound is cleaned for several days; and it is cured when it becomes healthy.
The first line of the text is: "o, filhs, de aquesta specia de cauteri pauc havem usat per la terror del reguardament de lu, e per aquo que paucs havem trobatz les quals reguardan sobre lu.
When points are made on the affected part with a sharp cautery, and it becomes red and swollen, then...
When you make two circular incisions in the skin, passing through the perforated tissue at the corner of the nostril; the length of the sides should be equal to two noses or thumbs.
And if the space between them is equal to the quantity of their size; and they are placed further and further apart, and they hold each other in this form:
And place your hand over the ankle of the patient's thigh, and compress the other part over the ankle; and take a wet cloth and fold it between two circles, and the quality of that is as small as possible, and it is done in about an hour, and the patient suffers from the bite and the adhesion of the — when the bite ceases, that becomes like the heat of fire.
And raise your hand and clean it with the instrument, and remove all the water from the ankle that is wet.
When the patient lies down for three hours and rests on that border where the nail of the big toe is located, and when the doctor lifts it up and runs his hand over the area, this is beneficial.
And cure that part with an ointment that is healthy inside where that part is located.
And if the pain is extended to the thigh or leg, make the statue in it that contains water according to what is made in the ankle joint.
This is the water-filled statue, and I have already written about this in the treatise on the correction of medicines. Recipe for alkali and caus that is not extinguished in one part, and throw it in a new wave of the quality of which the part is left with a small hole, according to the quantity that enters into the ray.
And leave the fountain of the other wave that is carried, and put over the alive alkali and caus with water two-thirds of which are needed for those by a certain, and say that you understand these am the tieua but for good compression, and press the hole that leaves the hot water in the wave carried.

From the cauterization of joint pain.
When the joints in the ankles and knees are broken, and the intestines are protruding from the hernia towards the genitals, and this starts to happen frequently, then you should immediately call for help, as you command me to tell the patient to reduce his food intake on that day and to use gentle causes for the fenestra in the abdominal wall.
And follow the patient's thighs over the abdomen, and command him to hold the abdomen as soon as he feels any pain or sees that the hernia is getting bigger or protruding.
And return the intestine to its place and hold it there as soon as you feel any pain or see that the hernia is getting bigger or protruding, and then measure the extent of the rupture over the femur and note the location of the endpoint in the subpectoral parts of the chest.
And use the cauterization method that this is the form of it:
when it is red and swollen with pins and needles. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then place the cautery over that spot with your hand, and enter it when you can feel the pubic bone entering the thigh; and repeat this on the other side if you have not succeeded in the first attempt.
Observe carefully the condition of the intestine at the time of your cauterization, as you do not burn that intestine because it does not come out of the thigh or other great harm.
You know that if you do not feel the bones when you use the cautery, your operation is not successful.
And make sure that the cautery for children is subtle according to their size and measure.
And care for the area of the cautery for three days, making sure that the burn is not too deep in the scar of the fire.
And care for it so that others may be cured when it is healthy.
When the wound is on the patient's back and has been covered for four days, it is sealed and no longer causes pain.
And if you pause the nutrition of the patient according to the length of time it takes for the cure of the patient's stomach, and the intestine does not protrude due to the effort of healing, then...
And if you want to leave for four days, give the patient a slight dose of medicine, and hold it for other four days.

Capitol 46.
Of cauterization by twisting.
When pain persists in any member due to causation or percussion and does not relieve for a long time and is not satisfied with the care of the physician, it is necessary to cauterize with a point cautery.
And the cauterization of each member should be according to its size and width, its depth and development, and the location of the twist and the pain in the member.
If the patient is healed by the first cauterization, it is; and if not, continue to cauterize over it. Four out of five of those pains are considered points of one member to another, because they cover that you can get them within that part when the other part is healed.

Some leeches are cut with a sharp cautery for great advantage, and it is the specialty of leprosy that is caused by putrid mildew and melancholy.
When you want to cauterize that part, consider if leprosy is present and whether it has been cured as they have said in the division and not done, nor this, and fear about the thigh that corruption comprehends the entire body of him and all the composition of him, and then cauterize that on the head as you have cauterized: one on the left side of the head, and one further down, and the front to the end of the hair; and two on the back, over the nape or servant.
Lastly, the cauterization is made a little inside the bones when it starts to press on them, and their scars are displaced, so that the expiration of heavy vapors is relieved from him; and it is cauterized on the table next as desired.
If leprosy has already expanded over the thigh and manifestly appears, you should cover that it is cauterized as they have said in the head: and cauterize on the extremity of the nose, and cauterize on two points on the upper lip, and cauterize on two points on the collarbones, and cauterize on two points on the spine of the neck, and cauterize on one point near the shoulder, and on the shoulder, and on two points on the ankles, and on one point at each ankle, and on two points on the knees, and on two points on the muscles, and on two points on the tendons of the feet; and cauterize that on all the joints of the said members and of the feet, and on every toe of the feet, and on the fascia of the thighs.

You know that the fewer the cauterizations, the less beneficial and less conducive; and you know that the thigh does not have pain in the cauterization, so as they have them, according to what has already happened, since the body of the patient has become stupefied.
And know that the cauterizations are large or small according to the limbs and joints, according to which species of tools precede them.
Then cure the cauterization with flour of errors, honey, and the other cure when it is cured.

When the pointed cautery is inserted into the skin of the back, a few centimeters. And with proper care, that part will heal within a short time.
When some ulcers are cauterized with a pointed cautery that ends in the more or less painful areas of the feet, spine, and vertebrae, and the nerves that cause the pain are located, it is made larger.
Only pressure should be applied to that unless it is known in the anatomy of the member and the exit of the nerves of all the limbs moved.

The text you provided appears to be a medieval medical treatise written in
A language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. Here's the translation of
Corrodent" refers to corrosion or rotting, which can occur in the body and damage the tissues. It is similar to how dry wood burns when heated, like how fuel wood burns. In medieval medical terms, this could refer to a condition where the body's tissues are damaged by an infection or other underlying
If you sometimes see that corrosion in the place where it suffered cauterization by heat, then you should use few cauterizing pins and larger ones as needed in that place where there is corrosion." This suggests that cauterization using heat (cauterizing pins) can be used to treat corrosion or damage to the tissues. The number of pins used and their size may depend on the severity of the corrosion and the location in the body.
And if you cauterize it entirely, so that the corrosion is completely eradicated and does not leave any cause for it." This means that if the cauterization is complete and successful, the corrosion should be completely eliminated and there should be no further issues or complications.
And follow that for three days, and place your hand over the cauterized sites every three hours, and if you see that the scars are all completely eradicated and the corrosion is also completely eliminated, then you can stop following this treatment." This suggests that the patient should continue to monitor the treated areas for three days after the cauterization, and check for any signs of incomplete healing or further issues. If the scars have completely disappeared and there is no sign of corrosion, the patient can stop following the treatment.
When treating that affected flesh, one should apply a remedy.
If after three days the flesh shows signs of healing and does not become corrupted, then so be it; otherwise, you should repeat the cauterization over the areas where corruption is present.
And if corrosion is treated by some medical practitioners using acupuncture, then that is the appropriate location for cauterization. However, cauterization should be used with care to remove puss.
And I have already mentioned the treatment of the medical practitioner in the division, and therefore, when that occurs, take it.
Capital, Chapter 3.
On the cauterization of claws and other similar parts.
Wounds visible on the parts of the foot that have been affected by claws and are causing them to be large, heavy, and painful; and in those cases, apply cauterization twice with a hammer and apply cauterization with fire and cold lead.
However, cauterization with fire is that which resembles the pain of a volt, which is made of iron according to the quantity that contains the claw of the entire part, and is made of fine threads.
And apropos pause that spark on the lock, and apropos turn your hand over it, but use your cautery around the lock, as the cautery will reach the depth of the lock. And let that stay for three days after you begin to rub it with brac. And apply that with pure grape must salvaged from the vine, and let the plaster stay on it for a day, so that it may be completely eliminated from its parts.
And care for the area as it is healing, and make it healthy.
And if it does not convert, and visible inflammation appears on the surface of the body, particularly in the chest and feet, you must administer poultices made of herbs or iron or pennyroyal, and place them over the lock; and let that stay on the lock for a short time, and apply your hand to it, and turn it around as you compress with your hand, and keep the margin of the canula in contact with the edge of the clasp, and draw out the herb through the clasp's opening; and wait for the wound to heal for an hour, and then replace it, so that the lock may completely remove its parts.
When you approach those who have pain in their joints, go in and handle all of them as they are in the body.
And treat those who have scars from the claws, as the flesh has been eradicated by the doctor's tools.
Capitol, Chapter III.
Of Cautery for Tremors.
When you have tremors caused by cold in the nerves or from fever of that kind, or for some other reason, you should know that you must cauterize that part with four or five caustics on the spines of the back, between each spine with a cauterization; and on the chest and stomach, you should cauterize olive oil.
And if the tremor of the patient is cured and quickly improves the health of the diseased part.
Capitol, Chapter V.
Of Cautery for Accidents to the Chest.
When in the chest there is an opening and pustules on those parts that are caused by fatty corrupt materials; therefore, at the beginning as it appears, that it should be cauterized on all sides of the fistula with a subtle cautery or with a hot iron or with long estrus; or with slow cauterization.
When certain warts are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method; and it is not doubtful, and the superfluity is broken, making those healthy.
However, I believe that this is not the proper method for evacuation in bunionectomy.
Capital sixth.
Of the cauterization of the leakage of blood due to an incision in the sciatic nerve.
There are too many warts on the sciatic nerve that is cut due to the plague that deforms it, or you must make an incision of the gangrene or cauterize the member, and then it seems better, but it is difficult to maintain that.
Therefore, when you cut at this point, you should cut your thigh and the orifice of the sciatic nerve, and then place your hand on that to stop the warts entering that leakage of blood that was previously cut, and that does not come out.
And then pause in the fire the green cauterizations few and many, by name, and exhale over them when they are not ignited.
And carefully take either a small or large piece of the area and place it over the location where the artery is about to break, firmly press on that vein which will remain in the said joint, and then cauterize it from within so that it is contained and held in place.
And if the joint is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you remove the said joint and withdraw the cauterization, then take another cauterization firmly from the others that are prepared in the fire, and therefore do not cease to make another one so that the joint remains held.
And remember that you will not burn the nerves that are here, and that another malice will come over the thighs.
And you know that when the artery is out of joint, it is not possible to hold the joint in place, and especially when the artery is large, if not by one of four hands: by cauterization as said before, or by extraction if not extracted, four if extracted, the extremities of the nails are burned and held in place, or that it is lifted by a part or by a strong structure, or that they are held on the medicines from which the virtue is restricted to the joint; and they are firmly held by the pulley and the constrictive device.
When one administers a decent restraint to the patient's limb and stricture of the thighs or groin, or due to causes that are burning or resembling, it does not bring comfort unless it is ointment.
If the doctor or physician is not present and there is no ointment, then one should make a point on the affected vein as they have said, and understand the great pressure that the sick part of the plague has within the thigh, and over the artery it is not damaged; and from the artery it is washed with very cold water when the sick part is cut and swollen; and there should be no need for cauterization or medicine.
Of incision and perforation and ventosae and of fleebotomy and of plagues and their similitudes.
In the first book, it has been said in total malady where cauterization is convenient and necessary for medicine, and the occasions and causes of it, and the instruments in those cases are needed in the forms of cauterizations; and I have ordered the chapters of the subincision of the head within the feet.
In this capital, for that purpose, to make it known to the applicant what is needed, I will proceed with this sentence.
When you begin this procedure, son, remember that in this capital there is fear for you that it is the first capital of cauterization.
And for this reason, son, with great caution, that in the operation which is in this capital, it is necessary to empty the vein or make an incision over the aposteme or aperitum or exsiccation of the plague or extraction of the sweat or incision of the stone and its resemblance. And for all those who are accompanied by fear and trembling and in the most of them the death.
And you remind you that on you this does not fall, in the which is the cauterization, for some see that you must have hands of men who are hands of men who have had maladies. And from them it is clear that you must go to your malady and you have to leave this life, and so for the vehemence of this which finds in the malady, and for the long time of the malady of the other, and the malady is a poverty of the quality that means death.
When those are the things that give you power and knowledge, you expect that cure, and the misery of the sick person is pernicious.
For you do not allow yourself to be convinced by what appears to you as the cause of this maneuver; and your caution should be greater than presumption and your greed, and you should not assume any cause for this except a certain science that proves it to you, and which you must follow in succession.
And use in the care of all your patients for prognosis and indication of the one who is converted to health, which is an aid to you over acquisition of fame and memory, praise and glory.
Oh, children, God is in you the divine understanding and does not leave you without direction and protection, for this is in its own power.
And you and order this capital distinguished by capital second that precedes in the capital of cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that you may be able to ask for that which you demand from this and of the kind that has need.
The first line of the text is "Capitol primier.
This line translates to: "Of the cure of water which is contained in the head of children.
This line translates to: "You know that this child's illness is seen in the head of the child, and when the night comes, you must shave the child's head.
This line translates to: "And some are seen because of a damp cause which is not cleaned.
This line translates to: "I have not seen this disease in children alone; and in all those that I saw were suffering from death, and by that I have seen less work done in them.
This line translates to: "And you have seen that the head of a child was full of water, and its head was very magnificent until it could not be touched because of its great size, and less so when the moisture increased until it was burned.
This line translates to: "And this moisture is added between the ribs and the bone, or it is added on top of the bones in the chest.
When the operation is on that side, if the humidity is between the vertebrae and the bone and the anesthesia is lacking, you cover that in your own location of the head with a fissure in the latitude, and its length is two notches within which the humidity runs, and this is the form of the sputum:
If humidity increases and the apostemia becomes greater, then there are two fissures following this method:
If the humidity reaches the bones, then you can see the commissures of the scalp completely exposed and the water is streaming when you press on that side with your hand, but not in the parts of the fingers and not at your wrist. Cover that you press on the side of the head with three fissures following this method:
And apply the extracted incision throughout the humidity; and stretch the fissures at the edges and plumes; and press down on it and insert the needle into the fourth day, and clean the limb and treat the wound that you had, and stretch the cap with equal force; and moisten the dry member that is comfortable and healthy.
And another method of incision is considered, which considers the magnitude of the apostemia and the collection of water, but some are less seen in the occipital region, or in the part below, or on the right, or on the left; and then pay attention to the incision where the apostemia and the repletion of water appear, and follow what is possible for you.
You should observe that the artery is not being cut and that blood vessels are still flowing in the limb, and that the patient's leg is swelling due to this fluid buildup.
Chapter Three.
When you cut the arteries of the heels or chest, and it is stopped, and no cure is found in this, then the next course of action is to cut those two arteries at this point.
And know that when you want to cut the arteries that the patient wants to see, and cut through the area as quickly as possible with a sharp tool, and strengthen the leg of the patient; and consider where the vein is located; and the places of each over the places where the ankles are swollen, and they are hidden in so many men.
And know that you should cut on the artery you want to see, and cut through each one of the parts that are closest to the bone, and it will be easy to enter inside the skull, and it will be like this at the height of the head.
If you wish, enter the spatulum further and press the artery against that to stop the bleeding at those points.
And if the length of the incision is two and a half inches, then when any vein is cut, the vein will exude blood and pulse, which will fall down due to the frequent beating of the heart.
If the artery does not appear at the compress, then you should measure the circumference of the thigh and divide it by three, and then make an incision, and then enter the bone.
And if you cover the amount of blood that comes out with a cloth, and then try to squeeze it out as little as possible, and then follow the amount that appears on the thigh and the repletion of the artery of the patient, then...
And if you consider the plague, and then if you remain on the bone any cause of inflammation, then you should cut there to prevent the cautery from coming out.
And if you tighten the plague with plasters and bandages, and then cure it as soon as it is healed.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the text you provided is not
From the extraction of the arrowheads that are in the templates.
When an old wound or scar is caused by cold humors and poor quality in the hamstrings of the legs, or an old scar that resembles those, and it is treated with the tools of medical curacy and it does not satisfy, we have found this extraction of the arches from the thighs or cauterization of those parts that have shown themselves.
The tool for the operation and extraction of those is the arch that raises the hairs on the thighs; and understand the apparent arc in the thigh that you showed me with your hands, and it is hidden only in a few people by the force of the humors.
And if it is hidden from you, the neck of the wound is strengthened by some cloth; and place the humor on the location with a rough or dry cloth or water that enters where the apparent arc seems to be located in your thigh. And take the salve of this form: And you heat the cord with that form which is easy to pass through when you reach the arc; and get out of it and extract that from the parts surrounding it when you extract that from the cord and discover that of the tunics which are those that are now on your wound, in total.
If the artery is thin, cover it with a cloth at its tip, and insert it into the wound one by one according to the number of fingers that are stretched along the ends of the limbs and are contracted, and no blood will flow out, unless they are not inserted properly, as then the sac would not be able to stretch.
And remove the sac of three units of blood.
If the artery is large, cover it with two cloths in two places, either by folding or by tying it with strings, and do not cut it off when the putrefaction begins during the consolidation of the plague and blood will flow out.
And cut off the excess that is between two limbs; and do this at that time or at another time.
If you want, cauterize the area with a cauterizing tool entered into the bone through the cauterizing incision, and stay in place of that work piece.
It is better work if the patient does not have fever or is not in a state of ecchymosis; for cauterization is one of those causes that help to dry out the more humid parts, and it is better in its effects.
When extracting the arching bones that compress the ancient place of the knee, and they are placed over the smooth points, and it is recommended that the doctor's care is applied to make the flesh nicer and the calves healthier inside.
And while you work on another part of the joint, do not tighten that joint, or use cauterization, or place something under the knee, and tighten your hand inside to keep the joint from loosening. And if the cause of that is not in your power, then stop on the tip about the location where the joint is compressed, and wrap the location with something wet to prevent coldness inside as soon as the acuity returns, and it will be stronger afterwards.
And that is why it is recommended to cauterize the vein during the extraction of the arching bone because it has two points of cutting, which you have seen the two locations, and paused for a while, as soon as they reach the bone and incise the vein in two locations, so that it is elongated enough between the extremities of this, so that not all are consolidated by this cauterization.
This is the form of cauterization:
When the sharpness of the two cotyledons is exemplified. However, if the sharpness is more subtle than two cotyledons, that is, if it is more acute than two cotyledons proper to each part of the flesh, and does not cause speedy death.
Therefore, if there is any swelling in those places, the heat of the fire is held in those and the flesh is slowly cut away.
And this work is better than all other works and leaves a trace.
When the space between the two cotyledons is the quantity of the swelling of the said.

Of the cure for the heart of acute and acidic warts of the nails.
When the warts are acidic and the heart is affected by those veins which are over the test of the skull, and do not relieve any cause for the cure of medicine, and sometimes the face of the thigh becomes enraged and feels like the front of a walking stick, and the toes become extinguished, humid as if the feet of their ancestors were cut, the nails are scalped by the sharpness of the tears, the ancient bitterness in the cure of these operations is spared, and the cure is not neglected.
The first source sentence translates to: "And it is that you command the patient's thigh to cut the hairs that are on the front, and then insert three incisions into the front, separated by the length of the front. The second source sentence translates to: "And if the length of the incision is two thirds, then the first one should be engaged distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the front location, and the second one should be separated by a small movement of the fingers that are on the lacrimal, and the third one should be on the other side.
The third source sentence translates to: "And keep the incision of the wounds that are in two layers, and extend your hand for the continuation of the bones of the jaw. The fourth source sentence translates to: "And if the space of each incision is adjusted to three thirds.
The fifth source sentence translates to: "And if you have for me a sponge or cloth that absorbs moisture and dries the wounds.
The sixth source sentence translates to: "And place the sponge between two sharp ends, of which this is the form of the incision of the wound:". This is about the division of the second incision. The entire chain that is between two incisions is the one that is over the bones, and it should move within the second incision. Then go through this suture and enter into the first incision another tool called a scalpel, sharp on one side and dull on the other.
Then pause the edge of that sharp blade with the meat attached to the chain, and the edge of the lion's tooth on the bones, and push that into where it came out of the fissure, and cut off all those parts that descend from the head to the feet.
May it be continued with the incision at that point, and it should be moved within the fissure into the other fissure.
And push that corner of the sanctuary until the joints are free.
Then stop in any fissure that has a rough edge, and place yourself over those powders that are wet with oil and vinegar, and look to see if it does not have an inflammation of the cauterization.
On the third day after the limb is loosened and a large amount of watery or fecal matter is administered, and proper care is given to this, it is appropriate to use a benzoin ointment or rose oil and other remedies that are beneficial for healing the plagues.

The best cure for this condition is to command the patient to raise their arm, and then insert a finger into the hole of the shoulder, making a small incision in the upper part of the shoulder (and starting from the left temple to the right temple; and it should be inserted within the bone; and extend your finger into the joints of the fingers that are not hard enough for mastication), after which you will discover the bone.
Dry the entire area with a sponge or cloth and place it between the edges of the fissure, either on the outside or inside of the fissure. And then apply some powdered drugs that do not cause allergies and are safe to use.
When you see that the aposteme has decreased, apply a poultice made of powdered drugs that do not cause allergies and are safe to use. Mix four parts of flour and four parts of collodion, and make a plaster with them and apply it to these wounds on the native skin.
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided text is not in
It seems like you've provided a new line of text, but it's not clear if it's part of the same medieval medical treatise or if it's a separate
This line appears to be discussing the cause of gout, which can be one of four types: mineral deposits (like flint or iron), plant-based (like chamomile or fava beans), or a result of fluid imbalance (like water and urine). It's also possible that gout is caused by some unknown entity.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And then pause in the circuit of the hair around some parts of cloth or wool, and extend the hair to the parts thereof, where four turns are not forgotten for these causes.
And if it is not done, you administer an extraction of the affected part with the instrument called the epicicarious gesture, which is as follows:
And if the gesture is forgotten, then so be it; and otherwise, you administer the extraction of the affected part with a subtle and few duplication of the instrument.
And if it is not forgotten for this, you make a cannula of armor and insert the end of the cannula into the opening of the hair and close it with wax and ointment softened so that the cannula is not cut until it is closed. And then extract from the upper part of the hair where too many turns are not forgotten as follows:
But if it is not forgotten in this maneuver, you hold the hair with your thumb and index finger or with the palm of your hand, pressing the hair on one side with a certain quantity, and then roll it over gently to the end of the hair and place it on the crown comfortably. And then enter the anus through the anus' opening with ease, and remove the feces from the anus.
And if you do not forget all the causes that have been mentioned, then use your hand to close that hole that leads to the testicle, either with a cautery or a spasm.
And the hand of the anus is that you start to close the thigh of the vein sephasica and extract from there the second hand of the virtue of the patient, and then put that cezer between your hands and convert the anus into parts, and then make a small fissure in the edge of the anus' anus and let the sweat out in the place where it is most needed. And if the fissure of the lunar figure goes into the foot, and the foot is wasted, leave that part as you can with an appropriate instrument; and at that time, treat the fissure with speed, and heal that which has gone in.
And if the cause of the fissure is one of the greasy ones that you believe and are inflamed, then administer the cure and extraction of it; but if you do not obey your physician's orders, then you should take subtle spumons according to this form: When treating the abscess of that wound which is located in the thigh, administer the following:
Do not apply this remedy if you think that the wound has already been hydrated by the steam of the thigh, and instead rest it with cold compresses, and then remove any stitches or sutures using a gentle touch, or as instructed by the doctor, as this will help to reduce the extraction of the wound.
In the water that is inserted into the thigh, which is used for nasal congestion to alleviate symptoms, fill the thigh with ice, and place the water on the part of the thigh where the wound is located, and if this is forgotten, do not worry; otherwise, take a few pieces of ice and leons according to the length of the said, and heat them in the fire, and the patient should put one of them on the part of the thigh that has been treated and touch it with another piece of ice over the same part of the thigh. Therefore, do not continue this remedy until all of the wound has been forgotten.
Therefore, do not continue this remedy until all of the wound has been forgotten. When the urine has been excreted, take a piece of paper or cloth and place one end of it in the urethra and extend the other end outside until it is completely empty.
Then use another piece of cloth and insert it into the urethra as many times as possible until all the urine has been excreted, and then pull out the canula that is left outside as described for the extra-urinary tissue.
In the extraction of a foreign body from the urethra, if it is small, it can be easily removed with gentle forceps and as described in division; but if it is large and causes harm to the genital area, the removal of the foreign body should be done with care and attention, and the cause of the foreign body should be determined by examining all other causes that may be present in the urethra.
In the extraction of a worm from the urethra, if you follow the procedure described in division and the treatment of distillations and do not satisfy your curiosity, then cover the urethra with a cloth while you are outside.
If here appears any cause of the gallstones, take out that part with a gentle gesture or with one of these subtle ones, but if no such cause is found, take a rigid canula further ahead and stretch it wide, this being the form of the gallbladder: Enter the subtle extremity into the abdomen according to the amount that suffers from the gallbladder; and then push it with a strong force, and make sure of your movements, entering until all the gallstones are removed.
If you do not obey my instructions, then I will take it and close it in the circuit of the canula as we have said; then administer distillations of those that have already expanded in the treatment of gallstones, and find this in the chapter of distillations.
And is your effusion the one that funds the medicinal oils in the abdomen with this instrument of which this is the form of the gallbladder: Make that of silver or of gold, further ahead, in which there is a small hole, and stretch it wide.
And so it is that when one is in the cavity of the urethra, where it is necessary to be, then follow these steps: If you wish, take the needle and wrap it gently at the end of the urethra, and place it in the concavity of the anus, or on any herb, or whatever medicine you want in the urethra — and that is in the anus —, and insert the needle into the concavity of the anus and expel it from there with your hand while the oil is expelled into the concavity of the anus and the thigh feels the oil.
And if it is wrapped in the thigh, it has already been cut with a small focus. And keep in mind that the cause that you will distill in the anus is not too poor, and that the medicines of the anus do not suffer from this.
Chapter VII.
Of the cure for hair loss in the anus.
Some children have lost their hair from the bellies of their mothers and wives, and this has already happened in men, baldness on the skin of the anus due to plague or nothing in it; and this baldness is seen in the prepuce of the anus that does not see the virtue, and some are in the deformed parts.
When something happens in the body of the patient that is not understood, it is in the major dispositions of difficult treatment.
When you have succeeded in achieving the desired effect, make sure to place the anus of the patient at the sun and look towards that direction. If you see apparent swelling, open that small sponge which is this form of it:
If the end of it where the smallest latitude is located, of which one part is acute and the other not; and the sponge is made of two lemons according to which does not cause pain at the anus.
And if the swelling is due to fleshy tissue in the anus or in the meat of the patient, use those small sponges and press with that great facility that it is completely inside when the whole flesh is removed.
And if the swelling is in the prepuce of the anus, use a small lemon sponge and heat it up a little, and then place it in the anus of the patient.
And if you see swelling in the anus that the patient finds difficult to open due to gravity, try to ease the pressure of the anus and make sure not to harm the nerves of the anus.
When the second quantity of the ample of the thread is placed in the Egyptian ointment; and do so for a few days until you are sure of the consolidation of the plague; or if you take any powder and thrust it into the water and sprinkle it over it according to your liking and use it; and if the glove has already been attached, then cover that powder with another one of the same kind that you throw around the glove that you enfold in a cloth that is red or pink, if it is the plague of the hand; and then take care of that within a few days until it becomes healthy.
If you have diarrhea, then submerge the sponge or cloth in water and place it on the abdomen, and use another remedy that restricts the flow of diarrhea, which is called in the book of distillation.
Capitulum VIII.
Of the cure of asthenia that ends up in the eyes.
Asthenia that ends up in the eyes is caused by some humors that are cold, and some of them are dry.
Therefore, if you hold those points or knots, and separate those spots from the skin, and place your hand over those areas according to their shape, then it is appropriate.
If there is pain in the flow of venous blood, then you should make points on those areas with a fine cautery.
And the best cauterization is when the incisions and visible veins return to their original state when the cause of those spots is removed; and if the points are burned, those spots become charred and do not return.
Chapter 6.
Treatment for giant cell that goes to the eyelids of the horses.
Visible spots on the eyelids of horses are caused by some cause that is associated with giant cell in its strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called giant cell.
And there is an addition of thick moisture on the eyelids inside and outside.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you should consider it if the giant cell is proceeding in water that appears from the eyelid and is not good for the whole case; and the cause of this is unknown.
Here comes the translation of the first source sentence:
If the figure is large, you adjust it with stitching; and care for that entrance which is healed.
If it is little, it will not be good for that part of the body where the gout restores and regenerates.
If the swelling is decreasing in the parts of the eyelid, you must cleanse the surface of the eyelid, then lift it up and suspend it by one hand, and if the eyelid becomes longer due to incision, there will be no effect in that case.
And after the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and cure the place with this that is regenerative when it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the cure for the swelling in the upper eyelid.
Swelling is caused by the grains that are generated in the layers of the upper eyelid, and especially in children, aggravates the wrinkles of those and causes them to cry; and they cannot see the clearness of the sun because of this that lags on those.
And you sometimes see those swellings on the cheeks all the time, and on them when they sleep; and on their eyes you put wet coverings, which have already healed inflammation, and an apparent appearance of dryness in the eyelid; and if you tell me that with your hands you put it on those, I will put it on them.
When a man cuts the thigh of his patient, it is necessary to place a cushion under him and hold his hand, and the wound should be made according to the size of the part that contains the bone marrow, and the wound should be closed over it and pressed with a piece of cloth from the entire perimeter so that there is additional adhesion in the ring, and the ring should not be larger than the fissure made in flapotomy.
The more you pull on the tendon, the more it will be processed through the arcernach according to the shape of white gray matter.
Therefore, place a cushion under those parts that you have separated between the thighs and roll them around the left and right sides within which they are disarmed.
And do not adjust in the fissure for which you have spumed that it does not reach the hip and causes pain in that area.
If your tendon does not appear at the beginning of the fissure, then adjust in the fissure a small ease factor within which you process the tendon; and take away the cushion that has been said; and place a cushion under the water and see if it fits well and pauses over the location and stretches those am polvils.
When they have taken out the purse and paused it in the cavity of the fissure, so that what remains of that humidity does not remain.
And after that, care for that to make it heal.
If you accidentally puncture the cauterization site, treat that with plasters inside to make it heal.
Capitol, Chapter XI.
Of the hands of the thief.
When the thief's eyes are red from the adjustment of natural and old lashes, treat those as if they were tears of the eye, such as constant lacrimation and mollification of the eyelids and skin inside which it is caused by tactile damage to the eye, and cure in four hands: either by cauterization at a focus; or by acute medicine according to what is said in the chapter of cauterization; or by etching and suture; or by cannas according to what you say.
And so, when you close the opening of the wound with your thumb, convert the eyelid of the eye to your left hand, and if it is converted, do not remove it; and if not, insert a needle into the point in which the pus is located behind the eyelid, and make it penetrate through that point, and then it will be - the edge of the eyelid on which the lashes lie, the lashes themselves, and pull out the tail from the points inside the eyelid, and convert it to the edge of the eyelid.
And if there is any sign of inflammation in the corner of the eyelid, and the lacrimal major is affected within the lacrimal pit; and then extract the flea and place the eyelid slightly open with the side or tip of a needle, and cover it over the eyelid, and let it be as if it were a small knife of mortar.
However, I believe that the figure is second to the amount of inflammation of the eyelid, for it is already differentiated among men, and from those it is the ones who indicate that it should be inscribed on the eyelid in great quantity according to the quantity by which the eyelid is softened.
And if there is any sign of inflammation on the surface of the lower lines that you have seen, and then begin from the lacrimal major into the lacrimal minor. And if your fissure is close to the natural eyelashes, it should be as if it were the largest of the king's.
And place the ointment in one of the two angles of the neck, and scrape it all, and adjust it to the curve of the two lips of the mouth or the tip of fine wool, and remove the sand, and let it adhere if you wish to use it over two folds of the eyelashes for some reasons, but if not, do not care.
When the incision of the testicles is made, it should be allowed to heal within three to four days, and proper care should be taken.
If you wish, close the wound with sutures, and apply a remedy that dries and constricts to prevent the eyelid from becoming inflamed. The suture is better, and therefore it is advisable to follow the instructions for proper care.
However, there may be concern about the thigh, and it is a good operation, and not in fear.
And another method is to apply the ointment to the eyelid, and if you see that the appearance of the eyelid is like a piece of meat, then raise the eyelid by three incisions, separated by this form:
If it is not possible to close the wound, and it does not tear, then take an elastic that has a thread and put it in the part where the eye is, and insert the other finger into the larger lacrimal duct, and the other finger into the smaller one, and adjust between the two fingers as they are equal, and the one that raises the eye also raises the eyelid to the appearance of the eye as they have recommended.
And properly adjust the threads of the plague's wound with a suture, and care for that which is within to become healthy again.
If you happen to have an abscess or wound, apply this remedy to the affected area, cover it with a cloth, and keep it clean.
If some weeping occurs on the eyelid that the eyes have turned into, then cover it with the remedy used for abscess; less stitching is needed where there are fewer natural folds.
Applying this form to cancers is second to the above method. And if you convert the eyelid and cut the figure that was previously second, and then apply doses of cantharides or very fine belladonna under the same latitude as the eyelid and longitude as the longitude of the spathe. And if you have already closed the ends of some parts, where the threads are.
Add subtleity to the remedy used for the abscess, and tighten the cantharides of some parts with a strict grip, and leave it there for several days, so that the thread may rot and be rejected and become rotten within it if it meets with moisture.
If it is too late, cut the thread of the bile, and properly care for the wound that has been made.
When closed, the eyelid is raised and the ears do not prickle.
And this is the form of dough that you make after following this form: and had the quantity of the longitude and latitude neither more nor less than the minimum.
Chapter XII.
Of elevating prickles in the ear when the ear is hard.
When the ears are not natural, hard and sharp and prickly, you perform the operation on them as you grasp it with a subtle grip and place it on a subtle cedar of leon, and accordingly adjust the ends of it and the noses that come out in a subtle manner. And is the longitude of the fingers of a certain quantity of a palm.
And then you make another subtle finger on the side, and smooth out the ends of that if you want.
And then place the thigh on the other side, and it is proper for the sole of the foot because your work is declared, four is a subtle and small operation.
When the needle is introduced into the ear, adjust the one that needs the screw, and make it penetrate deeply into the eyelid forcefully until it exits that part of the natural pelvis.
And pull the pelvis inside out and insert that one in adjustment, and they can be either one or two or three, but not more.
And pull your needle out that which is outside the eyelid and adjusted in the artificial pelvis, and it should be inside the natural one.
If you are not adjusted in the eyelid and the pelvis is outside, adjust the pelvis in the parts that are left of the one you have composed for the trauma, within which the pelvis is adjusted.
And see if that is the case with the hinge, take four points where you inserted the needles and the one that was composed for the trauma, and close it and tighten the hinge, and leave it for two or three days, within which the pelvis adheres to the right place and stays on the good flesh.
And if it is not quickly adjusted, take a long pelvis of the natural ones and elevate it on that, or that which lies within which is along the space, and you should see if it is adjusted properly.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the text you provided is not in a
The cure to remove what is in the eyelid.
When the eye becomes inflamed, and there is contraction of the eyelid when it is pressed upon, either on the left or right side, due to poor consolidation of pus or separation or cauterization, and this is called rheumatic, and it may be natural or accidental, and it is made by consolidation of pus or separation or cauterization, or for the appearance of being so.
May the manicure of the operation in it be that you force that consolidation and separate the lips of it, and place on it as you are between those an engine of cloth of li, and tie those when they are healed.
And not need that you use of cure of it from the causes which dry them up, constrict; rather if you make it return to cauterization of pus bad that no time without fire has.
Use in those of causes which soften it as is fenugreek, and embrocade it with water in which are coits alta and semen of li, or enguent dyaquilon, the which is liquefayt am alcu of the oils, and submerge those in that meca, and cure that.
The first source sentence translates to: "The treasury of your cure is that you pierce as many parts as are not solidified according to the form that follows at the beginning.
This operation, which has been described, is none other than a correction of the healing process that does not return the location to its original state after the fire.
Quando dolor de juncturas son faytas per humors fregas les
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
This alexander is made on the eyelid, which is truly an alexander; and it is either natural or accidental.
When an accident occurs due to plague, a cut, or cauterization, or by other means.
The method of the operation for the patient is that you grasp a loop in which it makes double, and fix it in the flesh, and that the skin passes from the inner canthus of one side to the outer canthus of the other, passing through that filum through the extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the skin to the parts where it is narrow and cut it with the loop, and insert it into the wound as wide as possible. Then return the figure of the eyelid to its former shape, if possible; and if not, grasp the ray and fix it in that position, and convert that part of the eyelid, and close the two fissures at the edge of the eyelid on the other side.
And the extremities of the two fissures of the two angles of the wound, which you have made within which they come together, and that angle is within which when they gather together this figure of theirs.
And this figure is Greek: the lamp.
Then leave the skin for that quantity which is the width of the lens on the other side of the eye, so that it covers the eyelid.
When the separated parts are adjusted and tied with thread, and the heated parts are cared for as has been said about the softening medicines and the calks that have entered the body, then...
If the cauterization is done through a fissure or suture or burn, then you should know that you should make a flat cut on the eyelids according to what has been said before. And separate the calk between the two lips as has been said.
In the sum of the speech of the treatment of cauterization when it is removed or placed, that runs in the operation, according to what has been prepared of the form of cauterization, and that is in the form of various motions.
And the artificer always prepares engins in every hand that is possible to enter when it is returned to the natural figure or part of it, and that mouth according to what is convenient for the operation and the instruments in the greater dispositions.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to certain men who have their eyelid firmly attached to the lower eyelid of the eye, and it is forbidden to move it or perform its natural functions, then you should enter the extraction of the eyelid from where it is attached, and lift it upwards, or extend it outwards.
And if you enter the adhesion of the subtle substances, which is not of sharpness, but rather of softness, and has a small point so that the thigh does not become worried about the operation, and remain the substance that does not disfigure the hollow am the acuity of the eye.
And if your incision is that it excoriates that adhesion with ease, then it is returned to its original form after the eyelid has been returned to its natural position and the entire adhesion has been healed.
And if you put in the eye salty water that you wash; or distill in it dissolved in the water.
And if you separate the eyelid from the eye and place on the eyelid a calgua of li, and infuse in the album of huou, and the third day use for consolidative causes that the eyelid is healed.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided text is not in a language
The translation of "De inscizio de ungla e de eminencia de carn dels lacrimals" is not directly possible without additional context, as it seems to be a Latin phrase or a title
The translation of "Sapias que ungla es segon dos manieyras, quar o es nervosa, e es semblant a ciphac dur subtil; o es no-nervosa, semblant a humiditat blanca congilada, la qual quan ferr la toca, o es forsat aquela prendre am onci, es abscindida e le onci no es ficat en lu." is:
The following text is a medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. I will try to guess what the text means and translate it line by line into English:
When the worker's hands are in the center of the wound of the patient, and they work on the edges of the wound, and lift the eyelid above the doctor's eye, and close the mouth over the tip of the needle, and extend it to the parts below. And take an eyelet and enter it into that one of the horse's leg or the donkey's leg or the mare's leg, or a similar part, or a small bone, or double the end of the needle little by little and put it in the socket of the eyelet, and pull it out with the eyelet; and extend it to the parts below, and remove the bone that is stuck in the eyelet which causes the pupil to tear. And do you follow that with the eyelet into the leg under the belly of the patient.
And you insert the Roman's hand into the socket of the lacrimal bone under the subtle or small forfices, and cut the cartilage of the lacrimal bone naturally so that when inserted, it does not cause continuous flow of lumps.
When someone feels pain on the sole of their foot or in the heel, as has been said, and it is believed that this is the form of this disease, then it is appropriate to make points on the surface of the foot with a pointed cautery.
And make sure that you do not touch the corneal layer and that it goes through the rupture, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then apply the incision with a small amount of salt or herbs, and let it enter on the other day; and care for that as soon as it is healthy.
And if the pain does not become nervous and you cannot insert the needle or it is not located in that part, then this type of pain is cured by medicine and is healed as recommended in the division.
And if you want to make the incision, open the thigh and insert the needle under the sole of the foot according to this form. with subtlety. And if it happens that the pain is relieved and concealed and enters into this rash, then you distill from your ora in the thigh of herbs or salt or salted water, and let it enter into the other day.
E aprop itera sobre aquela la operacio entro que sia remaugut tot aquo que es de lu, sino que·l contrari apostema caut sia en le huel, quar lahoras tu leyssa aquela, e cura al comensament la apostema entro que sia sanat.
If you repeat your operation on that part that is healthy, it will become healthier.
If the secretion of the lacrimal gland is very excessive, it should be suspended for a while; and make a small incision on that part, and do not leave the incision open so that no tears flow from it.
And if you distill the secretion of the lacrimal gland and apply it inside when it is healthy, it will become healthier.
Chapter 17.
Of incisions made on aloe and of the water that is produced from the adjusted flesh of the thigh.
Sometimes in the thighs of alces, flesh is produced that is like milk, and it is placed under the pupil or over the eyelids, and the eyes are closed tightly and the eyelids are assembled as close to the edge of the balaustra as possible.
The operation on that part is that the thigh remains in its place; and you operate on the wounds of that and close all the flesh that is convenient for it, and use a forceps or a pair of tweezers; and make an incision in the flesh at the beginning when everything is finished inside, and keep the thigh that does not affect this from your operation.
And if your incision is not at the location where the surgeon made it in the umbilicus, or if it is too large, then use small forceps to cut it according to the shape of the patient's body in this case.
When the wound is closed and filled with the flesh, then fill the hole with salt threads, or pour on its fine powder, which resembles the dust of corrosive medicines, and close it over the hollow of the thigh bone as soon as it is ensured that there will be no postoperative inflammation.
And if the doctor suspects that there is gout and applies cauterization, and fears postoperative inflammation, then open the hole and treat the inflammation as this one that yields to the inflammation, and repeat it over the area during the operation when it is cured, and seemingly make in the flesh that happens in the hollow of this special.
But may I remind you that the entire cure of the hollow of the thigh by natural or accidental means is iron, and do not leave your hand in any of these operations until you see that this member is suffering from this operation.
The text you provided is a medieval medical treatise written in a language
1. "De collectione de sabel en le huel" translates to "Of collection of silk in the
2. "Sabel so venas rogas las quals son testudas sobre le huel e prohibeysso al vesement la sua operacio" translates to "The silk vessels that are covered with the skin on the thigh and prohibit the operation of the vein, and dilate the thigh over days.
Thus, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the wound is in the quality of being strong or not another malady, and then you join that wound.
Is it that you command the patient to lift the affected part towards the head, and suspend those veins as close as possible to the opposite side of your caution; and this one should be of subtle duplication according to this form:
or so doses gradually in another part according to this form:
And then you firmly join those veins to the most subtle parts, to the subtlety, and avoid the sanction hour at that hour, until you see those veins being bettered by the wound and being refreshed.
And keep in mind that you do not open the wound in the extremities of the skin; and if your operation is done in the morning, and you must keep fast in your operation, so that those veins are not inserted.
And when you have finished, you distill in the wound at the top or at the bottom, and let it be sharp and bright to make the wound bettered and refreshed that is bettered by the wound.
If it is not possible for you to collect all of this at once in that time, and you apply all of it to the part where the pain is located, and you leave it for several days after the pain has subsided and after ensuring that there is no risk of gangrene.
And repeat this over the second hand when it becomes healthy.
This is the form of the forceps:
Chapter XIX.
Of reducing hernias to the nose.
When you treat hernias with cauterization or acute medicine, and it does not heal immediately after the narration of the pain, do not engage in it but rather cover the gangrene with the maturity of the part, and remove all the moisture that is in it, and put it inside when you discover the bone.
And when you discover the bone and sometimes in its corruption or blackening, you should cut it with a instrument of this kind:
It is made of sharp iron, and it is made to be hammered, and it is shaped like the following:
When you pause that over the rotten part of the bone, and then roll it between your fingers, and press your thumb on it little by little as you know that this carrupo is rash,
If it has been some time, and then restore the area with the cause of desiccating and stiffening.
If the wound is well-consolidated and healed with good flesh and the body of Rome in 40 days, and it does not reoccur or become infected, you will know that it is cured.
However, you should not be in that area unless you can reduce the fissure to the shape of a needle, and then follow this method: and it will be a second time that you discover another bone or another medical instrument, and when you discover them, you should hold on to this form:
If it is the triangular extraction of the bone, and it should be the first one extracted from the extremity as many times as possible.
And place that on the bone, and it is the lacrimal; and along your finger with a small piece of hazelnut, and then rotate your finger while it enters all the bone, and that will feel the cavity because the wound is about to close as soon as you touch it.
So you will restore the place with medical dried plasters as you have experienced.
When the flesh and bone are enduring pain, then return the matter that has infiltrated the outer parts to their original position, therefore place your hand on the thigh.
Chapter 20.
Of reducing the prominence of the heel.
When the heel is prominent in its entirety and does not cause harm or diminution in walking, then you should loosen the thigh bandage, and appropriately follow it, and place your hand on the scarification of the chest, and apply a liniment made of acatra, aloe, and sarcocolla, and tighten the wrap around the heel with powders.
And the powder for the hands is what you take from the four corners of the leopard's feet, and each corner is doubled into four parts; and make of those.
And place those one on top of the other according to the amount that the heel requires. And tighten those with a hard wrap that is strictly tight; and repeat the wounds on the scarification; and remove the wraps and stretch the heel daily and nightly.
When the ligament is softened, you should make sure that it is straight.
And then remove the linen that was on the day before and the night before as they have said.
And if the wound has already been reduced, then so be it, and otherwise, apply plaster to the powders and the stricture and the openings that are healthy.
Chapter 21.
Of the significance of the superior eyelid skin.
When there is an interruption in the superior eyelid skin, and it becomes prominent and protrudes outside the eyelids as a gra of rasim, and its shape is distorted, and you wish to insert it, then do so according to what has been recommended, which is to enter the agula at the edge of the uvea from the side where it is located further away, and place another agula at the double part of the lacrimal, and make it penetrate and lay the first agula according to its disposition; and then inscribe the location of the double agula and lift that part of the uvea into the circuit of the agula, and strengthen that motion.
When you have removed the belt and placed it on the smooth woolen album, enter when the thread comes out of the grape vine.
And take care of the wound with this that it is comfortable for you when the plague is cured.
Some veins are added to the whole part of the dress that is in the circle of the drape around the wound, and it is perforated by a small puncture that comes to the preon of the wound, and runs through the subcutaneous tissue, and goes down the wound and enters as much as possible.
And stretch as much as it is cured.
Chapter 22.
Of the cure of gout.
This disease called gout is not only painful, but also the one that is adjusted in the wound like water from a fountain and not that one.
The hand of the worker in this is that you press the wound on the cloth covered with a blanket and dry, and hold the head so that it does not enter into the parts that you see coming out of the gout, and it should be dry and not run down, and the lamp should remain lit, and the wound would see its causes as they were.
If it does not go down below, you know that it is wet.
If the descent to the anus is not prepared, as they have said, you must make the thighs cross over the patient's shoulders and place your hand on a subtle piece of cloth and then press it down on the ciliary border of a small part of the continuity of the conjunctiva on the cornea of the eyeball (within the location seen), within which the anus may be forgotten.
And if it is forgotten, then you should distill the water in the tail of the plant where you have mixed honey or water in which you have already built yogurt and honey.
And if it is cured, then it is appropriate to consider other causes within which it may be healthy.
Capitulum.xxii.
Of the cure of the water descending from the tail.
They have already said the specifics of the water in the division and what is convenient to declare, you must then follow that for the health.
You should make sure that you cross the thighs over the patient's shoulders on a chair and hold the tail of the plant with the strong string.
And a proportionate pause is made near the eyelid of the eye that is the opposite side of the one with the pain, if the one with the pain is on the left side; or on the right side, if the pain is on the right side.
And hold your hand firmly on the opposite eyelid, if the pain is on the left side; or on the right side, if the pain is on the right side.
And make a proportionate pause at the extremity of the hand near the crown, over the largest part of the ray in the album of the eyelid, and hold your hand firmly and rotate it to see if it is correct.
And insert your hand into the album of the eyelid and feel that the hand has already penetrated due to the pain.
And make sure that the size of the glove of the hand is in proportion to the space that is inside the pupil from the end of the nictitating membrane to the corner of the eye, and the cornea of the eyelid; then you will see that the pupil is in the vision of the eye through the clarity of the cornea.
When you have found the place where the poison is located, and then you cut down one of the veins that leads to it, and if the poison comes out, then quickly close the wound with your hand over the place where the poison is coming out, and apply pressure.
If you have repaired a little; then if the poison comes out, then quickly stop the other vein that is not yet bleeding.
When you have stopped bleeding and it does not come out, then quickly remove the bandage as much as possible, and wash your hands with clear salt water from a glass of gemstone, and wash the wound with rosewater or almond oil and albuminous ointment; and leave the wound open or stop the bleeding with a piece of cloth infused in rosewater or almond oil.
We know that those who are from our time have stopped over that which was made with albuminous ointment.
And if you do not obey my advice to close the wound with the intramarginal membrane for its hardness — which is the reason why many men have hard hands — then I advise you to take the saliva of the mouthwash that is called alberid of the qual this is the form:
When you have drilled that joint, do not stop at the end of your tool, and if you do not succeed in passing it through, you will have to remove it and try again.
And enter the second part as they have said.
You must prepare the compliment of your work, as it should be in a dark place where the patient sleeps, lying on his back with his head down, and should be prohibited for all movements.
And pause the gout in its natural state so that it is sanitized, and do not cause any pain to the patient's side or front.
And let the limb follow its own disposition on the third day.
And do not neglect that in that dark place and expel the seen foul smell, and make the patient see some causes, and return the limb on the seventh day.
And do not think that you are doing gout in the time of the curers or too much in the infusion. They have thought that you take gout because the water falls on it with great and violent regard.
If you have an attack of apoplexy, cover the affected area with a cloth, and on the seventh day, correct this one that causes the apoplexy.
Do you know the face of the patient and place your hand over his mouth for the one who regulates his breathing, which is done for several days, it exists in the darkest part.
And gradually your voice becomes weaker and you talk about its causes.
You know that in alchemy there is no excuse for the disciple of vision who sees some visions, and you should be careful about the operation.
It has already happened to us of those who are in the art, and the artist said that he makes fire in the Ayrac magdaam by perforating the one that succeeds the water.
However, you have not seen it in our land that has perfected this, nor has it been read in the art of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the species of Ayrac magdaam that are over those that do not know them:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.

Of the cure of the flesh nothing in the nose.
When in the nose there are different nails adjusted of which one is a certain cause that is assembled to scorpio of motz feet, or to polyp eyes; and this disease is called polypus in similarity to that eye represented. And of the flesh there is cancer, black, and of the flesh that is not of black color; and of the flesh there is that which is not of leon color.
Therefore in this that is in these flesh not leon color, cover that you make the cure between your hands and place at the sun, and hang the nails of it, and pick up the tip of it in those flesh. And if you extract that from the parts deformed, and if you inscribe that which you have understood of those spatums agut subtle of one part inside which you know that all the flesh is already laid; that if Roman of it by that cause of the which the abscisio is possible, then you do to that with an of the subtle instruments by facilat entro que de lu romangua denguna causa. If the lord or lady has an injury or accident to the thumb, then stop there with that which covers it; if it is one of the malignant boils, then cut and cauterize it within where it is abscessed and leave the cavities whole.
When the patient's nostril is near the incision, it should be cleansed with warm water and saliva. If the nose is cleaned and moisture enters the mouth, you will know that it has healed.
If moisture does not enter the mouth, you will know that nothing is cut in the flesh of the nose that has not been excised.
Therefore, if there is any swelling in the part where it was cut, cleanse it with warm water and soap, and pause between each amount of the same or different cause that may be possible to enter the mouth and exit through another extremity of the fenestra in the nose.
And if this were to happen, that the sweet odor would enter the nostrils when it passes through the nasal canals, and be placed over the goldbulb, which many children see as an attractive appearance for this action in school, and is a cause that someone may want to do.
And pause the two extremities of the fenestra, one that exits over the nose and the other that penetrates in the nose, and apply compression of the flesh to the nostrils that are in the fenestra, and know that the flesh has entered when you see that the flesh is in the nostrils.
When you remove the bile, and place it on the nose for the extraction of a gallbladder, and do this for three days or more until the entire gallbladder has been removed that is causing the pain.
When you have reached the end of the cause, place a catheter in the nose for the following days until it is healed.
If you need more information about treatment, use that.
This is the form of the instrument used by the barber to clean the face, which consists of essential oils and medicines in the nose.
Use silver or gold, which looks like a small lantern with a small flame, and the metal looks similar to it.
If you want, make a catheter closed as a cane, and the catheter of the instrument used by the barber to clean the face is flat and open; in which you hold it with your hand when you scratch in the oil or water that you want from the secretions and from the causes.

If the circumcision is delayed until it is large, consider if it is laparoscopic, hard, of dark color and few sensations, do not touch that with a sword that is a craniotomy; four movements are made to that which is circumcised this aposteme therefore by the great malice over that which that had.
If the aposteme is of lion's touch and not of dark color, and sometimes if the circumcision is possible in all that, then you evacuate the thigh and circumcise that senes fear, and cure the location as much as possible that exsique and return to enter when it is healthy.
Chapter 26.
Of the suture of the nose and of the lips and of the eyebrow when the continuity is dissolved by plague or seemingly.
You know that when you solve the continuity in one of these cartilages, few confidence is found in that operation but in other men.
Thus, when you come to any cause of those, which you consider if it is caused by fresh cold, and you adjust the edges of the wound with suture, and you properly care for that part which is cured.
If the edges of the suture are already separated, and every part is healthy, you need to cover each part of its appearance inside that it does not become infected. And you adjust the edges of the suture and tighten them, and over them sprinkle sanctifying powder of dragon's blood and incense, and place a finger on the powder for a day or for another consolidating powder, and press that lip for two days or three, and properly change that and replace the powder and press that inside that wounds are separated, and care for it so that it becomes healthy.
The manicure of the suture is that you add the edge of continuity or as recommended in the suture of the belly, or add the edge of continuity as you and know it.
I apologize, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The text you provided
The translation of the first line is: "From the extraction of those causes that enter the lips of the teeth in the parts of the gums.
When visible blisters appear on the lips of certain men in the areas of their lower lips, which resemble hardened nails, and some are smaller and others are larger.
Thus, if you convert the lips and fingers of each of those hard parts, and then fill the space with water up to the point where it is tightly closed, and then wash it with cold water and treat the area with something astringent, within which it is sore, then it will become healthy.
Capitulum .xxviii.
Of the incision made on the adjusted flesh in the gums.
Great gauze is needed over the adjusted flesh of the gum which the old bandage was made of, and it is necessary to suspend that or have it on your hand with the needles inserted in its place and allow the sutures to run or the stitches.
And then pause over the tightened part or another starchy or exfoliating powder.
And if that flesh returns, make incisions secondarily and treat it with cauterization, and then make sure the cauterization does not return.
Capitulum .xxix.
Of the reason for toothache.
When the surface of the teeth of the joints and the gums, as well as the spaces between them, are rough and harsh, and some are dark and are called citrins or verdigris within the gum due to its corruption, and some are the teeth that have been cut.
And then cover the thighs with your hands and place the head of the patient on your knees, and remove the teeth that have those rough and harsh surfaces and causes them to seem like they are made of sand, and it is due to the blackness and citrinita and the others that are deformed.
If you are left with this, then so be it; and if not, you should repeat the reasoning on those other days and the next and the third until you come to the statement that you want.
And you know that the teeth have required various cuts of different shapes and figures, which are prepared for your operation. And for so that the razors can cut the tooth of the joint and not from the other side of the teeth, and these types of razors are those that you have prepared in advance, which will be used to cut as many as possible.
The text you provided is not in the language of medieval medical
1. "Capitol .xxx." - This line appears to be a date or a reference to a specific location
2. "Cove que tu cures la dent de la sua dolor am tot engen e tardes en tota eradicacio de lu, quar no es denguna causa que suplisqua la veguada de lu quan es eradicada, quar es sustancia sublima entro que es excusacio en la eradicacio de lu." - This line appears to be a medical advice or instruction on how to remove a tooth. It suggests that the tooth removal should be done with great care and thoroughness, as there may not be a specific cause for the pain, and the substance within the tooth may need to be removed during the extraction process.
3. "Mays cove quan le malaute es forsat aquela dent eradicar, que fermament deves tu sia certificat quala es la dent dolent, quar motas veguadas la dolor descep le malaute e cuga que sia en dent sana, e tu eradicas aquela e aprop la dolor no cessa entro que la dent malauta e dolent sia eradicada, quar nos ja havem vist aquo per operacio dels barbies." - This line appears to be a continuation of the previous advice, emphasizing the importance of properly identifying the painful tooth and ensuring that it is not part of a healthy tooth before attempting to remove it. The text also mentions that the surgery has been performed on other parts of the body, suggesting that the medical practitioner has experience in such procedures.
Therefore, when you need to certify which tooth is painful and know that you can scrape in the circuit of the tooth as soon as it is sore in the quality that is in the dentin of the gingiva of the whole part, and accordingly make that am those teeth, or forfexes subtle al comensament petit a petit entro que aquela concucesquas.
Then pay attention to the large amounts of good speech or sharp pain, and place the head of the thighs between the fingers that you hold that do not hurt you, and then straighten the tooth in a maneuver that does not hurt you, nor in the larger pain that gives.
And therefore, if you do not forget, take one of those instruments, and place it there to facilitate and exert force on the tooth that is made at the beginning.
If the tooth is swollen or burned, know that you can compress that trauc and stretch that am to the end of the thin part because it may be swollen at the time of your constraint over those teeth.
When you carefully perform scraping on the circumference of the entire gum and keep your strength so that it does not weaken or tear the tissue, and then return to the buttocks for the pain that is greater than the first one.
And keep in mind that those who perform such things as barbers without knowledge or audacity in their eradication do not administer what has been recommended; four methods are used to bring about the appearance of large men with difficult-to-treat pus that are not trinqued, and their faces are improved completely, or some of those, or that you extract that part from the mandible as witnesses have testified.
And the eradication of the pain is washed with water or vinegar.
If there is any flow of blood, as witnesses have testified, then you should cut off a small amount of bark and rub it over the wound, and if that does not stop the bleeding, cauterize.
The form of the forceps and their subtlety are such that the tooth begins with a long exit, a thin handle, and a large one, so that they do not bend when used to operate on those parts.
And are they as thick as the handle when entering that when it is stretched, it is not bent, it is thin.
And are they fissures of Indian iron fissures of the right exit, and in the exits of those there are teeth of the kind that some are inserted into others and stretched by a strong descent force, and some are watched over the exits of those are the form of the beak of an ape which has the name ciconia, it is strong, and they are of strong constraint.
Capitol, Book XXXI.
Of the removal of teeth and the extraction of bones from the trapped jaws.
When the removal of the tooth that is trapped by Roman law, you should place your hand over the edge of the area to border it for one or two hours until that location is softened; and then enter with your fingers or use forceps the exits of those which are assembled at the beak of an ape called ciconia or guanta, the form of the forceps:
When the pain is caused by the external factors of the body, it is similar to the symptoms of the limbs or the skin.
If you do not follow my instructions and use these forceps or pliers, you risk cutting the skin and destroying the entire flesh, as this is called the instrument that has been named by its creator. This is the small lever of this form:
If it is a thin end that is thick and not rounded.
Therefore, if the skin is forgotten, it is; and otherwise, help me with these other instruments of which these are the forms: the first instrument has a triangular external shape in which there is any thick part.
The second instrument's form is that it is triangular and has a thin external end.
And now I have helped you with this instrument, which has two ramps, one of which is the form that follows. And I will advise you with other instruments that you need in the removal of teeth. This is the form of this instrument, which is similar to one large, and this is the form:
When the thickest and shortest corner of the triangle is a bulge or shortening, and it is not triturated by itself, it should be treated with caution.
And another thing to know is that these teeth are different from the others in their appearance.
The artificer is skilled and subtle in his craft, but he fails because he does not know what the operation means and the different diseases; four are of the diseases for which the ancients did not have or use any specific instrument, due to their varied forms.
If the bone of the jaw or any other bone in the mouth is triturated, or if it is filled, then it should be treated with care in that place as much as possible, using the appropriate instruments and forceps that have been mentioned in the extraction of teeth, and this is the way:
And if there is any small bulge little by little, and it is held or kept in the mouth so that it does not escape or leak through, and all the bone is restored to its original state; and then the place is treated with appropriate medications as much as possible.
When there is a small hole in the bone, you should recognize that of that hole and its cause, and cure it within that which is healthy.
Capitol, Chapter 32.
The cure of the prominent teeth over the others.
When the prominent teeth do not follow the natural course of the body in that form, and especially when it is in women and especially in the elderly, then you should consider: if the tooth is nothing else but another tooth, and there is no possibility of cutting or applying a linament to it, then you should treat that one. But if it is not annexed to another tooth, then you should insert this one into this instrument of which this is the form; and it seems like a morsel of pork, and is made of Indian iron of sharp extrinsic ague.
And is your insertion at the place where you insert this one for many days due to the hardness of the tooth, and that it is not another tooth.
And if the prominent tooth is expelled from its socket, then you should line it with the iron of India of which this is the form.
This sentence seems to be discussing the use of Indian steel in making points for treating joint pain caused by gout. The points are made with a lima (a type of needle or point) that is similar in size to the small, round agujas ( Needles) used for gout treatment. The dent (tooth) is mentioned, which could refer to a tooth-like structure used for making points or a reference to the pain caused by gout. The sentence suggests that the Indian steel is suitable for making these points due to its ease of use and effectiveness in treating gout. This sentence seems to be discussing the use of a razor on the affected area and the importance of using it correctly. The "lineys" could refer to the lines or edges of the razor, while "ratz" could mean to
This sentence seems to be discussing the use of a razor on the affected area and the importance of using it correctly. The "dent" could refer to the tooth-like structure used for making points, and "lengua" could mean "tongue." The sentence suggests that if a part of the tooth is broken and the language (tongue) is affected, it is important to cover that area with a linen cloth to prevent the aspirated (or suctioned) part from being engulfed and causing further damage. The sentence also mentions that the tongue should be plumped (or swollen) and the language (tongue) should not descend or become corrupted.
This sentence seems to be a legal or official statement, possibly a law or reg
When restoring damaged teeth, it is necessary to use gold or silver.
When teeth are damaged by impact or pressure, and the jaw cannot bear it, and you have treated that with medicinal steel, but it did not work, then use gold instead of silver, as silver turns green and stays put for a while, but gold does not change color and does not stay in place for long.
And it is the gold that is used according to the amount that enters between the teeth; and the form of the forceps is that you grasp the gold and hold twice as much between the healthy teeth, and gradually increase the tortuosity of the gold between the damaged teeth, or if it's a single one, enter that the tissue goes to the healthy tooth of the other side. And repeat the process within the area you started, and tighten your hand on the gold that is easy to hold and know that it is not damaged.
And your tight grip on the gold requires you to hold the teeth that do not escape.
When extracting the excessive extramittents from the urethra using forceps or tweezers, and adding them to any location as needed, and converting those and the hidden ones between the healthy tooth and the malformed tooth, so as not to cause injury to the tongue. And you should apply that solution as the Romans used to do.
If it is slippery or breaks, apply that or those on another urethra in that manner for the entire time.
This is the form of the teeth and the figure of the rectification of healthy teeth and malformed teeth, as many times as these are applied:
And when you return a tooth or teeth to their proper place in those locations, and they grow back as advised, and become stronger.
And this is done only by the artificer and the savior.
And some bones are suitable for the bones of cows, and they are made in the form of teeth, and placed in a location where the tooth deficit is, and are strengthened as advised, and remain and serve for a long time.

If the patient experiences an intestinal obstruction, stop at the location where it was made; if the intestine is expelled, then make points on the area with a pointed cautery that corresponds to the pain. And this treatment is effective for other causes if it is healed.
Chapter 35.
In the extraction of gallstones, the tongue is left alone.
Some swollen things happen to the tongue, leaving it alone, which prevents the tongue from performing its natural operation; and it is greatly magnified when it is pulled out of the mouth.
And the operation in the tongue is that the mouth of the patient is pulled out sixteen inches in front of the soles and considers the aphthae.
And if you see the tongue in black or dark brown color and hard, which does not cause pain to the patient, do not touch that part with your hand.
And if it is swollen in white color and humid, then you can put the gauze on the tongue, and insert a small amount of ointment under it, and insert the other part; and if the intestine hurts during your operation, then you should stop immediately, which is the veterinary, until it becomes tight.
And return to your work after you have finished with the complement for the patient, after you have washed your hands and face; and care for that as part of the other cure when it is cured.
Capitol Chapter 36.
Of the extraction of Auricular hematoma and that which is nothing in the abdomen and of the others hematomas.
When you remove from the abdomen the gallbladder, which are glands that are together like cloth, which are deformed and are earlobes of Auricular hematomas, which when you cure them you are told in division that they are not cured, then you consider if the hematoma is hard, of black color, with little sensation, then do not touch that with iron.
And if it is of dark color and the skin is thick, then do not touch that with iron because of the flow of blood; rather lay that aside until it matures, and either you or she tears it off for herself.
And if it is of white color and the skin is thin, then that is what you should cover with a scarf.
The first source sentence to translate is:
When it is necessary to make points with silver or gold, and they are fine like thread.
Then, when you have prepared the language and it is shown to you, and you place your hand over it and look at that point, then you hold on to it and leave it in the arm, and take that out of the parts that you can. Another thing you take out of the tunics, and then incise with that instrument which is this form:
Another thing you take out of the tunics, and then incise with that instrument which is this form: It is assembled like forceps, but the extramitters of it are curved, so that the orifice of any of those is at the end of the other, which is sharp, and made of iron.
If this instrument is not at your disposal, then you incise that am spatum of which this is the form of it: And if one part is sharp, the other part is not.
And if you have incised with honey, incise the other according to this hand of incision, and then the incision closes the mouth of the urine.
If there is an increase in urine flow, it is necessary to drink plenty of water or herbal decoctions made from milk thistle or hawthorn and similar plants, as that increase in urine flow may be due to one of the causes of stitching. Then seek treatment for this within the scope of that increase in urine flow.
If there are any wounds on the outside of the thighs or another part of the body, and you have already described them in the description of the wounds of the thighs with a clear explanation, then proceed with the treatment of those wounds as you have already described in the description of the wounds of the thighs.
If you have already treated a woman with an ulcer that was located in the thigh, the ulcer had a dark color, very little sensitivity, the thigh wound had been closed, and the woman was breathing easily, and had been prohibited from eating and drinking, and had been pervaded by death for a day or two, then proceed with the treatment of that ulcer.
If the ulcer had already healed to such an extent that it had two layers of skin, then proceed with the treatment of that ulcer.
Therefore, I advise you to make the incision carefully and place yourself in one of the thighs, then pull out that one, and tear off a piece of it, and apply it to the other part of the wound, and close the mouth of the mouth, and chew on its tongue, and place the thigh in that position.
And then cut off a large piece of it, and do not run out of blood for a short time. Therefore, the cure of that woman is absolutely to drink enough water, and then you should continuously insert the incision into the wound for a long time, and the wound will eventually succeed in that location, which was previously injured.
Therefore, you must make the patient hot and cauterize the wound, and then do this additionally; and then walk around and do not leave any part of that prophecy unfinished.
Chapter 37.
Of the incision made when the wound is closed.
When cataract appears in the wound, and it is closed and long, then that part is cut perpendicularly; and if it is in the thick and round part, and that part is called a bubble.
When gout is cured and they say in the division, and it does not comfort your cure, and you see that the post is postponed and it has been done before but is now hidden, then you notice that the marks are round; and if it is to that length, and it is bloody, of a dark or black color, and not to the testicle, then you cover the incision of the testicle, where there is fear of the thigh.
When you see that second hand that I told you about the whiteness and length of which you make on the thigh and press the tongue of your patient with the instrument by which you process its form and insert it into the hole, and take that out and insert it into one of two instruments that I call in the inscription of two mouths.
And know that it is not inserted except in the way that is adjusted over the natural term, for if you insert it too much, you will lose the ability to speak.
And when you insert it, use the one that has been recommended in the inscription of two mouths, and care for that inside which is cured.
If the thigh was frightened by the insertion of the instrument, know that you use an edge in the cauterization of it, and the second hand of the cauterization is not only water-hot, and it is that you press the head of the thigh to the inside, and place the tongue of your patient on the instrument that I said, and take from the fire the water that I said in the cauterization, and make alive am this form:
When the surgical extraction of the cavity is placed in the one who has been placed under the medical care as the cavity of a cod, and the instrument of the medical care on the vagina, and the thigh is placed over the same side for which saliva or mucus from the mouth of that person is injected intrinsically by the medical care, so that no more of that same cause is placed on the groin of the one and that descends to that one.
And if you have your own medicine, and apply it over the uvula for the space of time that you see being degraded and sedated by the biting of the medical care.
And if you want, take a scalpel and envelop the foot over the extremity of the toe, and submerge the scalpel in the medicine, and insert the toe into the canula of the one that the scalpel adheres to in that canula, and make as many cuts as you can get from the cauterization of the gum, and leave that part for three days or four.
If you need to repeat the treatment, repeat it, and instead of cauterization, abstain in the circuit of the grape vine that is not cut at the border, and modify that same gout that is in the circuit of the medicine, and wash it with water, and treat it from the outside with the remedy for inflammation, and finish with guarguarisms within what is healthy.
This remedy for healing is placed because I engraved and put on for fear.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When the gullet is obstructed at the entrance of the mouth, and steam rises to the uvula, and the uvula is found to be blocked, then...
And if you proceed over those dry areas, and make sure not to cause this curacy at the end of the game, for too much will be adjusted in the apostem, and do not think that you are doing this, but rather you must declare the apostem of the cautery.
If you are not present with this instrument, then take a cane and close the hole of the cautery in the extraction of the mouth, so that the mouth of the patient is covered, for the closure of the cautery prevents the steam from burning the mouth.
And this curacy is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of extracting spines and of the other causes that adhere to the groin and of the other causes.
Dry areas are found adhered to the groin or to a spine of the eyes or to any other cause.
1. Then, when you have removed that which appears to be the cause of the pain, as it is visible, place your tongue on the tip of the instrument, so that you can declare to them that this is in the jaw.
When the medicine does not appear and is hidden in the purgative, it is possible that you vomit the intestine down because the food is rejected in the stomach; or that the purgative expels the intestine through the anus, mouth, or nose; or that a sponge from the sea, such as that used by Leon, is inserted into the intestine, and it is then emptied into the location where the intestine was previously located, from which the spincter muscles are removed. And you may catch a fish and swallow it whole, and it will be digested in the stomach; or you may drink water and swallow it in large amounts, and it will be absorbed in the stomach.
If the cause is not eliminated from those factors that have been mentioned, then you should use an instrument in this form to remove it.
And if it is large and resembles a small one, and during its extraction, the cavity of the intestine is in contact with your hand, it will be easier for you to enter it into the anus.
When the patient's head is elevated on pillows, and you guard that part of the head which is near the neck, so that it may be exposed to the gout that causes pain in the bones or spine, or that the physician has placed his hand on.
However, if the patient's leg is too large, because of its science of the location of the cause annexed and depressed below, and pulls his hand away from it with the instrument, as much as possible following the quantity that has been prepared within the time it is forgotten.
Chapter 39.
Of extracting the tumor annexed to the gallbladder.
When the physician has treated gout with medicine, and it does not give relief, consider the lower part of the leg of the patient at the sole, because you have compressed the tongue of the physician's instrument which he has recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see the tumor, extract it gently or with slight movements.
And if it is not possible for you to remove it, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the lower part of the leg of the patient, and place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and make as many incisions (as long as the tumor is still attached to the leg) and avoid damaging the entire leg with water.
And take a full glass of water, and work the mouth of the patient in that way, and wash the mouth with that; and do not neglect any cause and do not make the water too hot or too cold, as it may send the patient into shock.
And if it is not forgotten that they have recommended, smoke the thighs or the asafetida percume for the instrument that they have recommended in the sufumigation of the uvula.
And do this, in that way.
And it is another method of operation in sufumigation of that, because you take a flame in which the coal is charcoal and the flame is covered with a covering on the edge of the covering, and the instrument is passed through the extremity of the covering; and then stop the subfumigation; and place the thigh in the mouth at the end of the canula, and close the mouth so that the subfumigation is not forgotten until you know that the subfumigation has reached the sanctuary, as the sanctuary is most crucial.
If not, you should repeatedly apply subfumigation with the required substances, abstain from sexual activity, eat salty foods and drinks, and do not drink alcohol, and this regimen is necessary to be remembered.
This is the form of the instrument used to grasp the gallbladder when it is seen; and it resembles forceps several times, but there is no curve in it. The part of the instrument that grasps the gallbladder resembles the beak of a stork, which is sharp, in which there is an aspersion of lime, when some cause is found, that does not affect it.
Chapter 40.
In this chapter is the sum of the sermon in accusation of apostates and in section of theirs.
Apostates are special types of motions, of manual ones, according to what is remembered of them, from each in this free one.
And they are different in perforation and section by hand of the hands, of which one is for the specificity of apostates in them puts; and therefore because they understand from the humidity.
And the second hand is proper to the locations where the accidents of the body occur, for the accident in the head is another from the accident in the buttocks; and the accident in the fleshy part is another from the joint accident; and each of them is operated on.
And some of the wounds may be such that they are not perforated but rather matured by the soreness in those or on their complement.
And other wounds which are cuts when they are hard and are not matured by the complement, how are those wounds that are proper to joints, for when one joint pains, its cause is prolonged within what is most near to it in the circuit of it, and its limbs or nerves are corrupted, so that there is contraction of that member; or it is a wound of a principal member, and if you delay the perforation of it within its matured tissue of the principal member; or it is a buttock, so perforate it not-matured; and it does not cut that which is not digested, but that which is proper to the buttock, so that it does not cause the onset of the wound and elongates the parts of the fingers, and it is a fistula or a fistulous termination which is not healthy. When you know the time for the puncture of the gallbladder, and it is ripe.
If you know that the pain subsides with diarrhea and the fever ceases, and there is a decrease in the pulse and the acuity of the gallbladder pain, and the other symptoms.
And when you know that the puncture should be made at the point opposite the gallbladder and where the discharge comes from the curative action of the eminence.
And the puncture should be made at the end of the flesh or body, if the gallbladders are in the parts of the more or lesser toes, and in the place of the ligaments, of the tendons of the nerves, of the arteries; and, otherwise, in all places that do not reflect; and in those that do reflect, use a puncture according to that member.
When the gallbladder is in flesh, it is necessary to make the puncture at the point where it is confirmed that the digestion of the second complement has been confirmed; and if you make the puncture at that point, the corset of the poyl of the gallbladder and the sordid lip is prolonged, and much the labia of the endured gallbladder and the depth of the gallbladder.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When you make a small puncture, and in the large areas of the buttocks, make large and wide or narrow cuts according to the size of the buttocks.
And for the other parts of the buttocks where the tail is convoluted and fixed, when it is found that the tail is in distention and the tail is in terms that already exist, it is similar to that which happens in many dysentery and abscesses.
And of those that are not convoluted, have three angles; and of those that are not convoluted, it is similar to the figure of a fern of the thighs, similar to the thighs of the hamstrings.
And of those that have three angles, it is administered round and lunar section, similar to those.
Less of that which does not have the appearance of superficial thighs, if you make a puncture in that area with a superficial puncture or flat only.
When the thigh is large and has already been closed with a knot, if you make that puncture and do not touch the rest of the poultice at that time; if you take out a part from it, and place another part inside on the other day, and take out a larger part, and make more cuts according to the graduation as it is forgotten.
If the wound is from a gall, or a female pressure, or a small child, or an old man in decay, then the animal spirit moves to the exit of the disease, and much more so with the wound, and you should operate on it.
Take this precaution with great caution, and if you pierce through the tissue where you pierced these spikes, keep in mind that you may be exposing yourself to plagues. Consider then whether the plague of the spike is small or a flat section; if the spike is large, and the fissures of the piercing are sharp, then you should pay attention to every corner that comes into contact with the wound.
And if in the spike a part of the tendon or you have indented it in the circuit, keep in mind that you should complete it with a thin or thick strip of cloth, as you did when you stitched or sewed; and stretch it on the third day; and proceed to cure the one who covers the wound that is exposed to the disease.
If during your operation you happen to lose blood, you should immediately administer cold water and apply it to the areas where the wounds are located, and cover that with a cloth from the wounds that are visible.
If the blood flow persists, you should know that you are administering proper care and medication to the areas I have recommended in this free and separate part.
If it is during winter and the site of the hematoma is located in the nerves, you should know that you are covering the pulvis with vinegar and oil, and placing them over the areas.
And if it is during summer and the wounds are raw, you should know that you are placing dampened powder with water and oil on the wounds, and then removing the hematoma and cleaning and treating the wound with the care that is appropriate for the condition of the wound.
And it is necessary that you have knowledge of the care of wounds universally, but rather according to the type of wound, as I have already said about all wounds in the specific way of the cure of each one individually.
I apologize, but the provided text does not contain a valid source sentence
The translation of "De seccio de apostemas les quals veno en la codena del cap." is: "From the section of girdles that come into the codpiece of the head
The translation of "En la codena del cap petits apostemas, e so de specias de nodes les quals conteno tunicas que so a lor factz; e las specias de lor so motas." is: "In the head's girdles, there are small girdles made of certain nodes that contain tunics of their own; and the specifics of these are their movements.
The translation of "E de lor son pingas, e de aquelas so que conteno humiditat semblant a lima." is: "And theirs are pudends, and those that contain moisture resembling honey. The translation of "E de aquelas so las quals conteno humiditat semblant a pols, et asemblantz a lor; e de aquelas so que son lapideas, durs." is: "And those that contain moisture resembling polls, and are similar to them; and those that are hard, rigid.
The translation of "E en la seccio de totz, e en la extraccio de aquels no es temor, cum deves la exteccio de aquels no fa contrariat arceria." is: "And in the section of all, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, as you must the extraction of those not cause contraction of the arc.
When the operation is made in sections of those parts that you touch with the instrument of the form which is called an entrometer, and you know that it contains, then proceed.
If it is necessary to know the moisture, then cut that section in that part according to the length by cutting a surface according to this form:
Begin in the section of line .B. to line .G. Then when the moisture is evacuated, you remove that part where the humidity was found, and do not see any cause for all of it, then return several watches, if Roman from any cause.
And if you submerge the cot in Egyptian water, if it is present, and otherwise in water and salt; and fill that with the plague and leave it for another day, then you will corrode all that is Roman from that film.
And if you iterate over that cot with Egyptian water according to the instructions and then, if you ask for it, enter when you are confident that there are no Roman causes from that film; then cure the plague with enguent entered when it is healed.
If the gout is accompanied by fat nodes, then you should insert your finger into that following form: If there is no crotch form, then place your fingers between the two lips of the section and force your virtue in extracting the tunic that contains it.
If you have a hernia that contradicts, then you should know that I will first contact you primarily.
And seemingly the gout is covered by the section and care of the following that you have said; if the section of gout is put up, it is filled with very little and very little moisture.
And some people are crazy about these gouts that are in the head of those who are not humid; which causes is that you inserted your finger over an apostema on the face of a woman with a hard nose and distorted the apostema as a stone deaf, hard, white, which could not be drilled, and if that was for that person, it would cause pain.
When other accidents occur in the head, this is not the same capital, as in the cases of head injuries in children and you must consider the shape of the horns, but the section of all of these is superficial.
And pause the incision of those who have a lower part of their body that is affected by the disease to those parts that are lower.
And apply that which is appropriate for the treatment of that disease.
Chapter 42.
Of the section of scrofulas which occur in the chest.
Battes (mucles) that are visible in the chest and abdomen, and some also occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the chest, and the bats that are generated between them, and all scrofula of those is formed by its own membrane, and it appears like that in the nodules and papules of the head, and it appears like that as has been reported.
And the species of these scrofulas are bats, where some are hard, and of those that contain moisture, and of those that are malignant, which do not respond to treatment.
Therefore in that which you see as good disposition in the Tocament, of which the color of water which is manifested is similar to the color of the skin, and is not good for all parts, and is not attached to the nerves of the chest, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not pregnant, cover that you do not scratch that superficial dry part of the part until the part of the other side of the line of .G. within the line of .B., and burn that whole part, and extend both labia of the skin from one, or from the other if you need those, as has been said in the papules of the head, and extract a little at a time.
When caution is not exercised, veins or nerves may not be pierced.
If the wound is not firmly closed, that is, if it does not adapt to your thumb, or if it is quieted by you, and if it is already closed but you do not allow it to be closed in your operation, then when you pierce a vein or an artery and forbid it from being closed in your operation, stop the drilling of the glass vial or other powders that are causing the flow of smoke, stretch the wound, and remove what has been removed, and then close it again if it was previously closed by your thumb, and make the wound soft and begin to be pockmarked. When the swelling is separated.
Then return to your operation when the wound is closed.
And if you find any other small boils, then pierce those and clean them.
And if it is in the neck of the large vein, then do not pierce that boil from the same neck. When a woman's belly is greatly stretched and she feels pain in her abdomen, it is customary to call this condition childbirth.
And now complete the gap of the cut that you have already hidden in the Egyptian treasure chest, and take care of that.
If you insert the entire scrofula, it is necessary to adjust the lips of the wound and remove as much pus as possible without causing any additional damage.
If you find that there is additional damage due to the size of the swelling, understand how to insert the needle, draw out the thread and apply sutures as instructed.
If the swelling contains moisture, make a superficial perforation in that area where it appears to you as the location of maturation of the wound, and stop the perforation until the pus reaches the bottom of the chest, as they have said.
And apply sutures, cover the wound with something suitable and similar to those, so that it does not cause any damage to the tissue. When you see that the plague has already been cleansed, then treat that affected area with this natural remedy made from the flesh of the living creature that is healed.
Chapter 33.
About the section of the needle of the acupuncture accident in the gout.
Remove the old section with the needle in the acupuncture point, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done that.
And this is the inscription of the sermon of those.
Most men have not experienced this, but it is avoided the extraction of the needle, as for that it is not good for you to do all the veins and the greater parts of the thigh here.
Most who have had acupuncture in the mouth or gout or two ears, when the disease is not in the canal, it is avoided to remove the section of the needle to avoid the loss of that which is made by perfection.
Therefore, when you want to do this, that you inscribe the needle of three or four small circles of the needle, or more if they are close together, that the section is in ciphac, not in the cartilage, and this location is appropriate for the section, which is private of flesh and the vessels of sand from the sun are lean.
If the doctor is afraid, cover yourself with clothes that extend from the neck to the chest, and then stretch the clothing over the canal as it passes through, so as not to reveal any private parts.
And if the medicine has been inserted; and it is significant over the incision of the canal by the flap that is of that eyelid which is of the eye that is dislocated and for the abscess of the gout.
And the plague remains open for some time.
Then at the hour when the hole is made in that perforation, add some lips of the plague's belly, and that alone supports the cartilage.
And it is given medicines that make the flesh softer within which is healthy.
According to Albucasis, the sum of the speech that has been recommended is not only that you see that the abscess of those posts has opilated the thigh, and the thigh is coming to death, and the soul of the patient is being excised, and they will insert the epigastric per for the thigh to breathe over the place of the plague for some respiration, and it will be saved from death.
When it comes to treating an abscess that has been opened and the pus has been consumed from the infected wound; and the pus remains for three days; and therefore, I command the abscess to be treated in this manner, and cure will come within those three days.
Because of what you have seen in my practice, it is that a certain part of the lung's bronchus is inflamed and very painful in that area, and you were called for the treatment of the patient, and the wound was cleaned with clean water as it would be without the wound, and the abscess was discovered and the pus was removed from the affected area, and the wound was cleaned and the pus was removed from the affected area.
Therefore, you confessed that it had not yet infected the vein or inflamed the area, and the wind was from the abscess, and cured it within the time that the wound became healthy.
And do not be angry with the trade if it does not rupture in the vote, and return to the lord of your possessions within the proposed time.
And now I say that there is no fear in the section of the epilepsy.
The text you've provided appears to be a medieval medical treatise written
When an abscess occurs in the groin region, and it is called a groin hernia.
This hernia of the scrotum is a great aposteme after the color of the body, and it is called in women.
And it is second to two manieyras, whether it is natural or accidental.
And in the natural it is not an engen of curing.
And the accidental is second to two manieyras of which one seems like nodes grasses, and the other manieyra seems like aposteme which is made by nodecio of artery, and in that there is fear. And it does not come to assume that this is as hard as iron in that which is small. And you propose that and investigate that which is said, and if it seems like grasses nodes and not suspended in any vein, then you insert that eye as the nodes, and extract that part from where it comes from the belly and bursiclam; and otherwise, you scrutinize all the substance to be, and apply cure to the place from where it seems to be curing when it is sane.
Chapter 45.
When there is a section (cut) in the nodes (seeds).
The seeds have specific properties, and I have already mentioned all the properties of theirs in the division.
And you advise that you distinguish between nodes and exitus as if there were doubt about it.
Therefore, you say that exitus is heat and fever, and violent pains come in when the cold of saturation is removed from the superfluity; and it is filled with putrefaction, which ends the fever, the pain, and the heat.
Therefore, nodes are not heat or fever, and count that cipher leon is the one that is in the sac proper.
And then is the color of the body, and the beginning of it is like a cheese and is made as a vase, whether major or minor, and they are two species, four or five, and the fatty parts contain humor, and the colors of the humor are specifics, according to what you mentioned in the division.
Therefore, when you reach the treatment of nodes, that exhorts you to ask for that and inquire about it at the beginning, according to what is called intromes, which will come in its form in the capital that is appropriate for this.
When you are performing an examination of the hips and all the nodes, and when you take this instrument and insert it into that location which is moistened with water and touches the aposteme, and you rotate the instrument little by little as you know that the instrument has already penetrated the codena.
Then, the last of your measures is to measure the size of the aposteme, and then extract the instrument and consider that it is indeed in the form of the one you are using.
And if the moisture is forgotten, of whatever color it may be, you should cut it at the surface as I have said in the other apostes.
And if there is no moisture in the form of the instrument, you know that it is heavy.
And dry over it with a cut of not round form according to this form: As he taught you, and suspend the instrument with those pins, and clean the codena of all parts as easily as possible, and keep the belt or sack over it and extract that sain from the node.
If something breaks during the operation, it is not possible to extract that healthy part, and you should continue as before, and then you can extract it from the inside if there is no cause for concern in that part.
If something is found to have caused a problem, either too little or too much, the node will return to its previous state.
If you notice that something is causing a problem in any small part of the body, then mix some sharp, corrosive powders with the plague and strengthen the plague, and place your hand on the area that causes the inflammation, and treat that area with another remedy within the same curative.
If it is a large node, then you should cut off its lips and treat that area as follows:
If the pulsation is stronger on the opposite side, or not pulsating, then you should cut and humble the place where the gallbladder was removed that was broken and let it stay for two days or three until the plague ceases and the ebullition of the sanc returns; and then return to dissecting that which is causing the node.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided text is not in a language
Of the forms of sturment (stitching) necessary in section and perforation.
This sentence is discussing the different forms of incisions, which are of three kinds: the first being the largest and most severe, the second being moderate in size, and the third being the smallest.
The form of intromes is this:
The form of introducing small things is this:
These are forms of iron, of gold, of the extremities of branches, in order that the introduction may be easily made into the wounds.
These are the forms of the experienced ones, and they are noted as easy, and one of them is called bridging.
And there are three kinds, four of which are large, more and fewer.
The form of the experienced one is large, the form of it:
The form of the experienced one is more, the form of it:
The form of the experienced one is fewer, the form of it:
It is convenient that they are for those wounds, exits, fistulas, and abscesses, because they enter those of the bones and from other causes.
And these are returned, large, long, teeth, as great as the largest needles that are made of those which are cut from the shells, and they are pains of the lemon, or of the iron, or of the silver, and the best are when they are of the lemon.
When the experienced practitioners of black plums are considered that for those they should be opened as the fistulas in the cavity of which they are reflections, which are reflected as to their levitation as to those reflections.
There are three kinds, four of which are the longest, and of the others, and of the others, according to the quantity of the cavity of the fistula and the stricture of it.
The form of the great practitioner of plum is:

And of their worms or galls, and of three kinds.
And of those worms or galls there are three kinds with different curves.
And of their galls there are three kinds with three curves.
And all of these are necessary in their place.

This are the forms of the scalpels that are cut and scored on the nodes and the appendages, and there are three species, four of which are large, medium, and small.
Form of large scalpel:
The first line of the text is in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian
, Spanish, and French. Here's a possible translation:
When the external parts of those that are cut are sharp and the others are not, and are not paused in such a manner, but rather for the purpose of causing pain in the extraction of nodes, due to the fear of vein thrombosis or nerve damage, and for the sake of healing the thighs and restoring tranquility through a slight adjustment of the temperature, which reduces the inflammation of the appendix, it is done with the intention of causing pain.
These are the forms of almanac, and there are three species: large, medium, and small, as worms.
These are the symptoms of anger and their resemblance to alcohol.
And it is in the external point that there is a hidden cavity and in that corner of the fingers and toes, when you want, as you see.
The forms of spices, which are placed between the three parts of the body, and not the wounds, and there are three species: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of vinaigars used in those that have the flow of the sinus closed and there are three species: large, medium, and small; the forms of the vinegar:
These symptoms are of lemons, round and of a certain length, and they are subtle.
When these winds of illness are upon you, you must take great care, make many preparations, and act quickly in order to avoid serious harm, and remember that at your first sign of illness, it is best to seek medical attention.
Do not use these winds of illness in all parts of the body, and do not use them except in places that are not so sensitive, such as the hinges of the limbs and the buttocks, and the hinges of the breasts and the stomach and the eyes and the ears, and it seems like the hinges of the canine teeth.
Some wounds are caused by these instruments, which seem to be smaller than the teeth of a saw; for which reason, when the pain is relieved by lancing, or you must incise the vein or the artery, you must be careful.
Some wounds are round in this form:
Chapter 47.
Of the cure of the breasts of men who are assembled from women.
When some women's breasts are inflamed, it is necessary to comment on the fact that they begin to grow hair, and if they are also inflamed in women, and in those who have been castrated, it is called gynocele.
And if you want to apply this form, cut the skin along the line .B., up to the line .G., and remove all the hair, and apply the medicated ointment throughout, and adjust the lips of the wound according to the size of the wound, and cure it within that which is healthy.
If the breast is lower than the other and is softened by its size, as in women, it should be cut into two parts and placed side by side, in two sections resembling the moon, of which each must be contained in the other, according to the line that major contains the smaller section in this form of the line .B. and .G. And remove the skin that passes between the two lips of the wound and cleanse it, and care for what has been said about the sutures and powders that are necessary in the cure, according to what is healthy.
If you do not fill the incision of this disease that is caused by the inflammation of the thigh and by the flow of sinus, then it covers that the plague of the cut submerged in encounter corrosion and leaves that part which this corrosion is from the gray, and properly cares for that part which is healthy.
I apologize, but I am unable to provide a translation for "Capitol
This line seems to be discussing the aftercare of a surgical procedure involving the removal of a post (apostemas). The term "titillic" is not recognized in medical terminology,
This line suggests that the removed post (apostemas) is made of the species of scrophulas, which are hard and have a central vein (pel) that is removed. Scrophulas are not a recognized medical term, but it seems to be referring to some type of hard, fibrous tissue.
This line suggests that some of the removed post (apostemas) may contain moisture, and those that do are considered unstable and should be removed before the next menstrual cycle. The figure mentioned is not clear, but it seems to be referring to a specific part of the body or a specific medical condition. The phrase "cum es tot evacuat" means "when everything is evacuated," indicating that the entire process of removing the post should be completed before moving on to the next step.
This line suggests that after the cot (or part of the post) is removed, it should be cleaned and treated appropriately to prevent infection. The phrase "entro que sia sanat" means "if it becomes healthy," indicating that the treatment should continue until the area is fully healed.
This line suggests that if the post (apostema) is made of the species of nodes and scrophulas, then you should divide it as has been described in the section on scrophulas engulfing. The term "nodes" is not recognized in medical terminology, but it seems to be referring to some type of small growth or tumor.
If the plague is extended to such an extent that it causes pain, then you should administer the cautery in this manner as has been stated previously.
Chapter 49.
Of sections of gouts that occur by means of the artery or vein.
When the artery is torn and the cord is consolidated on which it is situated, then violent pains occur in the gout. And those who know that inflammation and gout are caused by the artery or vein: four, when the gout is due to the artery, it is lengthened at the top of the chest; and when you press on the gout with your fingers, you feel that it has a stridor.
And that which is due to the vein is reduced to the manifestation of the chest.
And if this gout is an error, and especially in the thighs, and in the shoulders, and in the chest, and in many parts of the body; and it is very large, so that its cure with iron is avoided, and that which is in the extramits or on the head, also avoids it.
When there is inflammation in the orifice of the urethra, it is cut in the pelvis along its length; and then the incision is made with a sharp point and the urethra is dilated, and the tunics are separated within the part that is exposed.
Place the cushion over that hole and make it penetrate into the other part, and stretch the urethra at the double in two places, which causes you to have difficulty in extracting the other urethras that are in the bladder.
And plug the space that is between two ligaments and let it enter until it reaches the entire part that is in it, and the aphonia is dissolved.
And administer the cure in which the pus is generated within it, and cure that which is convenient for it to come out when it is cured.
And if the abscess is caused by urethral division, then cover that you have with your hand at the abscess and its possible cure in the pelvis, and insert the plug in the place where you have placed your hand, and make it penetrate; and let it be in the double fold that you extract from the other urethra, and ligate the abscess with the ligament that you said to me in the ligament of the grape4 of the four parts of the fil that are at the extremities.
If you fear that the cord is being pulled out, then enter the other end of the cord at the same hole where the first end was inserted, and tighten the knot of the thread as much as possible.
When the abscess is located in the appropriate place on the body, and it is necessary to open it, you should insert the needle into the excess of the skin, and then remove the pus from it.
Then place your hand over the pouch that you have submerged in oil and water, and then administer the cure that is made with calx and extract to make it more effective.
The capitulum of the abscess that occurs due to twisting of nerves.
How do abscesses occur in the artery and vein, and it seems that abscesses occur in the nerves when they are struck or occur due to excessive work, and for similar reasons.
And it is the cause of the pain in the assistants' hands or toes, or in all places where joint pain occurs.
And the abscess is heavy, and it resembles the color of another body, and it is in the largest parts of its dispositions and when it is very angry, it seems to be stupefied by the thighs.
When there is no need to add another stitch in the chest, and by so doing, the knot is placed at the end of the wound, and it is tight enough not to cause any discomfort or pain.
Therefore, those who are in the joints do not need to be enveloped in iron, for if you press hard enough, it will relieve the contraction.
However, that which is in the head or forehead does not need to be sutured with a needle. However, if it is only a small stitch, you can use that and cut off the excess.
And if it is large, you can use that to suspend it, and remove the excess, and then take out that; and adjust the thread of the suture, and care for that inside when it is healed.
Capital.
Of the section of stitching that occurs on the lip that occurs on the abdomen.
Endeavor to remove the knots that are visible on the abdomen of those and in other parts of the chest of those which are called fungous for their likeness to those fungi, of which the subtlety is under the tip of the finger and the grossness is at the end; and already the lips of those are conversant, and it is of those that are small, and it is of those that are magnificent.
When you have seen one, and in the patient's belly there were two that were less like their fellows, and there was no difference between those white ones, not much.
And the lips of those were reversed and they were made to face each other, and moisture ran throughout that entire time.
Therefore you inserted those and tightened them on the other side of the foot, eighteen times on each. And the other you loosened.
And the operation in the insertion of them is that it is considered labor if the thigh is moist, and the color of the hernia is white, moist, of subtle reasons; you insert them with spatula, and they are in your presence of cauterization at the fire, four watches you must see the section of it be expelled without pain; and if you find the pain, cauterize that.
And if the thigh is cold and fearful, keep away from insertion with iron; rather, labor to find a recent point on it, and hold that hernia, the hand of which they have said; and let it be for two days.
And then adjust in the constriction of the string of the pulse; therefore, do not continue to tighten the pulse greatly, as it is separated and falls by itself.
If the member is large in size, there are causes of fear and pain in its incision, and especially in those that are in the belly.
Maybe you cut the largest part of the member, and then burn it so that it does not return.
And then care for it after it is healed from the plague.
And keep in mind that you do not cut the member that is of dark color, with few feelings, and of small size, as it is almost cancerous.
And when you come in remorse of this.
Capitol, liii.
Of the eminent cure of the navel.
Eminence of the navel is caused by motive causes; or by fissures of the liver that is over the belly, and it is taken from the intestine or hernia according to what happens in other ruptures; or by stenosis caused by vein or artery as it is said, or by narrowing of the intestine.
When there is a fissure in the chest and a hernia, the color of the hernia resembles the color of the heart; and the pain comes from different situations. If it is for the exit of the bowel, you place that point on the part where they have found it, with less violent diversity, and when you present that point to the wound, return it; and quickly he returns, and the hand is magnified, and the intestine is inserted.
If by cold, you are a lion and it is not hidden when you present your hand to the wound, nor is it tightened, nor is it crushed.
And if it is for the sinus, you present these sutures to the patient's eyes so that the aphrodisiac appears to decrease.
If it is for the flesh, you present a heavy, thick, and hard aphrodisiac that sticks to one quantity.
If it is for the ventricle, you touch the lion's lesion with your hand.
The operation in this is that you consider it labor if the umbilicus is for the sinus of the artery, or the vein, or for ventricular. You know that it is prohibited from the cure of the patient, because in that there is fear and poor knowledge as you were taught in the capital where I have mentioned the aphrodisiacs for the artery and the vein.
When the prominence of the umbilic is due to the belly or the cloth, you should cover it with something that commands the abdomen to hold the desired position and be stretched; and then, if possible, insert a tent in the circuit of the entire umbilicus, commanding it to be turned towards the inner side of your thighs over the desired part, and surround it with a spatula around the circuit of the umbilicus at the location you have indicated with the tent; and extend the handle of the suture to the parts of the patient's belly that are far apart; and then tie or cut the thread with the needle or the hook.
And then extend the handle of the suture over the thread and insert the desired one into that indication to hold the belly; and if you have not or has kept it with the thread, you should extract and pull the belly to the parts of the thighs from the abdomen.
And if you have shrunk the cloth, hold it with that hand; and insert the excess of it.
If it is contrary to your arc or vein, surround that point with your hand and return to your operation; and take two needles and put them in those two far points and insert two needles into the circuit of which you made around the suture at the location where the hooks penetrate, and stretch the suture on four parts over the needles.
If you wish, remove the beads and clean the area that is exposed to the extended flesh and falls on it; or insert it when it becomes subtle and comes into contact with the skin, and carefully cover that part of the flesh that extends over the wound that is presently healing.
If the eminence of the navel is of flesh or humidity, you cover that which you have cut with the intestine as we have said, and damage the sac or humidity, which affects it, and carefully cover that part of the flesh that covers and consolidates the place.
Chapter 33.
Of the cure of a hernia.
As we have said in division, of the nature of a hernia and in what manner it is treated by physicians, and that it is cured by them with iron because it is not ulcerated; and they have said that a hernia is generated by the procreation of the womb and carefulness in the cure of the hernia.
And they divide the ancients who some have seen hernias in the place where it is possible to eradicate them, as for crane which is in the breasts or in the thigh and seem like the members allocated to carry all of that, and especially when beginning small.
When it comes to an old wound and inflammation, you should not think that this is something you can cure on your own, nor have I ever seen it, nor do I know if it has been cured for this.
When the operation is about to be performed, as we have said, it is because you precede and lay open the patient's thighs and remove dark-colored blood from some veins, and then observe that, if it is greatly swollen, it indicates a manifest repletion.
And prepare the patient in the preparation that is located at the operation site, and propose it in the trunk that corresponds to that; and carefully examine all parts of the body for any cause of the patient's discomfort within which there is no known cause of the pain. And lay open the wound, and do not leave it uncovered, and expose the parts, and cleanse the wound as much as possible with your own hand or with the instrument that is nearest to you of the instruments.
If you find that the wound is too large in size due to vein or artery, then cauterize it within which the flow of the wound has ceased, and treat it with another treatment within which it is cured.
Chapter 6.
Of the cure of gout.
We have already recommended, in the division, of the herbs of gout of the water, and the doses of each herb for the cure of the patient by the physician.
When that which is cured is iron, it is not merely the specific of althitas alone, nor is it similar to the specific of timpanists or hypoparcities, for it is mortal.
When you have already treated this case of gout with the remedy and it does not improve your treatment, you consider that if in the thigh it has been achieved a reduction, or in another part of the body another gout, it is necessary to do so as if it were a disease of the belly or chest, and you keep away from it because there is fear of this.
If you see the female genitalia exuberant and not another part of the body except for the buttocks, and not a child or an old woman, then the hand of the operation of the patient is what you elevate between your own legs, and you minister the belly of the patient with your hand, pouring water into the end of the penile root, and then take spun sand in this form:
It should be two sharp points, of sharp extremity like sand; but rather it should be short in small pieces, so that in the operation it does not pass into the intestine, and that you can see it.
And if you consider that the generation of hydrocums is from the feet, then know that I lay my hand on your umbilicus for the quantity of three fingers on each point, on the left side over the penile root.
If the generation of hydrocums is from the male genitalia, then your section should be on the left side of the umbilicus for three fingers.
If the generation of the child is through the table, then your section should be on the left side.
And it is not necessary for your section to be on the side of the belly that you want to cut to avoid the superfluous parts from being in that place.
And through the entire instrument perforate the abdomen, and enter it in that section, and lift your hand with the spatula between the abdominal wall and the sigmoid, and you remove that; and if the quantity of a single or several.
And through the sigmoid perforate the colon that the spatula reaches to the place you want, and that is the location of the water. And remove that and enter an instrument of which this is the form: And it is resemblant to a silver canula; it is made of silver, or of gold, or of lead, at which in the part where the small hole is, there is a little tuft, and on the sides of it three holes: two of one part and one of another part; and it is the end of the incision according to the pen of the feather, as many times as possible.
When removing the umbilical cord, there is an armillary sphere around it. When the instrument reaches the water, you should cover the instrument with that much water, so if you empty that amount of water in a short time, either the woman will resolve the spiritual cause of her illness, or she will have five pains before her death.
Then empty the second portion of the water, and then what do you mean by your arrangements of the body's virtue of the pole of the will and the beauty of the will?
And when you remove the instrument, and wet the water that causes it, the amount that is held by the girdle that covers the part of the cipher which is recommended to you to perform that second portion,
And repeat the instrument on another day as often as the woman tolerates it, and take a small amount of water from the water, and do this for several days out of fear, and keep you from error by not drinking water except little.
If you fear the woman, and drink a large amount of water, then you cure that by burying it in sand, and moving it in the water, and leaving it under the sun for a long time; and you cure that with desiccating medicines when it is healthy.
And apply cauterization on the stomach, and the cloth is made as close as possible to the extraction of the water, according to what you have already mentioned in this regard.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but "Capitol .lv
Of the treatment of children who are born with the locations of the urethra not perforated.
Some of the children are lying on their stomachs, with their feet towards the chest of their mother and the head of their mixture is not perforated (or is straight or not in its place).
Therefore, the cauterization should be made without perforation of the urethra as much as possible, according to this form:
And place a soft cushion under the back and tie it with that, and either for three days or for half an hour.
And when the child's urine becomes more and watery, and return that.
And if you do not place the cushion, it is possible that the urine will cover the area, and this cushion will not be effective.
More of that which the cushion is straight, should be treated with a pillow of Plomb, as has been said, for several days until it becomes amplified.
When the thread does not remain in its place, it is due to those, which is the cause of these, that one must cut off the tip of the penis, because it cannot urinate into the parts below, therefore when it raises the penis above its ma, into the parts above; and it is not of this generation, because the sperm does not reach the upper part of the rectum, and it is a waste of time.
The maneuver of the operation in it is that the thigh should be covered over the right side, and extend the tip of the penis to your left hand with vehement extraction, and insert the tip of the penis of the location of the perineum into the hole, as if it were written with a pen, or if you do not know any part, because it seems that the tip of the penis will resemble the head of the penis and the thread will fall in its place behind that.
And keep in mind that in your operation of bloodletting of the sac, four things may happen to you; and stop you at once to him as he descends the sac, and care for the wound when it is cured.
The first line of the text is "Capitol .lvi." which
The first line of the text is "Capitol .lvi." which translates to "Capitol 66." However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the meaning of this specific line in the context of the medieval medical treatise. The following lines provide more context:
When visible blisters occur on this alabaster in the skin and are an indication of dry skin.
And one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
Not malignant, cover that with a fine cloth and remove the entire wound; and place your hand over the submerged cot in Egyptian sand; and that, apply the ointment daily between the wounds until they heal.
And if the alabaster is malignant, cover that with a layer of dark color and then you must apply cauterization to the incision and its edges.
If the alabaster is not circumcised at the beginning of the foreskin and one part of the alabaster is removed from the foreskin and the other part is left intact, then cover that with alabaster which is removed at the beginning until it is consolidated; and when you cure that defect, be sure that it is not torn.
And if inflammation and dark discoloration and corrugatedness occur in the genitals and foreskin, then cover that with everything that has already been damaged and that is about to become corrupted or corrupted; and place lines over that, the which is cut with flour of old mill grain and crushed and hammered.
When treating one part of the body, it is customary to enter another healthy part to do so.
When there is an abundance of blood, you should administer cauterization in this manner:
When the hot iron is applied in two ways, it is used to treat scars and the plague when it has become corrupt.
And if the head of the beard is corrupted and destroyed entirely in that hour, you must believe that you have inserted in the meat of the prepuce a catheter for that the urine will pass through that.
In the attachment of the prepuce to the beard (and this attachment does not happen except in the one where the prepuce is, and over it there is no circumcision; and when the attachment happens due to the plague or scarlet fever) you must believe that you can remove the soft exfoliated scurf that is inside when the lip is dissolved and the beard of the beard is completely destroyed.
And if it is difficult to remove those exquisitely, you must believe that you can remove the soft exfoliated scurf from the beard and the prepuce, and thus the prepuce, when it is very thin, is perforated by its subtlety.
And then separate the prepuce from the beard of the beard by the thin part, which is already sanded in the water so that they do not stick to another surface.
And if the wound is properly cared for, it should be stitched inside as soon as it has solidified.
Capitol.lvii. is not a complete sentence and does not provide
Of the worldly education of children and the care of that which happens to those who undergo circumcision.
Circumcision is not the solution to all diseases as others are: rather, it is our operation and will, and its application in children is necessary if we assign it to a better operation and let the lost ones be healed.
Therefore, it is said that the ancients did not practice circumcision on free women, who did not use it in their laws, and it is only because they have acquired by experiment that the majority of artisans and barbers have given up circumcising and washing, using false lips and piercings instead; and they use gold and silver instead of unguents.
And you have already forbidden all these methods and do not improve better washing of artisans and barbers, using false lips and piercings instead of unguents, where the prepuce is covered by two layers, and the tonica is applied later, and very little is used for another inscription and pain. And the washing used by alphekaties and is digital, which are used by scissors, is not securely applied to the end of the male member, where a lot of it enters the wound of the man.
In the operation of making a point, it is often necessary to use iron and corrupt your operation. And the child's code is short by nature, and guided waves are not used in that manner that there is no need for modification, and you have seen that one.
Mays of the modification that is made by force and twisting is not beneficial, and I have seen that it is not true, and for that reason the modification is not proportional in size, therefore the sharpness that is obtained is as the sharpness that is later; and thus when you prepare your own proportioned two sharpness, and inscribe one according to a comparison in a time; and it is compression of the flesh that contains the figure of the thigh of the whole part, which does not make an error of the whole.
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child stand upright if it is of those that I understand to be small, which you do not make except that you listen to the flesh in its thigh so only, and that you let it enter another day.
When you have caused that joy to be felt throughout that entire manuscript, which is possible for you to receive in your understanding. And make sure that it is firmly placed between your own hands, and do not be afraid; and hide the forceps in your hand or behind the foot, so that the child does not see those or other instruments.
And place your hand on the thigh and exhale into the codena, and remove that which is causing the head of the thigh to be swollen, and adjust that according to what is added to it for the deaf.
The form of the splints in mythology, this is the form:
When some are too thin and others are too fat, it is not the same as the length of the claw, and the length of the fingers is similar to the length of two nails.
When there is an error in human creation, it is usually because the core code has been hidden entirely, or a part of it has been omitted.
Therefore, extend that part of your body that you have been using during the session to the location where the appointment was made and insert that second equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your own hand, take that part from another and insert it there.
If it has been three days and the doctor says that the incision is healing well, you should wash it with water inside the incision when it is easy to do so, and insert the second part there.
And keep the head of the incision in your mouth, so that it does not get in the way of that.
And then treat that part with the pus that has been recommended in the treatment of the powders, so that it becomes solidified.
And if it is inserted over measurement and follows the parts according to measure, you will not notice it.
And then treat that part with what has been said inside so that it is cured.
Chapter 88.
Of the cure of urine retained in the bladder.
When there is retention of urine in the bladder, it is caused by inflammation of the urinary passages or by scarring, or by polyps or carnoids, and it resembles the symptoms described by doctors for the mania of curing in division.
And if the urine is not dissolved and you feel that there is heat on the thigh, then wrap the cause over the thigh with a bandage of the kind that is called a hydragogue, which is made of silver and subtle lion, like this: The substance is silver and the subtlety is like the tip of a palm, to which a subtle thread is attached, like this: The thread is subtle at the top.
And the manicure of the elimination of urine for that which you hold in your hand is to fold the nail and lie on the hair or beard for good cutting; and insert the extractions of the nail into the part behind the ring, and if there are any causes of the hair in the forfexes, then introduce it in the canula with vehemence and close the ring with the border and album of the hair.
When the joint pain is on the thigh, and the doctor touches the patient's wet skin with his hand, he should use olive oil and water.
Then the doctor should gently enter the anus with his finger; then double the penis back towards the belly button; then press the cirenza tightly at that point; and then press it inside as soon as it reaches the vesica, and the cause of the pain in the thigh will be revealed, and this order should not be reversed, except in cases of harm.
And gently extend the gauze as small as possible, until the urine soaks through the gauze.
Remove the gauze and use a cork to cleanse the urine, and do not stop until it is empty and use the cork as soon as the vesica and thigh are relieved of pain.
Chapter 17.
The quality of vesica clistering is determined by clamping it and using appropriate instruments that are suitable for the purpose.
When an ulcer or gangrene occurs in the vesica, or is affected by it, or is caused by it, and you want to distill water and medicines in that place, then use the following instrument, which is called a clamp: and this is its form.
However, if the extraction of the medicine is difficult, it is closed. And there are three ways: two from one side, as many times as necessary.
In the beginning, it is located in the place where the intestine is drawn out, and as many times as it is compressed, plus the second quantity that pulls that, if at any time a cause is found for that pulled-out intestine to be loosened, it is tightened, and when it is expelled, it is loosened, plus the third quantity that clamps the clamp on the battles of the sea.
Therefore, if you want to prevent moisture in the vesica, enter the end of the clamp into the moisture, and tighten it on that water that is drawn out into the parts, and the moisture is tightened in the cavity of the clamp.
When the swelling of the clavicle is to be extracted from the neck, as has been recommended in the ring; and when you press on it with your hand, push it in as far as it will go, and the moisture that presses in will reach the vesica so much, and the shoulder will cent around it.
The form of the vesica that is crystallized by the subtle cristeri, and that is that form:
And it is made of silver or gold, of which the head may seem like a small quill, and from which the point is bent.
And take the vesica by force, and stop in that place where you want to crystallize the moisture in the vesica, and place it between two with great care, and heat that moisture over the fire.
And open the end of the crystal at the neck.
And stretch your hand over the vesica with the moisture that is being stretched into the shoulder that has already centered around that humidity, which has already permeated the vesica.
If you do not have a vesicle in your body, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle around it; and perforate that through the entire circumference; and enter into those very places where it was rolled up; and add to the circle those places where they are added also, because you will have to wait in that place where you want to be with wetness and lice.
And then you will tie that in the instrument and make it as you have made it in the vesicle, and express it out of the vessel, and enter if wetness comes to the vesicle.
Chapter 60.
Of extracting stones.
We have already spoken in the division about the kinds of stones and their curing in medicine, and the difference between stones that are generated in the testicles and stones that are generated in the vagina, and their symptoms.
And it has been said which kind of stone I operate on most often, and cut.
And the stone generated in the vagina is that which is found in the vagina.
You tell that story to that man in that manifest exposure and abbreviation.
Then I say that pus is born in the major vesica and appears to be urine in its subtlety, appearing in that arena; and the vagina covers her genitals, and wet eyes, and appropriately dressed; and then she has for the anus in motion of those.
And it is the laughter of the pediatric care of the children who have reached fourteen years; and it is difficult to cure in the old. More in the young, it is easier for that which is between those.
And of that which the pus is greater and the cure is more difficult; and if it is little, it is opposite to that.
Then how to reach the cure of that, come at the beginning of that which is the anus of Christians who extract the whole fence that is in their intestines; then that fence has some eyes prohibits the entrance of the pus, and you must do the investigation of that.
When it comes to the genitals, the testicles should be placed close to the feet and be covered and protected so that the urine does not fall on the ground or jump from one place to another.
Then place the seal between your own prepared hands and the hands of the other person, and place their feet on the cushions, so that the entire vagina is supported in its respective parts.
And make sure to do this and everything else correctly.
If you feel the urine on your skin, then carefully cut around it as much as possible.
If you do not completely cover the entire area with your hand, then cover it as much as possible with the left hand of the right side if it is a male child, or the right hand if it is a female child, and insert it into the vaginal mouth. And make sure to insert the urine when it is out of the vagina. And gradually insert it into the corner of the vagina.
And press on that as much as possible, and expel it into the respective parts of the vagina from the location where you cut.
When the physician commands the attendant to press on the patient's vesica with her hand, and commands another attendant to extend the fingers of the left hand over the parts that are about to be cut, and to hold the needle that is about to be inserted into the parts, from the location where the incision will be made.
And it is appropriate to enter the spatulum with the tip of the needle that has been inserted into the part, and this is the form of the needle. And it is appropriate to cut the spatulum in the part that has been inserted between the thigh and the genitals, not in the middle of the cushion; and this is the incision over the same point as the one mentioned earlier, and it is a transverse section, so that the incision is wide and follows the quantity of the penis that can be cut, and not more, for if you cut the part that is in the thigh with the incision, the defacultat will be forgotten.
And you know that from the penis there is one part that has an angle and margins, so the incision of the penis is difficult for this reason.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
If it is that which has hard angles and corners, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not forgotten, you should know how to hold onto that, or how to grip it gently with the hand, using the extremity that is nearest to the part on which you are gripping, and not let go until you have reached the end of the curved extremity.
If you cannot hold onto that, then enlarge the hole a little, and if you see fluid coming out, tighten on that part with vitriol that has been sliced.
If the skin is thinner, then at the beginning you press the hand into the opening of the vagina and place it inside there; and then press a little water; and seemingly make if the movements are fewer in number.
And if the skin is very large, then you should not insert your hand into that very wide section, for there may be one of two causes: either it is slow or it has turned into a continuous distillation of urine, so that the place is not fully consolidated.
When an expelled piece of bone is outside the body and has been removed, or when there is an injury in the fracture of the bone that extends to the toes, it is necessary to reduce it back into its place.
After completing your operation, you will fill the wound with pieces of aloe and dried dragon's blood, and then press it down. And place olive oil on that wound and wrap it with lint or red olive oil and fresh herbs, so that the stitch may be healed.
And return the thigh to its position, and do not slide the ligament over the third day.
And when that has slid, anoint the place with water and oil, and carefully cure it day by day, until it becomes healthy again.
If in the wound there is a postoperative hematoma, swelling, and it appears as if the sutures are in the frozen vagina, and for that reason the prohibited ointment (and this is known because of the excretion of the sutures from urine) is entered into the wound and the sutures are extracted, then the wound may cause corrosion of the vagina and putrefaction.
When the wound is washed with water that is cool, clean, and saltwater, and is dressed in a way that is suitable for the patient's recovery, it is then ready for the cure to begin within the body when it becomes healthy again.
And cover the entire period of the cure during which you measure the thighs and adjust the medications that were placed over the area.
If the stone is small and is in the middle of the bladder, and is stuck there, and urination is prohibited, then you cure this as follows: remove it with a steel perforator of the type shown below. And if this has been done, and it has been found that many cases of this have been caused by cutting, then you know that you have done it correctly.
using a triangular extrusion, cut, and stick to the wood.
And hold on tight, and pull it out, and leave the stone in the bladder so that it does not return to the cavity.
And enter the steel into the bladder, using the perforator easily as it comes to that stone. When you revolve the drill in your hand and slowly enter that part of the other member, the urine will be completely emptied.
And press your hand over that which is raised from the thigh bone, where that part is rough and the urine is forgotten, and the wound is healed, and the patient is cured.
If this cure is not for you due to any cause that forbids it from being done on that part, then place a true needle on the thigh bone and another one on the other part. And close the wound on the thigh bone between those two incisions. And remove that. And cut the ligament and modify the scar made in the plague.
And it is not necessary to cut the ligament on the thigh bone except that it does not return to the vesica, and the other ligament only, where when the needle is slid along the thigh bone, the coda returns to its place and takes the plague.
When it is necessary for you to have the patient's belly exposed, that you raise the gut or return the tip to its place, and take the plague away from where they have said.

And the second is that you do not find a woman who is scientific enough to remove it when she is in childbirth, or if it is a woman who has not given birth.
The third is that you do not know this art, especially the operation itself.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision on the foot in women is longer than the location of the foot, so it requires an excessive incision, and there is fear in that.
If necessary, it is possible that you will find that you hold a woman's leg scientifically, and it is not too difficult.
If you are not familiar with that, you should search for a woman's leg scientifically, or present a mature woman in the female genital area, or a woman who is experienced in this art in this art.
Therefore, make that presentation, and command the one who will do everything you ask, from the investigation of the foot to the beginning; which causes is that he looks if the woman is lacking in strength, you find that you hold the leg where you say in the buttocks of the man and want the foot.
If that fails, cut that part out and command him to put it back on where he found it.
If it is not seen, command the midwife to insert what was given into the woman's cavity and place her left hand over the vagina, and hold that well.
If that fails, carefully cut that part off and place it back on where you found the parts, taking care not to harm the vagina as you go.
And place it back on the appointed place of the woman's cavity, taking care to place the vagina in that position and close the opening, and he will say that it is not causing any pain to the vagina.
And the incision should be small at the beginning; and then insert the ray over that incision, and if you feel the vagina, command to make the incision according to the amount that you know the vagina will bleed from that.
You know that the parts of the vagina are different: four of them are small and large, rough and harsh, long and round, and have sharp points.
This is French, and it translates to: "So you know how many species there are for this one that you signify about which you want to speak.
If you wish to draw out a gallstone, adjust in the location where it was passed and take it out within an hour after it has been separated, and then return to your operation once the stone has been removed and the urine has been emptied.
And make sure you have the necessary instruments ready for the removal of stones in men, so that you can assist those in your operation.
If you wish to draw out a gallstone, and you know that the expulsion of the stone is from the bile duct, then take some powder on the spot and sprinkle it over the area, stretch the pulley and tighten the strap, and do not repeat this; and remove the stone and do not force it out, for fear of killing the patient. And treat the plague.
Once the hardness of the gallstone has been reduced to a manageable size and the area is clean, then return to your operation once the stone has been removed and the urine has been emptied.

Of cutting for hernia repair.
The first source sentence translates to: "Hernia is not merely an addition of moisture in the white cord, which is left by the genitals containing the seed, and is called the cord.
When some veins are in the same body as the one prepared for the patient's nature in the part of the gout, and it is said that another gout has been seen; and the code of the generative organ between the white bladder which has been said, and no one else but tar.
The generation of this hernia is due to the reduction of that which happens to the generatives, because it comes into contact with this material, and some have happened by striking a point on the generatives.
This humidity has various colors, whether the color is red or pink, or sanguineous, or black putrid, or white stinking, or blue watery, and it is less.
The washes by which this addition of water is cleaned are those: if it is in the white circle that has been mentioned, then you should reduce it to a few centimeters long as a figure of a hair, and appear the generative, where the humidity counts that part of everything.
And if the humidity is in the proper panniculus, then you should reduce it to a part of the hair and by another man it is estimated that there is another humidity.
And if the humidity is between the tail of the generatives and the white circle, then you should reduce it further.
And when you want to know the color of the humidity, you should spread the color of the humidity on the apothecary in front of the one that is preceded by a form; and after that, which is found in the style of the front, judge from there what it belongs to.
When we arrive at the patient's bedside, you should cover them with blankets as ordered by the physician, and sometimes the part of their body.
When it is necessary to lie down on the patient's back for a short period of time, and pause the movement of the limbs.
And place yourself on the left side of the patient, and instruct the attendant to stand on the right side, who then extends their arm from the hip to the two lats to the abdomen muscles and the pubic area of the stomach.
And take some fat and divide the abdominal muscles of the lower part of the patient's body along the length of the pubic area.
If the cut is made at a right angle to the line that should be parallel to the pubic area, then it will reach the white part of the hip bone.
And remove it, and observe, and keep this for yourself so that you do not insert it again; and your extraction is the one that you remove by partida jassia which is suspended from the hand of the mays and carefully scrutinizes the extraction according to the quantity that you can possibly.
And drill a hole in the white part of the hip bone with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And if you want to separate the two lips of the labium from the gash made by the uncinate process, and extend the cicatrix along the parts below; and do not touch the cord with the tongue comprehending, and insert the cicatrix into that hand which is as possible for you. And insert it into its entirety or into the stool, and mainly the part that is subtle, for if you do not carefully examine the insertion of Lu, it is not guaranteed that the water will not return.
If the woman's process is processed in that place of her cord during your operation, when you have completed the gash of the cicatrix, return it to its place, and adjust the two lips of the cord of the genitals by suturing, and care for that area as the others, if it is healthy.
And if the woman's process is corrupted by another defect, know that you lie the ways in which those that have said it are suspended, and extract the woman, and care for that area as you have been told.
If the water is added in some parts, know that those are the hernias; therefore, insert it into that part according to what you have done in the other engagement; and if you see that it is an operation, then do it.
Then you should remove the sutures, and enter into the submerged or dyed lanes; and pause another lane that you have submerged in oil and vinegar; and expand it over two genitals and the mirror of the stomach; and pause unfolding wrinkles and powders, and lay them on those that you unfold following this form:
Then you should fold the preses of two draps and their woolen humplings according to this resemblance; and their points are at the ends that are pressed by a gut or wet wool, and they are added to the structure in the thigh bone, and the one of the ends grabs the buttock inside the two, and the other grabs the pantile's end, and two extractions over two cushions and two extractions on the ankle bones, and all the tightening is adjusted in the thigh bone.
And some of these hernias are treated artificially with cauterization at the site of the cut; and it is that you hold cauterization with a subtle piercing tool and insert it into the chain of the gallbladder, and it ignites afterwards if they have recommended entering within what is discovered the white bladder containing water, and you hold the cauterization in this form: When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in
And if you pierce it with a pointed cautery, and it burns when all the wetness is outside.
When you extend the nail of a toe, remove the skin around it, and gently burn the cauterization with a fine fire; and insert the second one that is possible for you to enter if you eliminate all of it; and keep in mind the pain that the fire will cause.
You know that this operation is saved and long-lasting for the flow of sweat, and better than the section operation.
If you have an objection to postpone the cauterization or the cut at the time of the section or during the flow of sweat, then know that this objection is for your own good, and you should cure it in the way that is most convenient for you.
If the wound is frightening and you do not expect the second operation because of its horror, then administer the second operation as you recommend; and when you are certain that you must, for what has been said about the significance, that this hernia is dangerous.
You know that you should make the wound on an elevated piece of wood, as you postpone the cauterization at the lowest part of the nail where the sweat comes out, and stop the perforation after the length of the cos.
When the wound is wide open and the poison has spread throughout the body.
Then place your hand over the affected area and press it firmly, so that the pus comes out of the wound. And then care for that area to ensure that the sore is healed.
However, if there is contradiction in the treatment of pus at that time, and you perforate it: then it is not done but for the fact that the white panellum in the wound causes contradiction and prohibits the oozing of pus. Then, as you place your hand in the wound, use a needle or an instrument of the type from which the pus is extracted from the abscesses, in the form that precedes; or adjust in the oppression of the wound a small piece.
And you know that the pus returns, and it is excreted in about six months or more; and when it is added, you should perforate again with that hand that has been in the wound for several days.

When cutting on a hernia of the flesh and its treatment.
You should be aware that in the section over this hernia, there is fear of poisoning in the larger parts; because I have seen the dismission of it and it was saved for the better.
And you remember the operation in that place and the specifics of the apprentices.
Therefore, say that the apprentices are born in those whose genes are combined and caused by sudden sharp causes: either by acute inflammation, which is spread to the genes, or by puncture.
And is the color of the apprentice like the color of the skin, and it does not become pale in that pain, and it is a heavy apprentice.
And very much is the apprentice limpid, of which the color is dark, and it does not cause harm to it.
And some points are made by the pressure of the arteries, and by inflammation of those veins that were previously known by the rememoration of the pain, or by inflammation of the veins.
Moreover, that is known as inflammation of the arteries because of the distribution of the apprentice when you compress that with your hands; and it does not touch that.
Moreover, what is made by inflammation of the vein is not dispersed by any cause due to the compression of that with your hands.
When it is possible that this species is a section of the clitoris and the others; and that you insert the code of the gentry, and extend it to the parts thereof, and extract that of the white cube, and untie the suspensors of the feet, and tie them, and insert the suspensors that you untied from the entire part of the parts of the clitoris.
If the clitoris has already been anchored to those solid flesh parts, then you should take out the clitoris and insert it there.
And if adhesion comes between any cause of the white cube or between that which is between the thighs, then you should take out all that adhesion and insert it there by means of a round insertion.
If the tissue is native to the place of the adhesion that is behind, then you should insert all that there is of it and take out the clitoris as they have said.
So when you have completed your operation, fill the wool with the red oil and vinegar and leave it to cure by itself for the other care that is needed when it is healthy.

In the treatment of this condition, there is fear of that which precedes the rememoration.
However, I believe we are speaking of an operation in the second place, having done the first.
And say that you cover the thigh on an elevated pillow; and remove the suspensors of the testicles to the parts below; and take the codon of the genitals at the ends, and apply it to the belly as you describe to the verge; and hold onto those other ministers that you, and extend them vehemently.

And you cure the plague by curing the other plagues in which you want to be generated by that which causes the wounds that do not have two genes, which is not bad for this.
If injuries occur in all parts of the body, it is necessary to know whether the testicles are extruded or if the testicles due to this cause damage to the organs, so that they are deprived of all nutrition by the incision of the organs, and they are established, or if it is because it is not young in those.

Of the cure of hernia inguinal.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a cut that extends over the abdomen from the sides of the stomach, which causes the intestines of that rupture to be pushed out of their place.
This rupture is either of the gallbladder or gallstone, and it happens due to specific causes: such as impact, nausea, clamor, elevation of any heavy cause, or appearance.
The symptom of this is, when it extends to the gallbladder, it happens gradually over a long time and does not stop, and it causes pain in the abdomen after the gallbladder has swallowed the intestine.
The symptom of this is when it extends to the gallbladder, it causes sudden and intense pain at the beginning; and it appears different apparents from the usual one, and this is due to inflammation of the intestine, and the cause of this is in the parts deformed by the gallbladder.

And thus, treat the wound as in the treatment of diseases, and when you insert the fingers, cleanse that and restore the wound within which it was consolidated; for the thumb is contracted and not adjusted to the prominence of the rupture.
And cauterization is better in this place, where there is proper pressure for health.

I apologize, but the provided text does not contain a valid source sentence "Cap
This sentence appears to be in a medieval language, possibly similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, or French. Here's a possible translation:
The first source sentence translates to:
When you see those symptoms, you know that the abdomen of the patient is becoming concave due to the embryo's lightness when they are placed on their side, on the abdomen, and on the second side, and it is monitored for any excess flabbiness in good manner.
If that part is not natural and not usable, then when the embryo is placed on your feet and the body of the patient is placed in front of the head of the patient and the legs of the patient, or on the chest of the patient, or on the abdomen of the patient, and it is converted over the side of the belly, and resembles the figures of the patient's non-usable parts.
A necessary cause is for the midwife who is wise and subtle in all those causes, and she should guard against error and disappointment.
And you showing all figure of those, and which engine is in those for that and it has been over there.
When the pain is placed on the side of the head for natural relief, and that is very strong on the female and it is made in a difficult part, and sometimes the virtue of it has been weakened, then do as follows: give that remedy, or have the women hold it for you, and evaporate the conh of the fenugrec coyt and the olis humitz.
When the midwife inserts the roller between the patient's thighs, or if she does so on the second occasion, or if she does so within a certain period of time due to the heat in the room, it is customary for doctors to be present. And press the woman's abdomen when she is about to give birth.
If she does not give birth, it is customary to believe that the woman is obstructed by mucus from the pith and mucus from fenugreek.
And command the woman, the midwife, that it be broken and that she should pull out the child; and open her mouth and make her swallow the child in one hour, so that the fetus is no more than ten centimeters long.
And if the pills are given to the child too early in the pregnancy, it is customary to believe that the mother's belly becomes smaller and smaller little by little. If the woman does not obey the command, place the woman on a pillow and lift her legs up, and cover the pillow with a cloth; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the concussion.
If the hands are not turned and do not feel the foot, then inscribe those and extract the remainder of the foot or the corresponding part of the body from the clothing and extract that equality, which will be forgotten later.
When you press on the feet of the embryo, you must push those inside, and then convert the small foot into a larger one, and then pull out that part, and then take a piece from the body and stretch those small parts little by little.

And if you do not forget that they have recommended this, you return the small part little by little into its place when you stop the second natural figure, and that part will be forgotten as congestion.
And if it is prohibited to do all that has been recommended, you take some muslin and some dissolved gum, and apply them all to the mortar with good percussion, and line up in order what has been said about the female part, and pull out the pus from the belly of the body. And then make that cezear in water beef, when you achieve the hypocalcification.
When sometimes the parts that leave the patient are lenient, then place them under the mistletoe and under pause at that place. When the sub-fumigation lasts for an hour, then place a cloth on a plate, and make it turn and extend the mouth of the patient, and take it off, and press the lower part of the abdomen of the patient with a slight compression, so that the following part is as little noticed.
A description of the fetus laterally while one of the patient's hands is held. The ingeniousness lies in the reduction of the pelvis of the patient, if you cannot do it, lift the woman and make that go away.
And if it does not go away, place the pillow on the bed, and compress the patient's thighs with strong pressure, and apply ointments to the parts that you see and recommend mucilages.
And if the child comes out, place that stopper on the bed, and study about the reduction of the pelvis, and gently pull out the fetus in the second natural position, and make the woman stop and command her to understand when she enters that it is forgotten.
Description of the fetus laterally while the patient's hand expands and the abdomen of the patient is on the two sides of its mother. When the midwife holds the child's head and gently rolls it bit by bit, and thus makes it easier.
And when you have finished, and the doctor has recommended oil and mulculages, then pause over the area where they have recommended the oil and mulculages.
And when you command him to make small incisions and when he has made the incision, then make a ceiling over one cezalha and command him that it should be inclined towards the left side, and command him that it should be compressed; and make that stornudar am condizi. The child's exit is prepared on the side.
When you have finished this maneuver, consider, and if you want, you can insert the second finger inside when it is empty of water.
And if the child is hung over the face and neck, then insert your finger into the umbilicus, so that it does not stick and hang.
And when you press the child into the parts of the dintz when you pause the second that covers it, and tell the woman to compress a little if any veins are seen, and the excrement will be outside the body, if God or the devil.
The first line of the text is a Latin phrase that translates to "Exitus geminerum aut foetorum mult The first line of the text translates to: "You should know that visible joint motions are common in many people, and sometimes three or four, but this is not strange or rare; rather, it is a natural cause, and not life-threatening.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When it is difficult to find the cause of the pain and one has heard about the natural figures, then you should treat those as they have been found.
If the midwife is clever and knows what to do, it will be easy and subtle, and will take time, and should be an engineer for each figure that the physician has prepared to bring about health.
Remembering this which is formed from the matrix of embryos and are aborted.
Some are formed in the larger ones, and two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and ten, and you must now verify that a woman aborts not more than six, and another one formed, which causes a lot of pain due to the measurement of the glorious savors.
And so it is also true that in the science of the midwife, for that which seems to be like this, and therefore pauses at that point as such, it covers that.
Chapter 76.
Of extracting the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead body as if it were alive and not deformed, and you have used it for operation, then consider whether the female is of healthy virtue and not of those accidents by which she has suffered loss.
Consider whether the female is lying on her side over the left knee, and if her head is inclined towards the opposite side and her thighs are raised.
He should hold that part or lay it on the bed so that this does not extend beyond the extraction of the foot.
And if you wet the mouth of the older woman with humors, mucilage of aloe and fenugreek, and semen of li, then...
And you wet the midwife her own, with those humors and mucilages, and you introduce it into the woman's vagina, and you find the place where the tubes are in the foot.
And the appropriate places to insert: then consider whether the foot is prepared to be placed on the left knee, and you keep the points in the holes of the thigh, or in the collar, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or the beard, or in the shoulder blade, or in the groins, or in the hypochondriacs.
When the pain is on the feet of the patient, it is necessary to apply the menthol cream or the essential oil of the back of the costal cartilage.
And keep the other hand on the patient's back, and straighten the curvature of the spine in that location where the left side of the patient's belly meets the spine, and gently press with the other hand on the areas that have been touched, until the cause is revealed.
And then stop and stay in the appropriate position of the patient with another hand, or the third if necessary, to avoid drawing blood and not extend too far behind the patient's rectum.
And be sure to follow the entire procedure, so that the removal of the growth is as effective as it is in dental treatment for the eradication of the patient.
And pay attention to the fact that the extension is smoothed; and if any part of the patient is held, it is necessary to cover the mother with oil and enter the areas where the expertise is and rotate around that which is held.
If the part of the foot is forgotten, then make the points in the location where it is pushed out; and enter if all of the foot is forgotten.
If the wound is located on the other side, and it cannot be reduced by cutting through that part, then cover that area with a cloth; and then extract that when all of it is out, and insert it either in the joint of the wound or in the groove.
And cover that on the other wound and on both feet.
If the head of the foot is large, or there is an issue with its cut in the wound, or the mouth of the water is adjusted at the top, then cover that between the three spines and cut the head and extract the water, or that discloses that using an instrument called "alundat", which is shaped like the other instruments in the capital that is appropriate for this.
If the foot is large by nature: and then cover that with an alum bath, or take that in an alum bath as they have said; and extract the bones from the forceps.
If the head is swollen and is causing discomfort, then you should cut through the collarbone. However, if the humidity that is in the chest is wet, then do not cut it.
If it is not complicated and the swelling is not large, then you can insert the needle as much as you can.
If the abdomen is swollen or protruding, you should cover that opening where moisture is present in the abdomen.
If the foot is swollen, draw out the humor from it and direct it towards the mouth of the mayre (a small vessel or tube).
If the belly is distended and the chest, you should cover that opening where the humor flows over your chest, and let out the belly and chest entrance where water runs through it.
If the other members are still closed and the hand is returned to the uterus, introduce the thumb into the left side of the uterus; if the mouth of the mayre is swollen, introduce it into the preon of the layre, and close the thumb at that point, and insert it into the mouth of the mayre again, and enter a small incision or two small incisions, and pull the thumb out through those.
And if the mouth of the mayre is swollen due to abscess, cover that opening so that it does not become thick over it; cover the opening with humid fatty substances. 1. Apply plasters; and follow the patient in warm applications that moisturize and hydrate.
If the point is on the side of the foot, then try to make it as small as possible, and administer it as they have said in the living foot.
If it is not possible to make it smaller, then inscribe it in pins and extract it.
And cover the second part without any cause of distortion.
When you have completed the entire operation, administer what they have said in the prescriptions to the post-operative patients with caution, using the needles that have caused damage to the most sensitive parts.
If there is a flow of blood, then dry it with wet compresses and administer the other cure.
And you have already seen a woman in the belly of whom there was a dead foot, and over that focus another was taken, and another dead foot is made for it. It happens at the appropriate time of the post-operative patient on the side of the embellished foot; and it becomes inflamed when it is full, and begins to twist the braces.
And you were called for the cure of the patient, and treated it for a long time, and the plague was not consolidated.
Then you should stop the patient from moving around, examine their hip, and pass your hand along it, and also examine another hip; and you were too surprised to see that there are no bones in the stomach.
And then you thought they were from the bones of the dead one.
Then you dug into the plague, and extracted the bones from the female present in the many holes disposed, and had already seen such a thing for a long time, corrected by a small piece of bone.
And you did not suspect it to be strange, but rather that this is known and helpful for the physician who uses the artificial hip to maintain the body's health.
Of the forms of the instruments necessary to extract the bone.
Form of the cut that is used to open it:
This is the form of the tightening in which you cut the free ends, in which the cutting has two virtues at the two extremities of two strings. However, this virtue may be covered with a fine string, and may be made of lead or of iron.
When the latitude of any force is two degrees and the margin of the same is one degree, and the longitude of that is a palm and a span; and in the middle location of two forces, so are their adjustments of those forces which have already been fixed, of which the longitude is a palm and a span, and the latitude is two degrees or a span.
These two additional measures are inserted in the mouth of the vagina so that it can be easily opened when you turn the prescribed virgins.
Another form resembling that of the subtle and lewd pus:
The point should be made by forceps according to the resemblance of the forceps. However, in the end of those two additions, and the longitude of those additions is a palm, and the latitude is two degrees.
And when you want to open that vagina, do as follows: make the woman lie down on her back with her legs hanging down, and open it between the thighs. When you start to work on the patient's mouth, use the instrument of your choice, according to the amount of appreciation you want for the size of the hole in the larger part that the meter passes through.
The way they used to tell the story was:
The way to push it is by using the force that pushes the foot.
The way to measure the size of the hole is by counting the largest part.
And it is suitable to use forceps at the end of the teeth, as many times as necessary, and some are made longer according to this form, as many times, on the teeth that are not cut and counted. The way to measure a small size is by counting the number of times it is used.
The way to determine if something has a spine is by looking for a spine.
The way to determine if something has multiple spines is by looking for multiple spines.
The way to determine if something has two ends is by looking for two ends.
The first line of the source sentence is "Forma de dos espatums latz," which translates
All the instruments that are exercised, and when you multiply the species of that and prepare them for the artificer, as it is placed in its operation and must be for the men according to their quantity.
When you have finished using those instruments, you must take them apart, as the need for them cannot be excused.
From the extraction of the second part.
When the second part is held, you must hold it with the appropriate force in the hurtful part that holds the desired effect, and apply pressure to that area to stop the bleeding, and press your hand on the mouth of the patient and over their nose, and if necessary, use a piece of cloth to absorb the blood.
And if not, you must take a needle and pierce through the covering into the cheek, stop there where the mouth of the patient is, and then cut off the excess skin from the corner of the mouth, as well as the gum, the camamilla, the scicados, the arabic cassia, and the santaurea. All of these herbs or some of them are submerged in water in the needle, and place it over the fire.
And then place a canula of cannabis in the mouth of the patient, and hold it until the vapor reaches the concave part of the mouth.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. Then return the intestine or hernia to
If the patient does not show signs of improvement after this treatment, you should command the midwife to immerse her left hand in warm water or ointment, and then enter it into the patient's abdomen and ask her to find the second one, and when she finds it, gently pull out that small piece by piece, so that the midwife does not cause the patient any pain. It is better to be moved to the right and left side for ease.
And if the mouth of the midwife is cut, we have already recommended this treatment for stunning and medication of the wound of the flesh.
If you do not forget all the causes that have been recommended, then remember that you should not exert yourself over that in the next abstraction, but rather consider that this is what is causing discomfort to the woman's mouth and the thigh of her male servant; fourth, this will cause discomfort for that area for about a week and will be dissolved and forgotten.
When it is swollen, it is the high male auditor of the head and stomach that leads to the disease, and therefore it leads to the malady; and then it is necessary that they be administered subfumigations and appropriate remedies for that.
Moreover, the ancients used subfumigation of nettles and dried figs.
Form of instrument by which the woman is subfumigated with the retention of menstruation and the second wind:
It may be seen or heard.
And the end is quietly placed under the hearth and the wide end over the fire, and the subfumigation is placed over the fire's breezes.
When you have consumed that part of the sub-humor, repeat another.
For the treatment of a non-perforating child's tailbone.
When a child has not yet been born and the feet of the woman do not come out, which have already become slender and thin. Then tell the midwife to push with the one that is said to be the first; and if not, push with the other, and make sure not to touch the umbilical cord.
Then put your hand over that soft fabric in the vagina and care for that part as it comes out.
If you fear that it is thin, stop for a moment with a catheter in the vagina and take it out when the child wants to cry.
And if you have already noticed thinning of the foot for the consolidation of plague or abscess; then make sure that this consolidation is solidified, and care for it as we have said about the cure and the poultice.
For the cure of the fistulas that I leave behind.
The fistulas that I leave behind in the part I cut are low in nutrients and large, which I leave behind either from the foot or in the space of one part.
When it is a fistula or abscess.
When that node is old and runs with the moisture of white or fine powder, and some are seen to enter these fistulas.
When those penetrations are caused by water that is excreted and ventilated; and some use the outlet for excretion, and more easily pass the worms.
When some of those fistulas are seen to enter the space that is penetrated into the vesica, and into the meat of the thigh; and when some enter the joint of the thigh and into the notch of the ankle.
Because of what is penetrated into the thigh and not penetrated, it is that you place the thin end in the thigh, and enter it subtly with iron or steel in the fistula when it is not turquoise.
If in that case there is turquoise, then enter you subtly with the end of the iron or the horse's hair in that which you feel with the end or the hair in the thin end.
If you do not feel that of the whole or do not proceed from any cause of evacuation, then know as they have said, it is not penetrating, and it is placed in the treatment.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the meat of the urethra, its meaning is the elimination of urine from that place and the prohibition of that location being in medicine.
If it penetrates into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and wound of pain in the circuit, you should understand that it may enter here if there is no turtuositat in the bone, and a wound in the circuit of the part; and that it must be closed all times; and that it does not belong to that medication, nor is consolidated in enguent.
And in all those fistulas that are not cured, the cure of those is labor and effort of the skilled surgeons over which it is placed.
If in that which is not penetrant and not antique, cure is hoped for by the iron, and that you have already recommended, and that you have already done.
Here comes the translation of the first source sentence:
If that part of the thigh is cold, you should cover it with the cloth that you inserted earlier in the wound.
If you feel that the part of the thigh is penetrated by the cloth that was inserted earlier in the wound, then you know for sure that this part is penetrated; and then do not work on that, as it is not in the sanacio, just as they have said.
However, they would say that it is healthy for men to be naked.
And for the medicine by which you expect to improve it, it is recommended that you gently ignite cauteries according to the size of the fistula, as previously stated, and then introduce the ignited cauteries into the fistula as close as possible to the wound; and repeat a few times until you know that all those adjusted fistulas with the appearance of a quill of feather are fully closed.
And if it is covered with clothes, close it as much as possible within that border where all those fleshy parts are located, and if it is cured by the medicine, then it is; and if not, you will not be healed in a short time by another cure.
If the probe enters and does not penetrate into the said one that is in the anus, and enters between that and the probe that is made of flesh or cartilage, and sometimes the fistula in it that is on the surface of the abdomen, then you should dry the abdomen of the starting point of the fistula, and see if the probe dries inside, and it should be inside the fistula when the cut reaches the location where the end of the fistula ends, and for the fistula it is released and tied.
And thoroughly clean those fistulous wounds that are assembled with a needle of ausel and do not have any cause for the others.
If the blood comes out several times between you and your operation when you touch those wounds, then you should milk that which is in it and the pus from the instrument that is cauterized with fire or with acute medicine, for cauterization with fire adjusts good habits: it is the adjustment of those wounds, and the abscission of the excess of humidity.
And with proper care, those swollen parts in the border or inside that location can be reduced by applying a bandage, and one should also care for the inflamed skin to harden and consolidate.
And in those medicines where there is sterilization and excitement; when restored, it is already healed and does not fear re-treatment.
If the fistula has already entered the anal opening and is extended from the surface of the skin, then one should enter the liquid into the anus and inquire about it.
And if the testicle is hard and you enter it with your hand or finger, and it is leading to penetration, then do not operate on it, but follow the second path of faith and hope.
This causes to be administered to it in one of three ways: either by cauterizing that swelling as has been said; or by pressing on that which you can achieve the consolidation of the part so that you can enter and treat those affected areas; and do not process if you have not cut the ligament containing the lacert, and it has happened over the wound of the egress of the operation of your will; and care for that as has been said that it may be healed; or by stretching that member and cleaning that pus which you cut from that entrance as has been said, or if you insert or another instrument of sharp end, and clean those fistulas which are in the section of the operation of which you can percrustacio; and force you to make the restoration of the whole plague by cutting, and if the pus does not become consolidated, and rampage the open fistula at the end of the anus, and it will be able to pass through the malaute. If any of the fistulas end in this manner: when you insert the catheter into the fistula, and it is located around the surface of the anus and in the margin of the buttocks, then you pull the catheter through the open end, which is like a needle for preparing the tissues according to this form:
When entering the abdomen through one of the three incisions or around it, and then attempting to enter the fistula within that finds the cavity of the belly.
If you penetrate the side of the buttocks as far as possible, then take out the tube from that hole which you introduced into the buttocks; and take out the end of the tube and adjust the two ends of the same, and stitch them, and leave it for a day or two, and when you have inserted the tube into the flesh, stitch around those parts of the tube that are inserted between the two ends of the tube and that draw in the flesh.
And then cure the plague when it is solidified and healed.
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrated, then make it penetrate, using any tool that you are prepared with, but do not force it into the pre-open, as you will not be able to do so when it is healed; and then make amends for that once it is healed.
The form of the sponge that is used to close the fistula: the curvature of which is sharp and the other part is not sharp, because it does not penetrate as much as necessary, it is therefore used only a few times.
When suturing hemorrhages that run along the incision of those parts.
Hemorrhages are followed by two stitches, either like threads that seem to be made of charcoal, or they are similar to the thick ones used for girdles. And they are both small and large, and the incision runs through them all, and the stitches, and the thighs, and the feet, and at their extremities.
However, those that are closest to the thighs are usually made of the skin of the buttocks, or a small piece of cloth, which is continuous in color with the rest of the body.
And the care of that which is directed to the thigh is that you command the patient to lie down and to express it when the thigh becomes sore and the hemorrhages appear to you. Then tie it and suspend the cusps or those you have with your own hands, and apply those to the parts that need them most.
If the cusps are not held in those parts due to humidity or softness of those, then take hold of them with dry or sharp or smooth hair, and remove them from the ties, and apply them at their ends, and sprinkle some powdered dust on them, so that they stick to those in place of cauterization; or cauterize them after having preceded the cauterization at the top of the cauterization. And thus, the care of those who are cured is taken over by another doctor when they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey the exit, then cut it and cristerize the abdomen in the same way as a little tooth, and wash it with that water that is in the bucket and that does not resist the exit gradually when the abdomen is full.
If the menstruation causes pain in the anus, then the cause of these is slight, and it is that you take those with your own hand or with another's, or with both hands, and insert them, and then care for those that have been inserted after they have been said to be cured.
And if those that have been inserted are maintained, then the suturing of them is done in this way: take a firm grip and enter it into the needle and extract the menstruation from the parts above, and make it penetrate into the needle in the other part, and cover the extramitted parts of the grip with the part behind the needle, and stretch them latitudinally; and stretch the menstruation to the structure, and then remove the grip and extract the needle.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And then place your hand on the buttocks and cover it with rose oil or citrus; and place that on the anus and command the patient to stop. And then open that wound; and when it is healed, cure those that have been cut or burned within that which has become healthy.
And if those do not improve with that medicine, you should know that I recommend applying ointment to those points or to the inside of the anus when they are wet and hostile to those that have been scarred by the pus; and then cure them after they have consolidated.

If you want, make the remedy as follows according to this form:
The part of the needle that is drawn from the canula should be made subtle, narrow (not pierced), wrapped around so that over the place where the learning of the gout is, it is cleansed and the rotation of that.

If the medicine forces it to subside, hold on tight as much as possible; and if you sleep for a whole night, it will be better in the morning.

And if in the buttocks there are hemorrhoids or fissures, then you should be a surgeon very subtle and lethal, of the surgeons that have their criteria for children.
In the cure of the plagues.
And you have already said in the division of the cure of the plagues that it is convenient for the free, and you say so that the cure of those and the medicines are according to the compliments.
Therefore, say that the plagues are diverse according to what is the cause of the plagues and according to the place where they are caught.
And the causes by which you see that the plagues are caused are such as gout, or scar tissue or cotel, or percussion, or thrust, or push, or slicing, or semblance to those causes of the motions.
When plagues are present in the parts of the body that are similar to those plagues on the head, neck, chest, belly, and other parts of the limbs, it is likely that they are caused by cold humors.
And you advise on the cure of some plagues based on that reasoning and rule about other plagues.
And you begin with the simple head plagues, where the reminder of the compounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, when a simple head plague occurs without fracture, consider whether it is due to gravel or resemblance, and if the gumma has already thickened and there is great inflammation and fear about the face, you should cut and flebotomize the head as soon as possible, and do not delay; and extract from the sac second according to the quantity of virtue of that, unless there is any other prohibiting cause for flebotomy, especially if the sac is swelling with the plague.
When the incision is made on the opposite side of the affected part; and keep an eye on the leg for swelling and large veins.
If during the operation any cause is forbidden, then you will be less hungry and will not approach flesh or fat.
And place your hand over the wound, if it happens to be a strangulation cautery, drop in oil of rose or in the part that is being stitched.
If you are sure that it is a strangulation cautery, then place your hand over the wound, if it has been recently cleaned and the air has not changed, use the powder that I recommend in small amounts.
If the air has already changed, then place your hand over the wound after it is cleansed.
If the wound is large or is due to incision and scarring, and the lips of the vagina are not properly adjusted for puss, then adjust those sutures according to the suturing I recommend for them.
If the wound has already been exposed to the os and pen, and is not retained by anything but a small suspensory, then incise that and apply appropriate care to the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in its proper place, and order the leg that is swollen to be massaged with oils in which there are herbs: caps and formen coyt and semblants of them, within which there is oil.
If the bone becomes rotten in the putrid code and does not adhere to the bone, you should incise all around it and drain the pus, and then dress it.
If in these diseases an artery or vein of that by which blood flows from the spleen can occur, and is not removed by doctors, you should inquire about the artery, and if it is not incised, you should incise it at the spumen; and if this causes discomfort, you should cauterize within that sac when it is abscised.
And if these diseases are simple and small, the cause is lighter; it is not certain that you powder over those this powder, which has become compacted there that the air changes those.
And the recipe for the powder is as follows: oil of enses divided into one, of dragon's blood divided into three, and of caus no-extincta in equal parts; all mixed and crushed, and the plague filled, and secured by good construction over that adheres, and coagulated at the sac.
When applying pressure to that area with your hands, and while you do not force it, do not apply too much pressure, as this may cause discomfort or harm to the patient during the treatment.
If any of these points is used alone, when you are not in present presence or do not have the patient's consent.
And this operation is performed on large pains when it is necessary to place it over them and make them straight, and recent pains that are close to the sacrum, where the air has not been altered.
If the air has been altered, especially during summer, you will not be able to see this powder at that position, nor will you be able to cure those who have said this, whether you press over those engorged parts or over the pores of the flour of the other juices and honey that have entered; and you will also cure those in another cure when they are cured.
If you happen to injure the bone in the foot and it is small, you should remove this powder from it.
When treating a fracture of the head, it is customary to use the remedy that has been found to be effective for gout.
Of the evils of the colon.
If the plague occurs in the colon, there is no difference in treatment between the plague of the head when it is simple.
If the nerves of the colon have been cut or the artery, then the nerves are in danger except that it is avoided surgery as much as possible that causes vehement stipticitis, and it is like glass and resembles those that are broken and do not cause harm to the nerves and contract. And do not pause over the plague any cause of all sweat, that the substance of the nerves is sweated and the continuation of it is to the brain, which is pushed away from all parts of the body.
And if this is treated with unnatural medicines, then see how the water that is washed with it is caused, some infused in rose oil or not, and when the water is washed with it and the other parts are washed with this method, and they find humidity.
When the plague is large, you should administer suture or scarify the lips of the patient, and then care for that area with powder once it is healed.
When the plague is deep or occurs in the lower part of the small intestine, it is necessary to perforate that in the location that is more affected.
When in the plague the artery is already inserted and a flux of blood occurs, it is necessary to separate or dry that, or tie that, or burn that if it is necessary to provoke a stop to that.
When the spine of the loin or neck is already inserted and the veins of the collar are saved, it is necessary to adjust the lips of the belly over the hip of the loin without touching that; then equalize that and reduce it over its natural figure, and tighten it in a straight line, and tie it for the days that are stitched; and cure that which is infected and excited in those where it is antiseptic.
When the plague has already settled in the bone and it is necessary to cut that, and if in it there are fragments of bones, extract all that you can from them; and what is not visible to you, tie it within the plague when it is cured, and separate and the egg of the bone is alleviated.
If the plague is recent, you should powder that powder that I recommended to you. If in the plague there is a fistula, you should cure that part with the medicine that will come to mind most quickly in the capital city.
If it is percussion of the anus or navel, and sometimes of the belly button, and you consider less if the plague has entered when the thighs are touched; you know that the plague is deadly.
And if in it there is no depth and the plague is recent to the capital city, you should pause in it for the first hour of powder, and do not stretch that because it is not the saint retained in the depth of it and that returns to the heart and that does not affect the thighs, more pause in it attracts, and departs from those views that were seen in the day.
If the search does not come to you, make a pause in the operating room of the infected wound as much as possible to avoid this that you want from the humidity; and make that the thigh lies over the wound so that it runs this that is in it adjusted.
If the wound has already been healed for three days or more and no spasm, trembling of the core, or stricture of the intestine occurs, and sometimes other good positions for the patient, you know that the wound is safe; and then cure that joint and the other curative care when it is healed.
If the cure of the patient is excused and it has been opened many times, you know that a fistula has already been made; then cure that joint for the good of the head.
If the wound is due to incarceration of gas or fluid, and it is simple on the surface of the skin or abdomen, you cure that joint as much as possible according to what is prescribed by suture, if it is large, or powder, if it is small.
If there has already been an inflammation in the bones, and it is now necessary to open the wound more deeply, you tighten the wound and extract those pus from it if they are separated. When the warts are not separated, you should clean them with a damp cloth to remove the pus, as the extraction of the warts is painful.
And if other pustules appear on the other parts of the body, the cure is the remedy that has been said.
Of the pustules of the belly.
The indisposition that occurs in the stomach is either large, small, or mixed.
And a small disruption is difficult to make with another hand, and if it is not easy to reduce them, then do not hesitate to insert them in their place as soon as possible, because the intestine will be difficult to engross.
And the better disruption is small, because in that case it is not difficult to reduce the intestine, as it is difficult in the special ones mentioned.
You know that the stomach suture is second to four fingers, and fewer stitches are common than those used in other wounds of the body.
Two other sutures are commonly used for other wounds, but they are not as common in the stomach suture.
I recommend that you consider each case and declaration.
If the wound is small and occurs due to the intestine being pressed by the abdomen, and it is difficult to reduce it, then you should use one of the four fingers: either to reduce the disruption caused by the compression as they have said, or when the intestine swells due to the coldness of the air.
And then if you see that the swelling is high, you should know that you should submerge it in water or in a mixture of water, squint, cyperus, and spice, and embrocation, until the inflammation is resolved.
And some people have seen that it has been treated with water alone, and it is better for the resolution of inflammation.
When you see inflammation being resolved, you must moisten the intestine with water in the area where it is swollen and red, as this will help reduce the intestinal blockage caused by little cause.
If the intestinal blockage is completely removed, you should cut the disruption with a small sharp instrument that has been used on unhealed embolisms.
The first cure is better when it is not cut and does not cause any trouble, and there is no need to be occupied in removing excess fluid or defecation.
The instrument is sharp and should be handled with care to avoid injury.
One side of the blade is sharp, and the other side is not sharp, and the tip is subtle, and it is not difficult to obtain a sharp point if it is not subtle.
When the abscess is enlarged and comes out of the body, you should make sure that its reduction follows the natural form of the intestine in the proper location, if possible, over there, as it is better.
If the disruption is wide and is located in the lower part of the abdomen, you should make sure that you place the cushion on the side of the patient's stomach and stop the movements of their legs; and if it is located in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should stop the movements of the patient's chest and hold their hands.
When it seems that the dislocation occurred in one of the two parts of the stomach, pause your attention and consideration for the moment in order to determine which part is affected and how severe the injury is.
And it is necessary that you administer this in great pain and in lesser pain.
In minor pain, pause the medicine that you have prepared, and apply it to your most sensitive parts, holding the dislocation tight with one hand and adjusting the lips of the wound, and withdraw it from that which causes another sutura if any.
This is the common suture method: one that grasps the string, according to the amount of the amplitude of the wound; and withdraws from the extremity of the dislocation of the said ring, and tightens the string one, other that you do not lose your position at the two ends of the chain, am the two ends of the cipher that you leave the chain of the parts of the intestine, until it penetrates into that part; and you have already added the two ends of the chain and the two ends of the cipher, and then make four orders.
If you tightly hold the double string around the thigh, and some of the knots are in certain parts of the thigh, and then add more beads and strings for decoration; and leave the rest of the string on that one, and tie it to the first bead as if it were the first knot of the thighbone; and do not stop until all the beads are tied in place.
If the beads are smaller between roughness and subtlety, four of the small beads should barely scratch the flesh; and the large ones are difficult to insert into the codpiece, and therefore it is necessary that they be both small and large.
It is not necessary that the bead be placed at the ends of the codpiece, because if the flesh is barely scratched and the thigh sweats before the consolidation.
The sutures are not prolonged for fear that the thigh may be prohibited from consolidating.
If you scratch the ends of the beads so that they do not hurt the patient's thigh, and place your hand over the sutures that expand the pulvis, which hold the ends of the beads; and leave them when you know that the thigh is consolidated.
When these kinds of sutures are made with needles in the hand, they are conveniently used for small wounds, as there is enough room in the suture for one or two needles or even around them.
The second source sentence can be translated as follows:
When the needle has penetrated these four extremities, reduce the needle of that metal part from which you began, so that the true vagina covers the subcutaneous part that was previously opened, so that the suture is the next suture of the cloth that the cloth you strengthened.
And pause between each suture the quantity of the large of the said needle.
And this suture sews the men.
And this suture sews the thigh, which was injured in a man in the abdomen, and was plagued with the plague of a palm, and was disrupted by the intestine around two palms of the intestine of the lower part of the body and was disrupted in the lower part of the member; and then you reduce that depressed that the intestine had been for the plague for 24 hours.
And the plague was consolidated in the space for 15 days or around, and was cured that one and is healed; and then it becomes weak for many years, and is discussed in its positions.
When the other physicians had failed to heal; and by miracle, that one who could not cure that ailment, who was in a place where there was no plague, nor any medicine, only praying over the sick person twice a day and drinking honeyed water from the healing fire, finally healed him.
I do not understand the context of this sentence. Please provide more information or clarify what you are asking.
And is that you understand the suture of the gallbladder, and enter through the hole from the side to the other side.
And so, when the needle enters the gallbladder and all the muscles, and you leave the end of the cyst where you inserted the needle; and make the other end of the hole from the other side of the finger pass through the same end of the cyst.
And when you have made it to go through that, then make it go through another way in the other end of the finger's cyst from the other side of the gallbladder; and leave the end of the cyst that is in this loop, and make the needle go through the other end of the part from the other side of the gallbladder.
When the penis is to be inserted into the vagina, it should be done in such a way that the entire penis enters the vagina until the end of the penis is completely inside.
Then, with the other hand, withdraw the penis from the vagina, extract the bullet from the uterus, and return it to the uterus in the same way as the other side of this extraction; and take out that from the uterus which is part of the penis.
And make another incision and another, and make another incision in proportion to what you have cut off according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is that you cut off the skin, which cuts off the hair, in order that you cut the vagina with one incision at the end of the uterus, and that the other incision is within the vagina when it is completely closed.
The second type of suture is the one that Guiela recommends, and this is for the purpose of preventing the vagina from being completely closed. And it is recommended by the physician that you cut a part of the vagina according to what the physicians cut, in order that the entire part be equal to the natural part; and the extremities of the other side are applied to the opposite extremity of the vagina, and this is done according to what I recommended to you.
When you fix the needle at the end of the thigh in your own hand, and make it pierce through the wound to that side, and let two ends of the cord; and then revolve the needle and make it pierce from the hole to the dint on both ends of the cord.
And then revolve those points, and make them pierce through the wound to the dint on both sides of the thigh into the space opposite to that you are in.
This suture is better than the common suture, and this suture of which I have previously recalled.
This is the sermon of Guillaume.
And may it be told to you that the abdominal suture is corrected by two needles, so that you enter them in each of them with a thread, and then begin with the introduction of your needle according to the one you have, and make it pierce through the other side according to the other sutures you have.
And you know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the abdominal cavity, it is difficult to perform the suture of that compared to the other parts of the abdomen.
The judgment of the medicine for the plague is made by the other plagues.
The cause of which is that when you manage to catch the recent plague in the flesh, and reduce the intestines and belly of that part and make them suitable for that occasion, then place your hand over that earth-like powder.
If the air has already altered the plague, then stop over the point where the wounds are located that cause you to present with hard stones and crack the bones, and they become solid and visible; and care for that plague as the cure of other plagues when it is healed.
If you do not have access to medicines, then stop over the point where the wounds are located that cause you to present with hard stones and crack the bones, as it begins to swell, bruise, and change the direction of those two veins, as you and your teacher have taught, when it is healed, so that you do not need another medicine in a timely manner when the plagues are simple.
If you fear that the plague spreads to the main limbs, then cover the wound with a piece of leather dipped in olive oil of good quality, or olive oil that is red, and place it on the circuit of the locations that are between the ankles and further to the knees.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in the intestines, then more veins will be affected, and you should apply the black stiptic ointment to that point, especially if perforation has occurred in the intestine and an exit penetrates into the cavity of the cavity.
You should know that the one that is of the large intestine is of lesser cure than that which is in the small intestines.
It is of difficult cure that when the one called "gout" does not receive plague from the blood that is in it, as it happens to all; and this is because of the great number of veins that are in it, and because of its magnitude, and because of its subtlety of nature, and because it is near to the nature of nerves.
If that is the case, then what you are doing about the blood is to reduce the intestinal contraction, and as a result, you should follow your own rectal method with the one that reduces the intestinal engagement.
If that space has already been passed and you have made the point on the location that is denigrated by it, then what you should do is strengthen that on the place where the flux of the pus comes out, because there are veins and arteries in the tissue.
And if you insert that which is another one, and pause the ends of the finger, and after leaving the source of the flux behind, so that over you there is no attraction of the pus, you must have the tightness of the tissue and the emission of the bile from the blood.
This line can be translated as "Rememberance of the plagues that happened in the intestine.
This line can be translated as "When a disruption occurs in the intestine and is small, it is possible that it can be restored in other people, because this was previously plagued in the upper part of the stomach by percussion with a flat object, and the plague was an old fistula and a sign of the management and ventilation.
This line can be translated as "And you continue the cure of the patient even if it was not confirmed in the hospital care, but stop subtleizing that which causes the fever and the location becomes solid.
This line can be translated as "And you said that I saw the location already solidified, time over the thighs that enveloped over the accident of the stomach; and did not encounter any other such accident and rammed in their disposable mouths eating and drinking, and then entered into a bath and was exercised in your words.
This line can be translated as "And it has been told to experienced patients that when the plague occurs in the intestine and is small, they believe that it is affected by this method: and that you take large needles; and adjust the lips of the plague and stop a needle from those that are in the mouth over the lips of the plague; therefore, when you cover them with your mouth, you split the head of the needle, which adheres and does not dissolve.
When another flea is not found nearby, and you do not stop making fleas until the entire amount of the plague is treated.
Then reduce that and treat the plague; and remove those attached to the intestine when the intestine is healed, and do not cause any harm to the thighs.
It is possible that the intestine has small hooks attached to it, which are of animal origin and are sharp; and it is because you hold the end of these intestinal threads, and they are dirty, and pull them towards the end of the flea thread, and enter them into the holes of that intestine, and reduce them in disruption.
This way of suturing fleas is only second to the trust and hope.
If the plague is large and wide, then if it is in one of the thin intestines, fewer hands are needed, and it is not cured by itself, and is not cured for the entirety.
When treating a wound and fistula, it is important to follow proper medical procedures to ensure the best possible outcome. Here is
When an ulcer or boil arises and does not heal quickly, and does not consolidate and does not get better over time, and does not abscess in any member of the body, it is universally called a fistula and is called that by doctors.
When a fistula is formed by nature, it is hard, white, and smooth, not causing pain but being in its natural state of congestion like labor pains; and for this reason, it is named after the part where it is located, that is, the buttocks.
It is in a wet part of the body, which causes itching; and soon the moisture is absorbed in some hours. Some of this moisture is thick, and it is scarce, and it is coarse.
When all those causes have been shown, and the knights of those and their cure in the division.
And cover that you pass to know the cure of the fistula which is made by way of operation, and I will tell you.
You know that fistula occurs in all parts of the body; four of them are fistulas that reach the veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the cecum, or the bladder, or the vesica, or to any part of the costal cartilages, or to any part of the spinal columns of the two, or to any part of the joints composed of the flesh and the foot; and those that bring proximity to the main member and resemble it.
And for that of these fistulas that follow this method is of the difficult diseases of poor cure, and does not receive cure, and occupation is given to that which is worked on and ignorance.
And if any of these fistulas has a depth that does not reach those places that I said, and you hope and trust in the cure of it, and you want to know it, then try to make it narrower with iron or steel, and if the fistula is made according to the right way, and ask for it from me.
If the fistula is twisted, investigate that which is attempted to be placed under subtle gentle pressure, for the pressure of the heart's levity in the body is alleviated and the tortuosity is curved.
If the fistula is very painful, it is not possible for you to understand what I mean about this attempt.
You are the one who has committed this horror upon yourself, for the water by which you cleanse that wound will spread to the others and affect them.
If you inquire with great care, which hand is possible for you to use if you have bones or nerves, and whether the cavity of the long or short fistula is affected, or if it is a fistula that causes such horror, and if it is a fistula that affects you with all your strength, with your endurance, with the endurance of the thigh, and with the intelligence and the accidents of the operation.
And when you have been over all those causes, you will see the cure according to confidence: and it is that you consider that if it is an apparent nearby fistula or in location, long from joint, or from nerves, or from arteries, or from veins, or from one of the parts which you say you have, you will consider.
When you have cleaned the fistula according to what is said about the narcotic of the patient, and removed that which is in that filtration and decayed carne, and that which is born in the birth canal of the carne, or of the thigh and semblance, and care for that part which is healed.
If the fistula is of long depth and follows the rectum, you should cover it as deeply as possible within the anus, and modify all of your corrupted carne; and administer enveloped needles into acute medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have understood with iron.
And let there be some wounds inside that the acute medicine damages all that is within the cavity of the fistulet due to corruption.
And restore those which engender healthy carne inside when it is healed.
If it is not cured by that, you should cauterize that according to what has been recommended.
If the cause of the fistula is known and you must certify this to the patient, then you should inquire about that and dry that second part which has been recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or main member as they have said.
If the bones are discovered and found to be corrupted and blackened, then you should immediately remove that part where the corruption is located; and properly treat that area with this remedy that I will apply inside where it is sick.
If the wound is not healthy and healing properly, you should know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of corruption; and then you discover the second part and carefully make the reason of it and the mollification of it with the same force as before, and then restore it.
And if it heals, then so be it; and if not, you should know that this corruption is in the depth of the chest, which has not been able to overcome, and therefore for you there is no other remedy than to let it be.
And if the bones are corrupted slightly, or you can remove it, you should know that you can remove it with soft tweezers that are used for this purpose.
And if those bones are very hard, you should carefully make the extraction of all of them, and of those that do not cause any problem to your strength.
If you have any contradiction with any cause of the humors, and in them there is no fear or mistake, you should insert those limbs or tendons here, and remove the bones.
If you do not have preparation of your bones for the operation, then place your hand over the wet plaster that can moisten the wet plaster on that, and let it enter where it is around the bones of the limbs and joints, and keep the wet plaster that is not yet consolidated, and tighten the cut that you have made in your operation.
If you fear, place your hand on the cotton submerged in olive oil or cotton submerged in Egyptian anointing oil or in a cup of cold vinegar, when those ligaments are inflamed and the bones are separated by the ablative, and those attractions are alleviated.
If it is a great bone that is like the bone of the camba or the thigh or the semblant, and that part of the bone is corrupted by the face of the bone so much so, then you should remove that only because that part is behind entered where it is left in that negro and corruption, and then restore the wet plaster.
If it is a great part that is corrupted by the bone, and the corruption has already reached the medulla of the bone, then you should cause the necessary closure of that and that totally inscribing in the location where the corruption has pervaded, and you cure that within which is consolidated.
I recommend that you attend to a man in his thighs, where there is a hernia, and assist in your operation with an assistant.
A young man, about thirty years old, suffered from pain in his thigh, and the cold humors that entered the matter of the body's core were over the material of the body's thigh, and it was a large gout, and there was no external cause for this.
When the focus extends over time due to the error of the doctors when the aposteme is hurt, and the matter moved, and the focus's care is properly paused after the hole in the fistula is made, and there are those orifices on it that all get affected by the cut and the humidity of the body.
And after many years, the focus learned nothing from those doctors, and he did not know in the art, until you were called.
And I saw the fistula and the matters that came out of it through those orifices, and that person's body was completely stiff and the color of his skin was yellowish.
And then you inserted your hand into one of those orifices and the tendon reached the bone.
And then you and I examined all those orifices and found that they all reached the bone of the fistula.
And then you held me and placed your hand over one of those orifices, and I saw a part of the bone inside, and it was already rotten and corrupted, and that part of the fistula was already corrupted inside when it had penetrated into the meat.

It is not necessary to repeat the operation of the patient and sectioning of the patient unless the disposition of the patient's body and the lack of tolerance of the patient and pain of the patient are taken into account, which causes the accident in all hours due to excessive evacuation without sinus mala.
And it is cured by whole treatment, and there is nothing in place of hard bones; and it is good that the body's position is in the heart of the chest and returns its virtue; and it is discussed in their positions and not made against the ambulance nor harm in any cause.
If the bones are prominent in the chest, you will know that you have succeeded with this second hand: and it is because you grip and stretch those at the extremity of those bones, and command all to extend those at their ends; and pause that sinew from the first sinew; and lay that sinew on the flesh that was left out of the bones, and extend the exit of the skin so that it reaches the parts left out, and you will discover the flesh over the place you want to sew so that the needle does not pierce the flesh.
When you stop the bone, that is, when you are about to operate, it is not forbidden to use a saw that does not harm the sound flesh.
And if the bandage is placed over the corroded part little by little, then if it is in the concavity of the corroded bone and does not appear at its appearance in the feeling, and forces the other wound to be sealed.
And if the bones are corroded and not prominent, then continue the incision on the other side, and the corrosion is in the inner part or at the end of the part; and then stop the blood flow, and continue the suture of the first incision where the corrosion enters as long as the suture of the other incision is continued.
And if the suture is made according to the location of the corrosion as described.
And if the corrosion is at the joint, make an incision on that corroded joint and suture the bones that continue from the other part.
And if the corrosion is in the continuation of several joints, you should not be in this reason but rather engage.
And if the corrosion is in the shoulder of the arm or foot, it is very difficult; however, if you ask the corrosion where it appears to you and cut it, and bend it according to each disposition that is possible for you, and then engage to correct it for you, when it does not oppose veins or nerves.
You should know that the type and size of the screws and inserts for these bones depend on the situation of the bones, as well as their preparation, thickness, size, and fineness; so that you can prepare for all types of operations with appropriate instruments for that operation.
You know that this operation means for you on the specific of the instrument that you ask; when you have great skill and long experience in the handling of this art, and witness of handles of various diseases, where you already have the avies by your meatys according to what is convenient for you from the sturmentz in all disease.
And you should know in the end of this chapter the number of the instruments which you will use as simple as possible and according to which you will proceed for your prohibition that you will experience on others. Form of seal:
Another form of seal:
Another large form of seal:
Form of ray: The head of this ray should be according to the form of the star-like cap, and its points should be according to the form of the steel points.
And it does not seem but that those are confuted with the heads of the joints when they are corrupted, or is the mouth very wide.

In English, it could be translated as: "Another type of cutting tool that resembles a ray, with a sharp edge and is displayed in various locations in the bones." However, without more context, it's difficult to provide a more accurate translation.
The first line of the text translates to: "The shape of the bone that is perforated by the bones:".
When the end of the body is triangular and sharp-pointed.
When iron of India is used, it seems that all the causes that have been said of razors and scissors and of knives.
Of scissor ends and the cutting of bones.
The ends can be smeared either by intrinsic or extrinsic cause, or as you have treated that corruption by curing with those medicines and the cure not being effective, sometimes the corruption has to leave the member that does not cut for any cause, it seems that you have inscribed that member in this way to avoid the evil of death or malice that is greater than the defilement of the member.
And the sign of that which happens is that the member is made black inside because it is what burns, or it can be smeared with the blackness inside that presses on that member which receives all the body and takes hold of it; and therefore you have inscribed this member.
And it seems that if the cause of corruption is the pressure of some venomous causes, such as from the sting of a scorpion or a wasp or a bee and similar ones, then...
If corruption or pressure is at the end of this, you should insert it into the body and not leave space for the corruption to enter the wound.
When it comes to the matter of entering the body, you should insert your hand into the anus, and do not leave any space for corruption to enter when you grasp the thigh bone of the leg.
If that is the case, then insert your hand into the arm within the joint of the elbow.
If the corruption passes through another joint and the elbow is turned around, then in that case the death of the thigh occurs; and it is necessary to administer another cause or another remedy to maintain the cure in sufficient quantity.
When corruption occurs in the foot, as it does in the matter of the foot, you should insert your hand into that within one of the nails.
If you grasp the sole of the foot, then you should insert your hand into the entire foot. If it is possible to enter the nail, then insert your hand into the joint of the nail.
If corruption has already reached the nail, then in that case it is not possible to save it but to release the thigh and let it die.
The first source sentence to translate:
When it is necessary to cover a wound with dry cloth that does not touch the place where it should be, and postpone the application of the dressing until the injury is healed and the swelling is reduced.
If you happen to cut yourself while working, it is recommended to cauterize the wound immediately or apply some powder to close the cut; and then return to your treatment once it is complete.
And apply the affected member with a suitable remedy, and cure it when it is healed.
I recommend that you go to a doctor in the city, as this accident happened to me and I have reported it, which is similar to the one you mentioned, which was caused by the ignition of fire in the city.
And that corruption first occurred in the city entrance, when it touched the entire foot.
And then that man prepared himself for the accident by applying a remedy to the affected member with great force and speed, and the pain and burning sensation subsided, and the foot was healed.
This is a complex medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. The text seems to be discussing various medical procedures and treatments for different ailments. Here's a line
This line seems to be saying: "And then it happens to me, and I have perforated the superfluity that was placed over the body of medicine, the worlding of its face; and it is not perforated by the superfluity and begins to go to another dit entered that began in the body.
When the fatty substance of the patient's body is inserted into his body, and you do not want to expect anything about the reception of that superfluity, and rather than fearing the insertion of the fatty substance of the patient's death, which was overwhelmed by laziness.
And I thought that it would die for me, it returns to its earth and comes to me that the man prepared and inserted his fat into his body, and he became healthy.
I have not written this narrative except because it is an assistant over this matter and that it has a significant meaning and is followed by the following one.
For the care of this and the quality of the clerosis with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in the fleshy parts of the body and the space of the abscess is prolonged because it collects waste, and it bursts and perforates and expels the waste, and the location is cut off as if it were a vein, and the stitch that is removed from it is like a fine thread, and no corruption is found in it, and it is not pressed on the bone or nerve or limb, it is called an abscess, and it is not a fistula.
When however the space is extended within which corruption presses on some member, it is called a fistula and we do not know.
The cure of the patient is to sit in that position as it revolves, and especially when it becomes subtle and appears as a knot, and conforms to the place for its corruption, without adhering to the location.
If you hope that the knot adheres and that corruption does not follow by subsequent consequence, and if there is much face in the knot, then you treat that with a clister.
And is it that you consider the sinus, and if it is large, and the brace that you use is of sweet odor, then you treat that with an Egyptian ointment which is of oil and vinegar and zinc received in parts equal, and are adjusted on the focus within which the medicament is made to flow and pervade a certain part of honey.
And then take hold of it that is necessary and dissolve the water and honey; and clisterize in that the sinus, and strengthen the outlet of it, and lay the medicament on it for the number of hours you wish.
When extracting that piece of gold; and do this for several days until the sinus is softened and the skin is moistened.
When certain veins are filled with ash of coal, when you do not present this medicine to the patient; and that is when you take the coal from the fire, and put water over it, and then close it with that and fill it in where you confess that the intestine is out.
If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash of coal, then close that water and mix honey with oils, and then close it with the same honey mixture that has the property of cleaning and washing, and the vessel adheres to the intestine, and especially when you see excessive slippiness and dryness.
And when you make water for certain veins and you confess that the intestine is already rough, then close that water and make it stronger to make the flesh in it.
And that is when you take some ointment and dissolve that oil rose and see the stitching; or that you close that water with some ointments and other ointments that have the properties which I have written in the book of ointments.
If the orifice of the sinus is straight in which no cannula of the clostridium is received, then you should widen it a little bit at a time, and stop when it is enveloped in Egyptian cotton or Basilicon earth, after it has been widened.
If the orifice is widened, then you should add the lips of the suture and cut off the quantity that is between the clostridium and its addition.
If the orifice of the sinus is elevated to the parts below it, then you should dry that in the basal location where the gut runs away from there, because when the gut is cut at the beginning of the sinus, the flesh will be in the generated cavity.
If you cannot dry the sinus within the environment of the bone, then you should perforate that which you prepare for the member according to what you see and according to what is not retained in the sinus by the gut in any way.
Whatever is on the sinus opening, which remains in place for the entire time that it does not fit well with the bracelet. And to know if the pain is due to the bracelet being too tight or not enough, or if it is not causing any pain at all.
And do you consider the location of that sinus, if in it the patient feels pain or not, and if it is inflamed.
And when your treatment is prolonged in that manner, and you see the material that was applied to the sinus opening adhering, or if it adheres well, do you keep the dressing on for the day or change it the next day, and when you remove the plaster, do you change the dressing for another and renew the engagement.
If the duct is properly placed under the skin, there should be no difficulty in adhering to it, for the customary treatment of the patient will be appropriate, and in those where the fatigue of the body is evident in the latter part of life, and in those where the opposite is true.
If the duct is not properly placed under the skin and causes indigestion, you will understand that the duct does not adhere; and if the adherence of the duct is delayed and is prolonged, you will adjust the medicine according to its dryness, and if the medicines are humid in their substance and in their virtue, they become as dry as leather when adjusted, with an excess of addition of seeds.
And the more severe the disease is that you are treating, the more likely it is that you will find diafinicon and it will be dissolved in olive oil, and it will be over the wound of the gullet in its substance, and you will comfort that part with that, and use that.
And it seems to have effect in that action, when there is no indigestion and diafinicon is found, and when the gullet is filled with that, and you use it; or when you take mirra and aloe and enseal it in the oil that is over the fire, and pour it over drap and strengthen it on that, and pour it over the duct that has been filled with that, and enseal it.
When some women are treated with long-term and proper aristocratic care (and lilies of the valley), flour, and centaurea, and use those simple or adjusted ones, twist them, pull them out, and sprinkle them on the milk that I have recommended; and rest.
If the sinus is prolonged and not cured by this treatment, you know that corruption is in the preon of the patient, and an investigation is made in the bones or in other hard bones or ligaments; then you treat the patient with a curative catheter, as it is said.
Of the cure of a pumice and worn-down nails and addition of a digit cut and section.
Pumice is applied to the nails that are worn down and do not have the nail polish on the toe or foot, and it is less used in other parts, and when it is prolonged and the cure is not successful, or it is postponed by an application of cauterization or corrosion, or it becomes corrupted, and it enters within that corroded nail polish, and it is very corrupted throughout, and it pervades its corruption into the bone that is entered with the smell of the odor, and the extremity of the toe is made, and the color of the nail becomes black.
When you have that cold humor that they have spoken of in division and does not satisfy your curiosity, then cover yourself with iron that you are fully armed against the unclean superfluity that arises from the body and properly cauterize the wound as much as possible, for cauterization is useful in this case.
If the bones are healthy and the addictions of the bones want to consume the parts that you pierce with points, and they continue to push and pierce the bone that you have pierced with the point, and insert it and close it with ease, and stop there where it is comfortable; and properly care for that cold humor that remains.
If corruption has already settled in the bones, then cover that you have pierced the bones and the extremities, for no time is ever healed when it is in those corrupted bones.
And if sometimes the corrosion and corruption arise in the place, then you should insert it in one of the nostrils according to what is recommended for its remembrance, and properly care for that so that it is healed.
When pain is felt in the thigh at the groin, and the pain becomes very intense, it is necessary to cut the labia majora, and then cleanse the groin with saltwater or a scrub, and keep guard that the cut does not enter into the flesh that you have just exposed, so that when you apply painful pressure to the thigh, the cause of the excessive flesh in that place is not due to natural growth in that location; and then care for that area with what gives relief from pain.
When the flesh is tight, which is natural in most men, too much flesh is found, or too much bone, or too much fat.
And the flesh of the thigh is born in the joint, or is the birth of the thigh from the flesh of the legs. And that which is born in the legs' flesh is not bad, but that which is born in the joints is very bad.
And of those that are born with excessive flesh, the cut is easier, and it is necessary to make the cut with saltwater or a scrub.
When someone is born with joint pain, the treatment is difficult; therefore, keep away from the abscess of it.
In that which is born with the nose, it is necessary that you insert your hand into the flesh of the patient as far as the bone, and then press on one of those convenient points with a sharp point, and cure the part that is diseased.
Less consolidation occurs when the parts between them move or are born of the patient, or due to the consolidation of plague or combustion of fire, or by appearance, therefore, it is necessary that those parts return to their natural form.
And stop between them the enfuses in red oil so that they are not consolidated too much, and separate between them, or pause between them a thin layer of plum under that it is consolidated after that it is necessary.
And if there is appearance of consolidation in the parts of the palm, then you dry that consolidation according to what is prepared and convenient for the figure of the member.
When there are many wounds, they are called varicose veins.
Varicose veins are called varicose veins, and they are thick, full of melancholic superfluities that flow through the limbs of the body, and are most common in the legs, and most commonly in the legs of itinerants and laborers and beggars.
It is said that you administer purification of the heart of black blood through some veins that are expelled forcefully, and that blood is taken from the basilica vein.
The cure of them is secondarily made by two methods: one is to inscribe and cut that black sin, and the other hand raises the vein and extracts all of it.
The incision of the vein is made according to this method: first, apply the forceps to the beginning of the limb, and when the sin is resolved, which is fetid from the limb, and tightens the limb, stretch the limb from the end of the thigh to the end of the denile with a bender, and squeeze the vein in a place, or in two, or in three, and make a wide section, and raise the black sin above the end of the limb within it, and leave it in juice, when the sin is reduced to the quantity that you want and the times that you need, and it will be tolerated by the virtue of the limb.
When you apply the remedy, and command him not to eat black bile-producing foods.
Continue the treatment with leeching when the veins are full and notice the pain in the affected area.
Follow this procedure: you raise the leg, if it's painful, and place a pillow under it, then embrace the leg with your arms and massage the hindquarters of the animal, or if you can't reach it with your hands, enter the member that is lame.
And cut the tendon on the right side of the vein to notch it at the long or short end, or at the base of the foot, you need to remove the knot.
And open the tendon with an uncinate saw and excise the vein completely where it appears in the sensation, and you must see the appearance of the vein that sometimes turns black.
And when you remove the tendon, you notice that the white string is a cord.
And then you place your hand behind that which is raised and swollen from the knee, and hold onto that with one of your fingers.
And then cut that section for three times, and scrape the skin from the affected area inward, from the vein that appears there.
And then raise that and insert it into the rear section of the foot, and extract that and raise it within which is soft for the second section, and extract that from the section that is over it.
And then put it inside that which is extracted from the section that is swollen or has pus from all sections, and then insert it into that.
And if it does not obey your orders to extract and raise, then insert a needle firmly and doubled and tie it to that and extract it, or insert the thumb and turn your hand around the whole part where it is swollen. And be careful that it is not inserted; if it is cut, it will be difficult to raise that hand and it will come over the thigh for that wound.
When the entire wound is out, place yourself over the location of the dressed wound that is submerged in vinegar and unvinegarized oil, and treat that within which is healthy.
If the joint is obstructed by a winding quality that envelops all parts, and there is no straight path after that, then you should know that you should apply points on that entire winding of the joint and the locations of its encircling, and suspend them in such a way that they are raised above where they were originally.
And keep in mind that you have not yet inserted the vein and it does not cause any problems for you to raise it; and use your prudence in this.
The form of the incision made on the joint is:
It is not the acuity of the point that causes it to pierce as sharp as a needle, and with its great rigidity, if it were subtle, it would pierce the vein with its sharpness; there is an excessive grossness in the point as they have said.
Extraction of the thigh vein.
This vein is generated in the legs of lowlands as in the Ategi in Arabic lands and in the low, dry lands of India with little fertility and without grass or shrubs.
When the pain is produced in other parts of the body than those mentioned above, other measures should be taken.
The treatment of the wound is one of putrefaction that I see coming from the back, as if venomous serpents and toads and scorpions and earthworms are being generated between the back and the flesh.
The susceptibility to the occurrence of the wound is due to this vein that happens in the flesh that is inflamed with great intensity; and the place is swollen; and the vein begins to appear there from the location of that vesicle which seems to be growing from the plant.
And when the wound reaches its end, you must cover it with a cloth of the size of a dragon's foot, which is the foot of a dragon. Enter into it, and notch that and let the blood hang down from the swelling.
And so many veins as you see coming from the wound, cover them with blood and notch that. And if it is prolonged, cover one part of the wound and let the blood flow around; and do not cover that if it is outside, but if you cover it, insert it into the flesh and let it adhere to the carn and cause apostema and puncture in the place and ulceration bad.
When the affected part is swollen and needs to be extracted gradually, it should be removed from the body as soon as possible, without causing any further harm to the body.
This vein is found in many men who have a long length of their palm and fingers, and I have already seen one that is twenty palms long.
If it is inserted during the time of medication, introduce the ray into the tube and pierce the long tube through the chest to the heart, then remove all that is in the matter, and administer putrefaction to the place for several days with medicines; and care for it as part of the cure for apothecarys.
This vein has some ramps, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, it often causes damage to that orifice, and it is found in many other orifices.
And treat that as has been said in the division and as has been said here.
From the section of the superior veins generated under the skin and it is called bovine agony.
This disease is called by the name of the cow because of the movements that are seen in the belly and which are few in number, and it affects all parts of the body, and is shown to the feeling of the patient of the members entering the belly and disrupting the codena and coming out.
And the generation of the child is due to putridity of certain humors that consist of worms, snakes, and tapeworms, as well as fleas and lice in the intestines.
When the patient is afraid of the magician, for when he comes into the body and rises to the head, and goes into the brain, then much weight is placed on him and enters and destroys the brain, and then many wild motions follow.
Then when you want to cure that and remove it, you should not do so without the aid of the ambulatory and appearance of the organ in the body, and then cover that which is over it and that which is further away from it with strong constraints, and then dry it over it and extract that.
And if it is pressed into the flesh and does not come out, then you should stop using cauterization with fire on the spot where it hurts, and the main cause that frightens us is corruption of the part in which the part corrupts the place as they have said.
If you see that it has come to the head of the brain, then cover that with a strong constriction over the swelling, and dry it over it and extract that; and cover that this is used for the improvement of the healthy body by means of medicines eliminating putrid humors, and keep away from things generating putrefaction.
The given line "De sectione super aegritudinem nafir" is a Latin phrase that can be translated to English
This disease is common in our land, and it causes pain in various parts of the body, and it spreads from one part to another.
When you have already seen that which I previously recommended to you. A man was called to attend a woman in a village, and he found that her arm was swollen and there was a small inflammation in the vein of the arm, and he left it for an hour, and the inflammation disappeared as if silver were being poured into this, although he did not say whether it was or not, as if silver were being poured into this place.
And then the pain in that place remained and settled in the muscle, and it stayed for about an hour.
And he corrected the other arm so that it did not cause pain in the other arm.
And I advise you to roll over so that the entire body is on the other side that you saw; and it is too wonderful how the exchange of the limbs and the speed of the members from one member to another. When you had seen that in the best parts of the body, there were many that could not endure the exchange of members from member to member. I have not seen that in the limbs as in the woman.
I did not know that it was so until I saw that the woman was old, with many corsets and visible veins, and in this case, there appeared to be a change in the sensation of that windiness.
It is necessary that this retro-curacy does not appear in those who are delicate and have corsets made of smooth veins.
And when you want the curacy of him, and the patient feels that pain, then do not appear to you as if it has been done as they have said, then strengthen over that and after him the intestine and press on that side that is inside that which is the one with that changed windiness, and cauterize the place.
If you do not see the wounds in those parts, then you perform the cure of the corset and the air that expels windiness and carminatives of the pills made from saffron and serapin and similar ones.
Extraction of sage.
Sage is diverse according to the species and the locations on the body where it is plucked, which diversity is that of those that have large points, and small, concave, and narrow ones, and solid ones; and of those that have three angles, and of those that have tongues; and of those that have stars.
When the symptoms of the serpent's venom are seen in the patient, and the bones pass through the skull, and the cyphac which is over the brain, where it happens due to the heat of the serpent's venom, causes inflammation, vertigo, and fainting, and spasm in the limbs, and swelling and inflammation of the tongue, and spasm and paralysis of the intellect, and vomiting of bile, and the word is separated from the tooth and the mouth is destroyed, and the place of the wound becomes moist white-like polls, and there is a sign of death at the opening, then you know that the serpent's venom has caused death.
If you see these symptoms appear in the patient, then avoid the cure and extraction of the gallbladder, unless it comes out.
If the gallbladder pain is felt in the abdomen, so that it seems to be located in the left side of the pelvis, and there is no cause for concern; and if the movement of the gallbladder resembles the movement of a finger, and the color of the pus is black, and there is coldness in the extremities, and sweating, and constipation; then you know that death is near.
And when the gallbladder has caused the lung to swell with sinusoidal pus, and the vessels that are closest to the colon are affected, and the color of the thigh changes, and the spirit is expelled in large amounts, and there is an attraction for air, then you know that death is near.
And if the gallbladder is located in the abdominal cavity that is closest to the chest, and the pain is felt in the small costal bones, and a great amount of forceful pain and breathing is caused, and not all the muscles are affected, then you know that death is near.
If the sage is in the stomach, then you must take a large dose of the medicine for the food that is not digestible in any way.
If the sage is in the stomach and gets stuck there, or if a fever or intestinal obstruction occurs, and there is no hope for the extraction of the sage, then...
If the sage is in the bladder and there is a lot of urine with a foreign body, and the cause of the foreign body is not known, and the pain is severe in the thighs, then you should know that it is fatal.
The other parts of the body are similar to the face, neck, and shoulders, as well as the spine, vertebrae, and joints, and the kneecap, and they are saved second to the major dispositions when the sage does not obstruct the vein or artery and is not venomous.
And you advise me to tell you about the appearance of these sages for the cure of this disease.
This cause is, for in a man there was a swelling on the side of his nose, and you extracted it from another part, then the gray of the bone of his nose, and it became healthy and did not cause any harm to the nose.
And you extracted another swelling from a Jew's side that was swollen in the hard part of the ear, then the eyelid was pushed back, and the swelling had already been hidden and was not found by anyone else except for a small part attached to the ear tip, and it was a large swelling among the acute swellings of the Turks, and it had a leon's head in which there were no aurelhas.
And the Senate was the Jew, and it did not cause any harm to the ear.
And you extracted another swelling from a Crestian man who had a swelling in the groin, and it was an Arab swelling, and that was the one with the aurelhas; and then you inserted it between two fingers, and it was submerged in the groin of him; and then you subtly touched it, and extracted it, and it became healthy for the Crestian.
When another gentleman was brought to me who had been hanged in the belly, and I thought he would not live for that; and therefore, after thirty days, I found that he had not moved over the belly at all, covering the gentleman and examining the case, and he was cured, and there was no accident from this.
I saw another man who had bitten a woman on the buttocks, and the plague was solidified on it, and after five years, the woman was in labor and the child was born.
I saw a woman who had bitten a man on the belly, and the plague was solidified in it, and she did not change her dispositions in regards to men, and the woman did not bleed in any of her natural functions.
I saw another man who had bitten a woman on the face, and the plague was solidified in it, and the woman was consolidated, not bleeding here, and there was no sign of pain or suffering.
I extracted the woman from the man of the princes of the king who had been hanged in the nose hole of the head and had already passed away at the end of a little part, and the entire woman was hidden.
When you were called to attend to the patient's case, it took three days for the swelling of the leg to subside.
Then you examined the leg for plague, and then you inquired about that subtle thing, but did not feel it, but rather, I felt a sharp point further down, and then I wondered if that point was at the end of the leg.
Then I examined the area where it was most painful, where there is an attractive and digestive attraction, confident that this place is where you appear to the leg, because it passes over that.
And I did not find any significant accident in the accidental location where you obtained that place; and you continued to examine it over there for several days and no more accidents occurred, and the plague was consolidated in the meantime, and the leg of the extremity of the thigh was recovered in several days after I felt the leg rise up and come back to me.
Then you stopped treating the acute, corrosive medicine for several days until it burned, and you applied it to the point, and I examined that, and I removed the subtle end of the leg from the fist, which adhered to the finger.
When I saw the plague in its early stages and this medicine was introduced, it became visible that the end of the tail was affected, and it took me four months to treat it.
I realized that the plague was amplified and I could enter the forceps into it and remove them, and I did not stop subtlety and inventing over that, when I began to use the forceps to extract the forceps from the end of the head, following which the form of those at the tip of the capillary appeared; and I restored the plague.
The doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose was not restored, and you restored it and the plague was consolidated, and the patient was healed for the whole body, and there was no recurrence in that cause.
I recommend to you the quality of extracting some tails that pauses this rule and has significance about it that I have not said, that is, the parts of this article and the definitions of that are not understood in the narrative or not comprehend those free.
The surgeon wisely compares the few about this matter; and I say that what is present is absent, and the new operation and the new instrument need the descent of the causes outside the art when it happens.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
When a part of the body is pierced by something that enters it, or if it is caused by a wound in the flesh, it is then called a wound.
If it does not obey the time specified in the hour, then you should lay it for several days until the flesh that is around it becomes hard and the attraction of the wound and its exit is over.
If it remains in the bone and does not obey your time, then you should continue to lay it for several days and wait for the attraction and motion of that part to occur each day, and it will eventually be outside.
If it does not obey your time for several days, then you should continue to lay it until you perforate in the circuit of the wound in that bone of all part that is needed to be amplified by the wound and extract that part.
If the saddle is already causing discomfort in the location of the body and the sentiment, you should investigate that force, and if you feel it, then aim at that force with the sharp cautery points that are suitable for the attachment of the saddle.
And if you cannot reach it due to the constraint of the plague and its length, and there are no nerves or veins here, then you should apply pressure on the plague when it is amplified and it is possible to remove the saddle.
And if it is held by the hairs that are in it, then you should cut the flesh where it is fixed with all the force that can be done; and do this, if you cannot reach the escape of the flesh from the fracture of the horns and in the twist of those that obey.
When you are performing the extraction of the gallbladder in any location where it is, you use a tie with your forceps on all parts that pass through the sageta; and subtly as possible, to make sure the gallbladder is not torn and is easily attached to your difficult extraction and to that extraction.
And if you cannot do that on that day, you must rest for several days until the parts that are in the circuit of the gallbladder are dry, and then it will be easier for you to do that. If you have any opposition to the flow of blood, you should administer what has been said about the cure in the capital city.
And keep your virtue of incision of veins or nerves, or cords, and manage the engagement of all your hands in whatever way you can to prevent the gallbladder from escaping; and make it easy, tranquil, slow, and firm as possible.
And when you make the gallbladder contract so that the patient's thighs are in the position according to the figure according to which you have to reduce the gallbladder in it, which is less painful. If this is not possible for you, then administer this remedy as best as you can using the figures.
However, if the sutures that were made outside the opposite side or any other part are causing discomfort due to the part being pulled too tightly from the previous incision and sometimes causing it to slip off, then you should cut over that area; and make the cut as long as the number of forceps used is; and then pull it out, so that it becomes less tight.
If it is held tight in the bone, then you should twist the thread according to the opposite direction as the suture presses on the bone, and increase the tension, and then extract that part.
And continue that for a few days, and repeat it as needed.
If the end of the suture is exposed, then you should pull on that part.
If the end of the suture is cut and needs to be administered with pressure, then you should insert that part, if it is obstructed, stretch it so that it fits between the concavity of the bone and the suture and pull on that part.
If the hip is hollowed out, then you should push firmly into that area with your hand, until the hip is pushed back into its place.
If the hip is intoxicated, then you should cover the entire flesh in which it is located, as much as possible, and apply care to that area as necessary, according to what is appropriate.
If the hip is inflamed in the chest, or in the belly, or in the vesica, or on the side, and it is near that which you touch with your hand, and it is possible for you to apply pressure over that area, then you should apply pressure over that area and guard against veins or nerves, and extract that part, and if necessary, cleanse that part and care for it as it heals.
Form of forceps used to hold the hips:
The ends of them are like the beak of a bird, which are sharp when we hold onto the hip to prevent it from being hurt.
And those are special movements, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity of the size of the hip and the narrowness of the waist, and the width of the wound, and the constriction of the part.
This line appears to be discussing the application of pressure on a certain part of the body, possibly the foot or ankle. Here's a possible translation:
This line seems to be discussing a type of surgery related to veins. Here's a possible translation:
This line appears to be discussing various types of veins in the body, including those related to the face, mouth, and throat. Here's a possible translation: This line seems to be discussing different types of veins in the head and face area. Here's a possible translation:
In the foot and leg there are three veins; one of those is that which is farthest from the curvature of the wild deer's thigh; the second is the sciatic vein, its location being further from the domestic deer's thigh; the third is the sciatic vein as well, its location being further from the wild deer's thigh. In the leg there are other veins similar to those.
The beauty of the veins that are closest to the anus is catarrh, anorexia, emigration, and ulcers of the old head.
And the quality of saging those is second only to what I recommend to you: it should be shaved around the head of the thigh, and shaved around the head of the thigh in the occipital region in the location of the veins that are wide enough for good friction; apply pressure to the thigh with a needle entering where the pores and openings of those hairs are located, as you said, and if you feel the hands of those you said, here try.
When you hold the harpoon, and it happens to be the one that is stuck, and then you insert that part of the vein into the codpiece where that flesh meets the bone, which is about to encounter the bone. Then raise your hand and pull the vein and the codpiece apart, and insert the vein where you previously inserted it. And is the length of the insertion two thirds or less? And so does the sac as much as you want.
Then tighten the pulleys and pull it out as soon as it is healed.
And previously, at the beginning of the freeing, make an incision and cauterize those parts.
More of the arteries and veins that are used by the templars for the flesh-cutting operation are ancient, evil, and often causing excessive bleeding from sharp, abundant vessels.
And the quality of flesh-cutting those is second to what you recommend to me: tighten the thigh, and when the veins appear in sensation, make a clear observation of their appearance and the end of their hands, and try to understand it.
When you have raised the navel away from the vein and placed it on the desired spot, introduce the incisions of the blade that you have made beforehand, and raise the vein; and insert them in the same way as you have done in the other veins; and let them run along the amount of your need.
And if you have separated the abdominal muscles, and placed the said on the vein for an hour, and then on the thigh, pulverize and powder that part which is most constrained, and let it be removed when it is healed.
And if you have previously remembered the incisions and those that were made, and attracted them at the beginning of the free movement.
And the benefit of flebotomy on the vein of the face is that the flebotomy on the cephalic is useful for the old wounds of the face, and for the migraines, and the rigidity, and the ulcers.
And the quality of the flebotomy is according to what you recommend to me; so it is that the abdominal muscles constrain the use of the part which appears to be the vein; and hold the instrument which is called the forceps of which this is the form of you.
Pause the point that is on the top of the fossa over the vein and covers it with your hand or another cause in the hand of the patient, and leave it to run according to the quantity you want; and remove the incision of the thigh and strengthen that enters when it is healed.
If some incisions are made by sharp forceps, but not because the flebotomy is at the tip as with the others, it should be at the end, and the flebotomy should be made on the second transverse, where the bones are placed and easily cut in the flebotomy when subtle.
The beauty of the two veins that are the lacrimal veins of two eyes for the scalp of the eyes for the scars and boils in the eyes, and the wounds of the face.
And the quality of the flebotomy is that the thigh stretches the collar so that it is not a needle, and the flebotomy is made on those, and you should stand over the head of the patient.
When the cut is made along the transverse axis of a short length of flesh, and in the place where there is no flesh; and if the cut is made very thin, then the end of it is often cut.
And let the blood flow as much as is necessary, and stop over those points, and press them with a needle, and then remove them.
Moreover, the cuts made on the nose of the vein are equivalent to acute fever and violent sweating, and to the diseases of the face and eyes, and the weakness that occurs in the face, and especially when it is old.
And the quality of the cut on the thigh is that it stretches the cheek and holds the nose close to the left side, and takes the points subtly long and places them in the right place of the corner of the nose, where the vein does not appear, and where the sinus begins to flow the most.
Cover that you last made the cuts on the thigh very small and let the blood flow according to your need; and take it with a needle, where it is restored gently.
The following text is a medieval medical treatise written in a language that is somewhat similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish and French as well. I will try to guess what the text means and translate it line by line into English:
The quality of the fleshotomy of those is that the patient's leg becomes stretched in front of each; and the artificer should be over the top of the patient's thigh, and the thigh should be placed on a pillow.
The fleshotomy should be made along the vein as little as possible; and the second sand should be extracted according to the quantity or second time that is needed to be taken; and it should appear like another vein.
And remove the limb and stretch the other veins in a stricture that the patient is not distracted, and let the blood enter into the matter where the plague is healed.
The advantage of the fleshotomy of the veins is that it relieves small postmatura and pustules of the mouth, corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers in the nose and in the circuit of the patient.
The quality of the fleshotomy of those is that it stretches the patient's leg, and stretches the thigh of the patient with a knife, and rotates the lips of the patient and looks at the other veins of which one is of the left lip and the other of the right; and the demonstration of each is by the black of each tooth, and it is less in the circuit of those narrow black veins; and then insert each in an inscription in an inscription.
If you doubt that further, and do not know which one it is, then understand the majority of them, and the manifest symptoms of those.
When it appears that the veins are swollen in the lips.
It is customary to use the flebotomy of the head for the lips, tongue, and throat.
The quality of flebotomizing those is that it follows the throat between the teeth and lifts the tongue, and looks at the tongue from one vein and another vein, and the color of each is darkened to black.
And then flebotomize each one; and keep in mind that you do not cut the veins, but leave them behind when flebotomizing those, as they are arteries.
And your veins that are flebotomized in the lips are customary for all men, and the flebotomy of them is made with two hands, or with a mirror held at a distance, or with a small magnifying glass; or with a mirror held close, and this is the form of it:
This sentence seems to be discussing the appearance of the fleabite and the need to open the veins that are full and appear to be large, as well as those that contain dark, thick blood.
This sentence seems to be discussing the smaller size and subtle tip of the fleabite, as well as its similarity to a subtle vein that contains a subtle amount of citrus.
This sentence appears to be discussing the advantage of fleabite on the basilica vein, which is one of three veins: it extracts the poison from the maladies that cause the groaning and the pain in the chest, and from there it leads to the heart.
This sentence seems to be discussing the role of the fleabite-remover when they fleabite that vein, which guards against it and is overwhelmed by it, as it has an artery there, and if it errs and adjusts in the puncture of the fleabite, it will cut that artery and cause a flow of poison, so that they do not fleabite that vein again, but rather cut it as they cut the other veins.
If the basilica does not appear manifestly, you should cover that and move to the other, or surround around some ram you have; or make incisions in place of the end of the arm, where that is manifest; and cut that as it appears, and secure it as they have said.
If you wish to perform a hysterectomy on the patient, you should cover the stricture of the arm that touches the location entered where the location of the fingers is, and place it over it as needed; and then cut the arm and cut the vein in a concave manner as described; and make sure that you do not hit the percussion in any space of the artery location.
And when you see that the limb is stretched, inflammation occurs in the location where you have touched, and this inflammation is inflammation of the artery, so it swells.
And if you see that the wound flows in the hysterectomy as if it were from a child's ear, and this wound is a subtle rogue, you should know that it is from the artery; and then cut and pause the point said over that for a long space; and after that, if the wound separates, five more will separate, and you should tighten the arm and pull out that.
And guard the mourning of the wound and be over-fearful of it and do not worry that for a few days after it is healed, it will not hurt you.
If the wound does not heal, and sometimes you do not have access to medical care for this, then you should insert the artery, if it appears to you; or that the extremity of the same is contracted, and the sacced becomes separated; or that you take an old piece of bandage, and apply it there, and hold it tightly over the location of the vein that is strictured, and the pulvis enters into the other day.
If the wound heals, then so be it; and if not, you should care for that one of which there are preceded memories of the location of the sacceds coming out of the powders.
The difficulties in opening the wound of the sacced are due to the location of the small plague and the possibility of the pulvis of the arm.
More often than not, the fleubotomy is beneficial for extracting the sacced from the upper part of the head and to the lower part of the chest; therefore, it is composed of ram of the basilica and ram of the cephalica, as they have said.
When the surgeon approaches the area of anxiety during the incision of the surgery, it is a nerve; and if he adjusts in the puncture of the incision and paralyzes the nerve, it will cause the patient's stupor, and it is difficult to treat the patient, and for many, it is not cured. This nerve moves with the sensation; and if it is hidden in some men and is subtle and not shown, you should cover the flesh that you cut with the surgeon with the one that you cut with the surgery, and avoid the nerves with your strength.
If the vein is between two nerves, you should cut the vein along its length.
The advantage of cutting the vein in the head is that it relieves the pain of the head and cures the diseases of the feet.
And in this very way, if you want the vein to be cut or not cut by the fleubotomy knife; four is the point saved of all the veins, which is not from the artery nor the nerve.
However, I advise you to be cautious in some men, when they are not fleubotomized in the first percussion, and do not notice in re that apostema.
The first source sentence translates to: "The first thing you should know is that gallbladder surgery is not performed unless the patient's health is in preservation and there is hope for recovery, and if gallbladder surgery is necessary, it is in one of the veins in the thigh, which are: cephalic, black, and basilic; and if gallbladder surgery is necessary at the beginning, it should be done above the knee and below the knee, and in winter, when there are signs of repletion.
And if gallbladder surgery is performed and the third day or at the first push that passes three hours,
This is a medical treatise that discusses various medical procedures and their applications. Here's a line-by-line translation of the given text:
When the child is not circumcised and is four years old, and the girl is not circumcised until the fourth month after seven years, and the elders are not circumcised until they have passed the age of sixty-six years.
And when it is necessary for anyone to be circumcised, it is recommended that the intestines be closed before circumcision, so that the veins do not seep blood into the circumcision of the bowels, which are pure and do not harm the main members.
And the women who are not circumcised do not have natural moisture and excretion, nor evacuation of waste or dysentery when it is possible to do so, nor malnutrition or ebrietas within which they are likely to be within that, nor hydrotic disease, and more than circumcision causes colic, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and multiplicity of coitus and labor and exercise of watching or vigilance and for all causes that dissolve the virtue, or is corporal28 or animal.
And if you consider it in a subtle way of the humors that cause this, if the joint is large, it is good to make incisions and apply remedies, and if it is possible, apply medications to this.
And if you enter in the bath if none of them forbids it, or is exercised by some exercise to make this joint more flexible.
And pause the incision of the foot in the chest, it is time for the third hour, as they have said.
And tell me what this chest should be kept in that day of all animal accidents, as they have said, with how much anxiety, anger, fear, and of all corporal accidents, as they work and excess labor and waste and seeming to them.
And at its seizure, it should be present the causes in the use of that which is customary for men to have aromaticity and odor and am bals and semblances after the quantity of possibility.
And follow the surgeon on a cushion that is placed or that this cushion of that which should be incised.
And if you take out the other arm, and cut it at the same place as the first one, and then tighten the ligature around the wound; and then apply pressure to the wound with the bandage that has been cut.
If the stricture is temporary, then the stricture that does not close or the stricture that is superfluous, you must forbid the flow of salt; or it is a mollification, and you must forbid the body from becoming excessive.
And if the stricture is made, make sure that he who gives the incision cuts his own hands between them, so that the veins are inflamed and are declared in the feeling.
And if the cautery is made on the other arm, use an ancient ointment properly; and stop the other hand over the vein, where the incision will be made, so that the vein may escape a little, and the percussion is set aside as much as possible of the veins which are that which atrophies as if the flebotomy were removed, and of those which are full of wind and when you place the cautery over the vein, you must release the cautery; and the cautery does not strangle the vein, and if it strangles, that one is stretched.
And so, that this lancet may be stopped and be found in all these causes.
When you have stopped the hemorrhage, if the vein is not firm in one place, then do so; otherwise, you will have to repeat this another way further on, or over the spot where it was bleeding, if that part is not swollen.
And if the part is swollen, or the thigh is shrunken, then you should massage it for a day or two, and do not tighten the ligament, for fear of causing an abrupt hernia, nor should you immerse in water.
And if necessary, repeat the incision if needed.
And if the hemorrhage is small and runs subtly, and you fear that it will not stop the desired amount, then repeat the incision in that direction second time rectitudinally and adjust in the hemorrhage a little, and do so with caution until that part is swollen, for if the part is swollen in many places, you must make fewer incisions.
If that part has already swollen, do not repeat the incision over it, for there is no cause for you to avoid it; and stop over that certain part of the file, where the corset of the hemorrhage is, and hold the cors with your hand. This is the best location for oil and the others are not as good.
When it seems that the fever is well-managed in total anesthesia, which anesthetizes the veins of the coronary arteries and causes twitching of the limbs, and when one of those limbs is placed over the area, the heart subsides and revolves when it becomes large.
If, in the location of the anesthesia, a large apoplexy is produced, which makes mottled eyes appear, and especially for that which has not been bled but only that vein, or in the spasm of the small vein, and you cut it and place your hand over the area, soaking it in water and salt, a few scrubs, and then tighten it for an hour, it will dissolve.
And so that the fever is well-managed, apply this remedy to the heart of that vein or another vein.
If, in the location for several days, there is no fever; and if you wish, place your hand over that cause of sweating and dissolving, or a cause of milk from the breast or wool or semblance of the like.
The first line of the text is not in the same style as the previous examples and seems to be a more formal or legal language. It could be translated as: "When the visible signs of the case are such that it requires an operation on the basilica." However, without more context, it's difficult to provide a
This line can be translated as: "Then stop on that point, and if you find any inflammation, place your compression on that point, for that eminence is malicious and evil; and then keep doing this until the cause of what they have said has been found, for blood may flow from the artery.
When the wound is dressed with an astringent, so that the place becomes tolerable, and proper care is given to it by the other physician when it is cured.
It depends on the amount of one's vitality and on the color that appears in the wound, depending on the appearance of the physician.
If the wound is black, you apply the poultice and enter when it becomes red; and if it seems to be large, you apply the poultice and enter when it becomes subtle; and if it is thin, then enter when the sharpness of the wound is exposed.
And it depends on the one who is large and strong and needs extraction of the wound in a vein, where the flebitomy of the vein is amplified and the flebitomies are flat.
And in the case of the fleshy one, make the opposite of that, and it depends on whether it is extracted in troops of veins and whether the wound is straight.
The best that is administered in flebitomy of vein is the transverse section, not puncture.
This flesh-cutting operation is saved from the flow of sin and the injury of nerves, and it is praised and considered safe for future flesh-cutting operations in different latitudes and longitudes.
When gout occurs, it is customary to perform an incision, and you should use a small piece of linen or simple chlorine solution for the incision; extract three or four drops.
If there is inflammation of the incision, you should apply a compress made of warm water or an aromatic oil such as cinnamon, ginger, and similar ones like vanilla, or an aromatic oil with a pleasant scent.
If the incision is lost due to inflammation, and it causes the wound to become more serious, you should ensure that you take an enema of animal broth and an aromatic oil with a subtle scent; use aromatics if possible, and apply the liniment to the affected area.
And use the other causes that have been mentioned in the division of the capsule of the incision for evacuation.
And when the arm becomes swollen and dissolves the wound secondarily, apply the liniment of the quality that was used for the incision evacuation, and the virtue of it is released, which evacuates the sanc little by little, so it is followed by the amount of the virtue in the continuous days.
When the arm becomes painful and the second hand is applied, and the chest becomes strong, it is necessary to make points on the surface of the chest, and the chest pain occurs within a few hours or nine days after the first surgery.
When one wishes to strike the heart of the patient, it is better to do so on the opposite side of the part that declines, as it may happen on the second day or the third.
If the heart of the patient is already inflamed and sharp, and a fever is caused by it, then it is best to cut the sanc in one vein and make the cut as long as possible, and amplify the purulence that comes out when it is cut; and you will preserve all the conditions of flebotomy; and place your hand over the cor's heart, so that it does not die in place of sinus, four veins are best when the flebotomizer is ignorant and negligent.
And if you do not know when to slide the arm and remove the sanc through the second vein, as the wound of the vena is closed and it is difficult to get the sanc out, then you must press with your hand on that side with great force and bend your extension legs, and this is too much.
If the patient has the flebotomy second; or if you remain with the acuitat of the flebotomy that is coagulated by the sanc in the wound of the vena; or pauses over that tyriaca alfarach, or sagzenea, and compremes aquel am compressio leugiera entro que·l sanc sia fora yssit.
If the vein is inflamed, you should avoid touching that area and let it be.
If it requires you to evacuate the sand, and it is not excused, then you should mark that location or on the other arm in another vein.
If the vein called "thigh nerve" is incised in the location of the thigh or cheek, when it is not inflamed or swollen, then it is composed of those.
The quality of the thighotomy is that the patient introduces their hand into the wound, and the focus turns around and the vein becomes clearly visible.
And place your strength on that side of the wound and the narrow suture; and the thighotomy is made according to the transverse short, not longitudinally or according to the length.
And if the abscess is wide and your thighotomy is at that place, then you should make your thighotomy over the joint of the foot a little.
And if the flow of the sand is prohibited, then you should place your hand in the wound and let the sand run into the wound as soon as you can to meet your need.
If you were in the summer days, you would excuse yourself from the iteration of the water in the tail, and the mess would pause the heart's course in water in times of winter.
The surgery of this vein is saved because of all the other veins, as here it has not been found to have pulsating nor nerves.
When the foot surgery of the big toe is referred to as the maladies of the fetter, it means that...
The quality of the foot surgery is that you strengthen the toe or the other foot, because you have placed it in a suture, but if the vein is inflamed and it is demonstrated at the same time; and the fleubotomy is transverse; and if it is not inserted in total, then...
And remember that you do not cut the vein of your foot, because if you do, then you will cut the nerves of the naked bones.
And then insert the toe in the suture and let it run the sanctification through that, because if you do not insert it in the suture, the sanctification will coagulate in the wound of the vein, and it is prohibited to flow.
And when you extract the sanctification according to the amount of necessity, then you should place your hand over the vein or sal, so that it is not consolidated firmly; and it seems that you are doing everything straight.
When the advantage of the laparotomy of that of the left side is recognized, it is because it is attributed to the maladies of the table.
And it seems that in the laparotomy of that side as you have done in the other.
The advantage of the vein sephiya in laparotomy is to the maladies that are in the part opposite to you, as those maladies of the first part, and to retention of menstruations, and to the maladies of the thighs and ulcers of the changes, and to their semblance of the maladies.
The quality of the laparotomy of that side is that it enters the place where there is an agua cauda and fassa over that fricacio entrance where the veins appear; and it over the joint of the foot correia; and the location of the vein the talo appears must be the said pous, and from that which ramificatz in the face of the foot motz ramps.
And therefore the laparotomy of that pu is ample ram or desso the camba must be the talo must be the addition of the, which is better and pu sal.
If you touch that part of the foot, you should protect yourself from the nerves that are near that area, and stop your touching at the point where you touch it through the skin, as if you wanted to insert something there.
And keep your fleubotomies small.
If the wound is forbidden to be stitched, then you should dip the foot in cold water and run the suture through the wound as it is emptied.
If the fleubotomizer goes off course in the first attempt, you should repeat the fleubotomy at a few points, until the area is clean; and do not fear the malician, but protect yourself from the nerves as they have been said.
And seemingly make a suture of the other foot's engagement.
And for the sciatic vein, the location is as they have said, you must cut off the tail of the patient's leg at the wild part of the cavity.
And the success of the fleubotomy of the patient is in doubt when it comes to stitching the wound.
The quality of the incision made by you is that it enters the flesh in a bag, and quickly and firmly constricts the thigh muscle of the wide part between the two toes, which does not appear except for this reason.
When it appears, you make the incision at that second course of the thigh bone that is possible for you and the second transverse, and it is better; or if you inscribe it with an inscription or cut it with a cut, the place of the wound will be salved.
And that is in the hands of men who are ashamed; and if you cut it too much, and it does not appear to the whole, then make an incision in some part of the thigh, and that which appears in the two toes of the foot is that which is said in the ear and the ring.
And keep an eye on the nerves, and make it run the amount you want.
Then relieve the stricture and place your hand over the location of the incision, which firmly constricts it, and the wound becomes healthy.
Of the ventilation and of the quality of using those.
Ventozas so de corns, o de eram, o de veyre. - This phrase translates to "Wind is caused by the lungs, or by the eyes, or by the
E ventozacio es fayta segon doas manieyras: la una de lor es am scarificacio e extracio de sanc, e l’autra es ventozacio ses scarificacio. - This phrase translates to "And wind is caused by two methods of scarification and extraction of pus: one of them is a scarification and extraction of pus, and the other is causing wind.
E aquesta ventozacio que es ses scarificacio es segon doas manieyras, quar o es am foc o ses foc. - This phrase translates to "And this wind caused by scarification is done by two methods: either by fire or by water.
E a las ventozas que so administradas am scarificacio e extraccio de sanc son xiiii locs del cors, dels quals la un en lo qual so pausadas ventozas es alnocrati, e es la deriera partida del cap; e le mieg loc d’el de doas partz del col ensemp; e ventozas del mento dejos la mandibula pus dejas de la boca; e ventozas de doas spatulas; e ventozas de alohoster, e es sobre la fi de la coeta; e ventozas de dos focils, e so de dos brasses; e ventozas de doas cavilhas; e ventozas de doas cuoyssas. - This phrase translates to "And the wind caused by scarification and extraction of pus is in fourteen locations of the body, where the first location of the wind is the neck, and the second location is the chin; and the third location is the mandible; and the fourth location is the spatula; and the fifth location is the toothbrush; and the sixth location is the end of the hair; and the seventh location is the two burns; and the eighth location is the two braces; and the ninth location is the cavities; and the tenth location is the pits.
The first source sentence translates to:
If necessary, it may cause vomiting due to bad health or continuous use, take the remedy in its entirety at the beginning of the month and at the end, and in the same location of the month and whenever it is needed.
And when it happens in any of those causes, and especially if it is in the third or fourth week of the month, you should command that vomiting be caused to occur as quickly as possible, which has passed for two or three hours.
When the patient's neck is painful and the pain radiates to the head and extends to the limbs, it is believed that there is an evacuation of all the body's parts.
This wind is in the location of head surgery of the cephalic.
When it is not necessary to use that which is of the complexion of the patient or in that which is catarrh, give rather to that great harm.
And therefore it does not matter if one uses the eyes, and in the heads of those who have poorly shaped eyebrows.
It is better for that which is continuously over it to be forgotten; and therefore, it is necessary that the wind operator pause his work a little while at the parts where he was, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Less ventilation of alchemy is in place of flebotomy of the dark vein and the basilica: and therefore, it confirms the lung, and the contraction of air and the scissure of the sternum of air, and the throat, and the repletion.
And it is necessary that the alchemy wind be a little closed, for if it is paused later, it will generate weakness in the heart and stomach.
And the wind of alchemy confirms the accidental pains in the head and obtalmia, and emigrance, and prefocation, and pain in the gums of the teeth; and it is in place of flebotomy of the basilica.
When you command the windbag to not press on his chest so that the artery does not get infected and blood clots do not occur.
A windbag is placed over the neck to relieve alcohol from the mouth, and to prevent corruption of the gums, and to resemble those that are in the mouth of the sick, and are located in the place of fleebotomy of the upper lip.
May the windbag that is made over the teeth relieve the capillaries, which are made for replenishment of heat.
And the windbag that is divided from the teeth relieves the capillaries of the fire, which are divided into three veins, which are of the basilica, dark and cephalic, for which that the sand of those veins is pushed by hands that are in the flesh, and the others that are thin are pushed inside when the attraction comes to the three veins.
And command the windbag not to scarify too much, which the place is stripped of flesh, and leave it nerves and arteries.
This line seems to be describing a wind or breeze that affects the areas around the thighs and buttocks, causing inflammation of the muscles and ulcers on the heels. Here's a possible translation:
If you command the wind to bring a great breeze, and that it be of earth, then the place will indicate a need for thorough cutting; and much like subtle winds are sharpened in sharpening, so too should the wound be sharpened in sharpening.
Many winds are manifested by the movement of the limbs, which relieve the pain of old gallstones and the prostate, and also provoke menstruation, and alleviate bothersome and difficulties; and they stand in the location for fleubotomy of difficult cases, and alahorcoben, and of cavilhas.
Then, to make the body cold and add sinews to the homes.
And of the winds, alahorcoben is proper to the winds of the thighs.
The quality of the position of the winds is that they pause the wind at the beginning of the view and sustain it with well-tempered breath, and do not prolong the position of the winds, less pause those movements, and return them to their place, and that the humors come to the location by chance. When you do not cease to touch and continue entering until you see the wound already swollen and inflamed, and the pain of the sanctuary appears.
And you scrape and continue to make small incisions, and consider in the position of the chest.
Fourth, if that man has flesh of rare kinds, cover that you scrape one layer and not push, so that the place is not ulcerated.
And command the wind to amplify the incision and pour a little, and facilitate the wound at ease.
And if in the sanctuary it grows, you cover that you scrape several incisions, where in the first incision the way of subtlety to the sanctuary and the acuity of the knife are. Less in the second by the inspection of the acquired water of the extraction of the large sanctuary.
And if the sanctuary is very fecal, you are necessary to make a deep incision in the last incision so that you can reach the derivation.
Finally, when we want to extract the sanctuary little by little or a small piece, it is enough for us one incision.
If you want to remove a thorn, make a cut with a sharp cut; and if we found that the thorn is large, then cover the cut with a cut made by a deeper cut.
The term of the cut in which the depth of the wound is considered alone.
If that of which the wound is thick, hard, dark, and the skin is stretched, cover it with a cut in which the holes of the veins are more lenient and more resoluble; if it is in summer, use olive oil or oil of viola, or oil of amber, or oil of chamomile; and if it is in winter, use olive oil, oil of liquorice, oil of camomile, or oil of sage, and as for those similarities.
If the excess is large, cut it off, and use the oil as dark as possible, or oil of balsam, or oil of aloe, or oil of anet, and as for those similarities.
If the wind is of large skin thickness, cover it with oil that is not allowed for the wound, and cover it with this, the holes of the wind for the winding are more lenient and more resoluble; if they are in summer, use olive oil, olive oil, olive oil, or olive oil, or olive oil, and as for those similarities.
When that of which the sanctification is gouty humor, wash your nostrils with vinegar or with water and alcohol, or with any other suitable substance.
When that of which the superfluities are gross, wash your nostrils with vinegar or with any other suitable substance, such as sansucc, which is majorana, or decoccio of anet, or camamilla, and it seems to have an effect.
And cover the nostrils with a cloth; there are some who advise that it should be kept in place for an hour or for several hours, and some who recommend that you should sleep with the cloth on your nose.
What is to be done so that the nostrils are to be cleaned before washing?
Consider the following: if the vapor or that which gives off sanguination is harsh and burns the nose and causes inflammation, then you should take cold causes, such as milk vinegar, and mix them with water and alcohol, and add a pinch of sugar, and julep, and it seems to have an effect.
When the patient's movements are paused and their legs are placed in a certain position, and their arms are extended, it seems to relieve them of their pain.
And of that which relieves the compound pain, it is believed that it is taken in the form of a powder or ointment made from alum, or alumnium salt, and sumac, and some scented plants; and that it is recommended that it be used sparingly with food and drink, and that the movements of the patient's legs and cannabis, pissers, small fruits, and columbine are paused.
And it is believed that in the day of ventilation and flebotomy, the dose of medicine is greater than the food.
And it is believed that it is given in the form of a powder in some hours to Tyrian men, or muscle medicines, such as musk, or alum, or during ventilation or flebotomy, or afterward, so that those principal members are comfortable and that the wound is subsided; and it does not believe that the patient takes that scald.
When the wounds that have been made are windings that have been paused on the flesh, and over the metatarsal bones, and the umbilicus, in the loci of the joints, and the groin, these members do not suffer scarification on themselves.
It is not sought for those but as an attractant of the member, like when they pause windings over the mammary glands in the thighs of flux of sanc of the sanc of the nars; and they use that which is dissolved ventositat freja inviscade of the member, like when they pause over the abdomen and the umbilicus; then that rarefied member and scalfs it and removes the pain that resolves ventositat.
And if it has been paused over the rings when they fall into their impotence or dryness, then by virtue of the attraction of the member for the pleasure of the female impotence and the eradication of the dryness from its place.
And it seems that when it has been paused over the foot and the metatarsal bone there is ventositat in those enclosed ones.
This wind is managed with great care, and some winds are managed by fire.
And some winds are managed with water, which is used in the treatment of skin diseases.
And it is because the wind is filled and is large that water is added alone or water in which there are certain herbs to make it suitable for the wind.
Form of wind administered by fire: the width of the orifice is two inches; the quantity of preon is the largest part of a palm; and it is in the center of the wind, in the location where it is in the circuit, the thickness is small according to the amount that enters it with a needle.
It is said that if there are large margins, lemon, lion's teeth, and thick threads are used to hold the member in its position over the wind.
And if at the end of the verge there is iron or steel, where a candle is placed over the fire.
And this wind is greater than the one recommended; and the less amount of that according to the skin diseases and the state of that person who uses it.
When the winds of the fetuses are affected by other things than those of the young and large bellies, it is necessary to pay attention to this matter.
The quality of stopping this wind is to place the focus on the member that extends the focus of dry wood gently with a little wax candle, and place it over the midriff of the belly transverse in the midriff location of the wind, so that the focus is lit around the part where it comes out so that the belly of the patient does not burn.
And if it is placed over the belly of the patient, and it is said to be on the track that has been said, then when you have the winds and do not indicate that they are on that track and that the vapor is on that track, the wind will dissolve so much.
And properly light the focus according to your hand, and repeat this if you are indicated to do so.
The fewer winds that are administered to the belly of the patient, who is young and plump, without a midriff and track, and only filled with water, and it is placed over the member just like this.
This is the way it should be done: This ventilation, the more powerful it is, the better, because it can receive a large amount of water.

2. "Sanguissuguas no so administradas en motz membres sino en les membres en les quals non es possible posicio de ventosas, per la parvitat de aquels, ayssi cum le pot e gingiva e semblantz a lor; o en membre denudat de carn, ayssi cum le dit e·l nas e lors semblantz." translates to "Joint pain is not managed in any other joints except those in which it is impossible to position winds, due to their smallness, as the gums and appearance of the teeth, or in a bare bone member, as the nose and its appearance; or in a bare skin member, as the tongue and its appearance.
When it comes to the quality of using those that you have found to have bloody discharges in their dirty water-filled wounds.
And if their skin is dry and they are in water-filled wounds that are not causing any discomfort, and there is no cause found in the stomach of those; and their intestine is emptied at the beginning of the surgery and the ventricles; and their thighs are frogged after they have swelled; and they are placed over it.
And when they are full, that is the case.
And if it is possible to suck out the wound with wind, it is less painful in the end.
Otherwise, wash the wound with clean water and warm water; and it should be shaved and expressed.
If the intestine of the patient is prolonged and there are bloody discharges, and they continue to be exuded, then you should put a damp cloth in the water-filled wound, and place it over the area until the exudate is absorbed.
If the sand is multiplied, you should powder it over the vitriol taken, or like them to the causes of scrofula; and they are paused over the place the exfoliated hairs are laid, and they are left inside when the hairs adhere to the place, and the sand is abscised.
When necessary, perform a bloodletting procedure by changing those that can be altered.
If bloodletting is prohibited by suspension, then make points on the spot with a sharp point or insert a needle into the places that are most sensitive to pain; and make sure those points are placed, so that when there is any pain, it does not cause discomfort.
When you want to clean them, sprinkle a little of salt, or sand, or ashes, and rub it well.
Now begins the second part: from restoration. This chapter is written with the necessary knowledge of the art of medicine; and it is a restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
Oh, child, understand that this chapter is full of the follies and vain opinions of the ancients and those who, over time, did not pay attention to the free books of the Ancients nor read any of their letters.
And for this reason, this collection of scientists' works in our land is private; and you are not obliged to pay for it at that time, nor have I received any orders for it, except through the long study of the free books of the Ancients and the understanding of those, and then to extract the science from them.
And accordingly direct your attention to experiments and studies along the length of the body's life.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
The first line of the text is "Capitol primier,
The first line of the text is "Summae et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fraftorum et diversorum si uniuscuiusque. This sentence appears to be discussing the interpretation of a capital (or inscription) from a historical text. The authors, skilled in understanding the truth of these matters, have placed themselves above others in knowledge. They invite the reader to join them in this noble art, as they are prompt and wise in their understanding of it.
When a fracture or dislocation or twist or sprain occurs, you should immediately seek medical attention or have someone call for help, or if no one is available, then do as best as you can, considering the severity of the injury, whether it is due to old age, weakness, or intense heat and cold.
And let your diet consist of fresh herbs and lean meats and legumes; and prohibit fatty meats and excessive amounts of vegetables and all food that fills the veins of the sac, entering if you are sure of not having an apoplexy, and if you do not fear excessive fluid in the member.
And return the patient to their original routine as it is customary for them.
When the wound begins to heal, you should ensure that the diet is not nutritive and lacking in food that is lean and heavy, considering how those foods are made from flour, milk, eggs, cheese, and meat of cows, and fruits, and fresh vegetables, and peeled potatoes, and grapes, and similar foods, and this diet should be followed with coagulation of the fracture with honey and mallows.
You know that bones crack when they are in men and in the first childbirth and in the elderly, it is not possible for them to be continued and to be consolidated afterwards due to the dryness of their limbs.
However, nature adjusts and narrows over the cut bones of all parts due to some cause similar to glue that adheres and strengthens that part which is consolidated and glued, at the end of fatigue and firmness, just as fire at the beginning, at the end of any cause that does not prohibit that from one of its works.
And for this reason it is necessary to place the pincers on the thighs, where gravity and viscosity and heaviness are, as has been said.
You are aware that the species of fracture vary according to the diversity of the limbs, as a fracture of the bone in the thigh is different from a fracture of the skull; and a fracture of the pelvic bone is different from a fracture of the two feet; and it seems that all other members are also different from these.
And you remember the entire species of fracture, explained in the distinct head of the other.
Different types of fractures have their own characteristics. Different species of bone fractures have their own characteristics. Some are curved, while others occur in the longitudinal direction of the bone; and some are caused by the length of the bone: and so are the fractures of the thighs and hips and other parts, which can be caused or not caused, as it is written in the pen when it is prepared to write, and is a fracture of the crack and disruption in the skull, and a fissure.
And each species is unique in its restoration according to what was remembered from the distinct head in their respective locations.
When there is a motion of fracture of the bone. And thus, fracture of the bone is known: it is a twisting of the bone, and of that prominence, and one can see it in the sensation, and it is when you feel that with your hand.
And when there is not an apparent twisting and no pain is felt when touching the bone with the hand, and the thigh does not swell greatly, then there is no fracture.
There may be a twisting or a small fissure, but do not assume that you feel it with your hand and compression of the whole; there may be a pause over it of some medicines of which you remember a little at that moment that is suitable for the place; and there may be a stricture subtle.
You know that this place when it is arched and does not divide into two or another, and there are no accidents in its sagittary, and you feel that the whole part of the hand is remaugued, then you know that at your time you have to correct the position of those that happen in the apophyse of the cautery.
If the accident is an aposteme, then you should treat it with that for several days until the aposteme ceases; and afterwards, cut off the second finger of that hand which you can lift and hold.
You know that the restoration and healing of the wound is slower than the healing of the bone in the case where this accident occurred.
And then strengthen that second finger which will come with the memory of the wound.
If in the bone there are saturnine humors, then you need to extend this member cut off from two parts, if it is the hand or the foot; or if it is small, then stretch it with your hand; or with several cords or one cord and the hand.
And your position should be at the place where you hold the member with your hand, while the parts are extended of the cut off member, then you must perform those actions that return those addictions to the hand and to each finger that can be placed in its place.
And watch that your force does not fall on the thigh because of your operation of bones or injuries; and perform those actions that you can apply to one bone with another in better forms.
When it is advantageous at that time to touch with your hand to that part of you, and if you see here sometimes a different cause, adjust that and correct it according to the amount of your virtue.
When there is excessive extension and compression, as when doctors perform operations on visible tendons that have been previously seen during the operation of their own hands, or when they cause contraction in the member they are operating on, as has been observed by them in their own operations.
And the quality of the stricture of the member is that which you recommend; so you know that some members are differentiated in their appearance and size and shape.
When those who are small as the arm and elbow say and seem to be like those, it is necessary to cover the envelope with a thin silk.
For those who are large as the thigh or calf, it is necessary to cover the envelope with a hard and strong layer, so that the liaison of the member gran connects the whole part in stricture engual, as if there were no macula.
Then, begin to evacuate the equacio, place the convenient liment over it, on the location of that fracture am three or four envolucios or quatre segon that·l member mereys; and strengthen your hand a little with a petit am the liament.
Then, hold am that part at the end of the location of the fracture, and strengthen the hands that do not focus your strictura am that have strengthened the location of the fracture. Then, elongate you am the envelope of the location of the fracture a little, and soften the strictura petit a petit, when you take from the location a great part.
Then take another knife and wrap the other vein around the location you want to enclose, and see if the envelopes are at the part where the fracture ends; and your operation will be in the stricture of the envelope and in the mollification of that second one that they have said in the first envelope.
Then pause between the feathers of the lion's stop or the drap if the tortuosity of the fracture is engulfed in it, if it has a tortuosity; and otherwise, do not pause in it for any cause.
Then pause on the other knife, and engulf over these envelopes steadily as much as possible, if in the location there is no inflammation or post-cautery pain, and you should pause on the one that seduces that pain and that ossifies the inflammation; and then leave it for a few days; and you should strengthen over the stellae.
And are the stellae of the joint of the cane of the race, and they are formed in a straight way; or are of bark of pine; or of ramps of palm; and is the ample of each stella according to this form and this figure:

1. You should know that cutting all the limbs at once is not recommended on the first day; the cause of this is that the limb, when it is large, does not allow you to rest on it for more than a few days or weeks, according to your own experience with the onset of gangrene.
This is the manner in which the emplacements are made by the ancients, which they used over fractures and dislocations, and twists.
When making a new bone cast, it is convenient to use a complete and major one for the thighs and hips, as it does not generate heat or pressure: and that is because you take flour powder and the bone marrow that comes out of the grain, and the movement of the grain in the joints of the grain.
And comfort that aid comes when it is needed, but be careful not to cry out loudly and pause the comfort of the thin or subtle one; and use that instead.
Another method of setting a fracture or dislocation and sprain: recipe of assafetida, of laudanum, of acacia, of unguent, and migrach, which is made from salt of milk of gold, of all parts of the dragon; of mirra and aloe of the dragon's blood; alcohol of the dragon's blood; twenty times; all the three parts and cryings and mixtures with water of alcohol or of album of huou if the thigh is scalped; and use this setting, as it has a good composition and restores the broken bones gently, and confirms the home.
Here is the translation of the first source sentence:
1. All of them are in a mortar with moving parts, and they are cribbed, and they are fine for water or alcohol of honey and it is administered.
When applying a poultice to joints and bones that have been separated from their original locations, and there is pain in those areas as well as fissures and fractures: hold the lint in place with string and submerge it in warm water and oil, and place it over the area.
However, this ointment is not suitable for restoration or extraction, but rather to relieve pain.
Another poultice that restores the cut: use fresh thyme leaves and saffron threads; mix them all together and make a poultice.
A poultice openly administered for the restoration of bone fracture and when you want to resolve the swelling of inflammation: mix together chamomile flowers, catnip, and violet flowers, flour of ers, all the parts cut into small pieces, and then tie them up; they are all perfumed and the member does not swell.
However, if it swells, comfort the member with that cool water of aloe or with cold water and use it on the affected area.
Otherwise, when the gout occurs, you must restore the member: a recipe of aloe and the seeds of liver, and of balm, majoram, violet flowers, of chamomile, of all herbs and parts, and all are cut and dried in the water of sauze or of dove or of vi, according to the quality of the member and the color of the part.
I do not say that you should place wax on the member that needs to be restored, unless you have made a recipe of wax and oil, and nothing else; and I recommend that it is better between thickness and fineness.
I have seen that Gualia is placed on the member that needs to be restored, and if there are causes that cause dryness in the parts, it is better to use those causes that have been recommended, as they are similar to those that cause dryness in the parts.
Plaster that soothes the wound and pain: a recipe made with wax, hairs of mouse or pennyroyal, and aloe, and salt, divided into parts; they are cut and combed and their roots are dried, and it is made into plaster.
When the second quantity is followed by the one that covers the limb and is dislocated, it is considered if there is no pain or twist or the bone is broken, then it is not suitable for this place, you should not cut any bones. And if you encounter pain, twist, or inflammation at the location, you should tie it or cut that part at that time, and remove the plaster from it.
And take some cloth and wet seaweed, and submerge that in cold water, and let it wash the place within which the twist and pain cease; and after that, dress the member for an hour; and then cover the submerged seaweed with vinegar and oil or rose oil, and put it on the member again, ensuring there is no cautery, and the inflammation of the member is relieved, and the pain is reduced.
And repeat that tightening subtly and applying a small amount of plaster, and gently press it to your first constraint, and subtly when it is healed.
When the wound is painful, swollen, inflamed, and other symptoms are similar to those of all diseases, and they order for plastering and bandaging, you should apply it in the same way as you did at the beginning of the incision.
If no harm is caused to the member by any of those causes that have been said, you should not remove it for less than three days or four or seven; and some patients heal completely in twenty days after your removal, according to what has been told you, as soon as the fracture adheres, and when it is placed over the coagulation of the flesh on that part.
And you should adjust the bandage more tightly than in your own, and reduce the swelling of the patient's thigh, according to what follows the remorse of the wound.
If you sometimes find that the location of the fracture is dry and shriveled, and less than what is necessary, you should know that this nutrient is forbidden to reach there; and therefore, moisten it with water from the entire wound that you have made; and after three days, loosen the bandage a little, and for this operation, allow the member to receive nourishment, and it will heal.
When the surgeons attempt to restore the fracture of another unseen bone that is not restored at the beginning, following which they cover it and then restore it according to its curvature, they make an error in their operation and are greatly afraid, and if this is indeed the case, the antics become free and are agitated by what they see or hear.
I have not seen any of them do this before, so it is reasonable that this does not work.
Capitol second: Of fracture when it occurs in the head.
The types of fractures are blows, and their figures are diverse, and their causes are distinct. Four types of fractures are caused by the impact of bones, and the impact penetrates into the entire bone, which is then removed from the body, as in the case of a broken arm, and this type of fracture is called subtraction; or the bone enters a part of the bone, and enters the flesh and does not pass through the entrance of the end; and this type of fracture is called complete separation.
When the plague of these broken bones is great or small, and whether they are comminuted or avulsion fractures; and the cause of their pain is burning or cramping over the foot, and their appearance.
This fracture or penetrates that was previously approached by the panellum which I leave the bones; or it is in the face of the bone, and the plague of these fractures is great or small.
When a fracture occurs in the bone, in the subtlety of the small hair petite, and for that reason this special capillary fracture is called.
It is a fracture that is made or by pressure or percussion of the stone and to its appearance, which enters any layer of the bone in the parts of fingers, and it is made in the concave location where the stones are when they are percussed and their part is separated into the parts of fingers.
And this is made truly in the bones of the human humors, as it is the caps of the eyebrows.
And all these special fractures are made in such ways that they are separated as stars. And I will find you in the reremoration of all this in its place.
And I would know all these special kinds of fractures by detection over them and by the search for their tendons and other flesh that is corrupted over them.
And the special capillary is known by what is discovered over the bone, and it is removed, and it is covered over the tendon, where the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of fracture, at the beginning, consider the accidents of the thigh, and then if you see percussions on the thighs, which are understood as meaning for the understanding of the patient, such as vomiting of choler, and so on, and loss of understanding, and abscess of vote, and scarlet fever, and sincopsis, and acute fever, and edema of the limbs, and resemblance to these accidents in greater positions, then his doctor is not cured.
If you sometimes see non-corresponding accidents, you hope for health, then begin the treatment of the patient.
The cause is clear if you come to me with the disease as it is and as it is in the days of winter, then I advise you to study in the bone of the patient on the 14th day of the full position.
And if it is in the days of summer, I advise you to watch over the bone on the 7th day, having understood that then the bone will be corrupted by the panniculus, and that accidents will occur that have been reported.
If the fracture has already progressed to the skull, covering it with a bandage, and the fragments are small and fragmented, you should cover the area that is comminuted and abraded, according to what I recommend to you.
If you find the head of the thigh infected, and you discover the bones according to custom and with your hands, and it is better for the treatment of the wound, and that it is not affected by the wound.
If you happen to find the bone, apply antiseptic or cautery, and then cover it with what is appropriate for the wound, and if it is saturated with blood that is infused in vinegar and olive oil, and stop the wound as soon as it is sedated by the cautery, and make sure there are no signs of infection; and then start from the circumference of the bone and from its removal.
And that is followed by one of two methods of operation.
And the first method is that you insert the bones into the bone holes that are straight and this is the form of it: And then administer another insertion, a smaller purse than that; and this is the form of it:
And then apply the appropriate amount of the anesthetic that was prepared for the second one.
And you should know the names of several types of scalpels, of which some push more than others; and some push less but are sharper than the others and are made of iron or steel.
And use them with ease by pressing on the scalpel with it, which does not cause pain to the head or lead to bleeding.
If the bones are hard and strong, then know that you should perforate in the course of the bone through which you administer the scalpels, which are called non-penetrating trays.
And not all are called as such but only those that do not pause at the end of the bone's term as far as it is appropriate for the tray, which is rounded or has a margin on the side that is left with the cap of the hard one, similar to a small circle, which prohibits being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take of these trays a large number of those that are appropriate for the sharpness of each bone, taking into account that it is in your present in all parts of the brain, the extent of which is the sharp point, the quantity in length and breadth is second to the quantity of sharpness of this test.
This is the form of three kinds of teravels: The quality of piercing into the circuit of the cut bone is that you place the teravel on the bone and roll it around until you know that the bone has been penetrated; and accordingly, you move the teravel to another location and place it there where it comes between all the quantity of the swelling of the ring or goes around it.
And if you want to cut open the joint that is in between any bone of the bone, and make a small hole that you can put something on it to stop the leakage, as they have said, after you have struck the bone, or am your own hand, or am another cause for such sturmentz as will appear at that joint, as scalpels and fine forceps.
And be sure that you do not touch any cause of the cipherac with the cutter.
And if you have perforated the bone and separated it from the cipherac if you continue to use it, and if you extract it, be sure that the edges are rounded and the corners are smooth like the cutting edge of the knife, but do not forget that the hole should be small and subtle like the other cuts.
And if you find any small part of the bones, take advantage of that to help with the sturmentz; and then care for the plague on the lichinis and find those which have said.
And the other hand of operation is less, longer than the arm, which was discovered by Gualia and the one who praised it greatly; and this is the saying of the one who says to you at the beginning that you must discover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is vehement and manifest, when you have discovered that part and have stopped there with this lent and happy inscissor of which this is the form:
When the lenticular part is a lion and does not include any cause, and the acute part is in two layers in length, as many times; that the lenticular part should be adjusted to the cipher of the face of the acute part that incidents on the bone.
And if you cut about the incisors of a tooth, that all the bones are facilitated as much as possible, and you are sure that no particol does not happen in the accident that you fear in any hand, and if the physician were the best of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he were sleeping.
If Romania has any cause attached to the bone of the pannicol in certain places of bones, it will be cut at that place of the incisors that is lenticular, and it will be easy to deliver, which is delivered from the suffering and pain.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the pannicol, and that is abscised or left in the bone is the face of it, and the physician is rough and sharp on the face, then you should know that this roughness and sharpness are due to those subtle rasors by which you have prepared the number of different quantities so that you can administer them in total according to the convenient ones of those and the right ones of those following as soon as you lose your operation that cut bone and the figure of it.
When you administer the medicine in your hand that contains the qualities of those razoris, and use a small amount of it on the pus subtle of the wound, and do not stop until you have completely administered the entire pus and the pus subtle of all of them.
In any of the other small fractures and subtle fractures, when you have used up the medicine for the correction of that, continue with the next one.
And it is because it is not applied to all those who have studied in that art. And write about what has been shown in great fractures.
And if the bandage is torn when you radiate the bone, then use as much of the second piece of cloth as the quantity of pus requires, and submerge it in olive oil, and place it over the orifice of the pus; and take another double or triple piece of cloth and submerge it in olive oil and place it over the first one and administer the pus gently that you can over that, not pressing too hard on the pus as much as possible; and apply it to the bandage, and do not tighten it only by the amount of pus you have.
When the patient has used this remedy for one or two days and is sure of not having postprandial stomach ache; then remove that and administer medicines according to those which are superfluous for thirst, such as linen and flour of errors, powder of ense and aristology, and deceptive ones like those.
This is the first source sentence to translate:
1. Keep an eye on your own virtue to ensure that the plague in your practice is not fatal; and do not be in haste to engage or another; nor add virulence to it; for when it is adjusted over the pannicol of the brain, corrupt that and dry it up, and act upon the malice of the malicious one.
When something happens to the head, as the skull and the bones are more affected when the care of the patient is neglected, and darkens on the surface; and then consider that you have made a mistake in the intestines that have been said, know that it is very dangerous.
And if it is not dark but due to the medicine that was stopped, and it is in virtue of that medicine that caused that darkening, you should know that you are holding in your hand a part of melted wax and three olive oils, and apply those lines over the head; and then treat it with the specifics of cure that are appropriate for when it is healthy.
Chapter 3.
Of restoring the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken but has cartilage, either two bones, or one of those certain ones, because in it you have two bones, and the part you left is cartilaginous, and it is not broken but has atrophy and tortuosity and synovitis.
If one of the parts of the body is twisted, you should know that you must insert the small instrument into the nose, and close the fracture with the tip of the other instrument, and with the tip of the third instrument, enter it in its original shape. And this is done for your convenience, and be careful not to obstruct the operation on the patient's thigh.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the tip does not reach it, you should know that you must make it equal to the end of the bone in which the small piece is located.
If the fracture is in multiple parts, you should make it look like that.
And for the restoration of the part in the first day of the fracture, if possible; and otherwise, you should take the vii or·l x that you need to repair the cautery.
And enter a mechanism of drap in the end of the nose, if the fracture is in one part, or put several stitches, if the fracture is in multiple parts, and it is in the grossitut of so much quantity that fills the cavity of the nose.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. The flesh is enveloped in a layer of fat, and it is moved throughout the day, but not visible to me; having a covering like the meat is wrapped in a layer of powder like flour; and then the calf is inserted between the bone when it is fixed and the cartilage is endured.
If some worms are found in the nose, instead of joint pain, it is a penny that is wrapped in a layer of leon's fur; and it is because you have already broken the nose with great force and the throat is not prohibited for inspiration.
This cause is not necessary for you; and if you want, do it, and if you want, make joint pain.
If another worm is found in the nose, apply the plaster to the nose with carrot or cheese, or with oil of rosemary or with diatomaceous earth.
If you do not find worms in the nose, then cover that defense with flour and powdered enseal, and place it on the leon's stop, and do not let the nose be caused by any other reason.
If the bones of the nose are slightly fractured or displaced, then cover them with something that divides over those, and remove those using instruments that are appropriate for those; and then close the cut, and care for that with what is suitable for it, which is to encrust and consolidate, and apply plasters that are suitable for it.
If the patient has a cold in the nose, then cover that part with something that is warm and moist, and administer saline solutions through the nostrils.
Chapter 12.
Of the restoration of the jaw when it is broken.
When the jaw is broken and the fracture is not infected, look at whether the fracture is deformed only, and not split in two and curved into parts of the teeth, then your diagnosis is slight.
And cover it then, if the fracture is in the left side, that you insert the left indicateral into the mouth of the patient; and similarly, if the fracture is on the right side, you insert the indicational of the other hand into the patient's mouth; and press gently on that to facilitate the deformity of the broken teeth in the parts of the jaw that are deformed, and in the other part of the jaw that is deformed.
If the fracture of the jaw has already been separated into two parts, you should cover that with a splint made up of two parts, following the correct angle if possible.
If you experience dental concussion, you should tighten those that seem to be loose, such as gold or silver fillings; and place a pressure over the broken jaw, and over the drap duplicate, and over the large stainless steel implant gently, depending on what you have configured for the drill hole of the jaw and that fits the application, if it is not destroyed.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and stop eating the foods that cause gas.
If you suspect that the figure has changed in any way, you should examine it the next day and correct what has changed, making sure that the powder of molybdenum, albumin of honey, or flour of wheat paste, is applied to the root of the tooth, and place a lynx over the leon's fur.
When the plaster is applied and adjusted to the bone, and the position of the bone is not altered, remove this one, which does not allow it to be taken out until it is healed and strengthens the fracture; four weeks later, this fracture is firmly fixed.
If another accident is seen after cauterization, administer the medicines that have been given in the session of the patient after he is healed, and keep that cauterization intact.
If the fracture is wet, consider if it is the bone separated or split, and you should gently touch those splits with what is most suitable for that in the removal of those from the splints.
If the wound of the fracture is firm, you should enlarge it as much as possible according to the amount of your need by fleebomy.
When you have left those splits and they do not reappear, you should enlarge the wound of the fracture if it is wide; otherwise, stop on one of those plasters that are most suitable for this and cover that, until it is healed.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided text is not in
The provided text is not in Latin, Italian, Spanish, or French, and it does not seem to be a medieval medical treatise. The text is in Occitan,
The provided text is in Occitan and it seems to be a medical treatise. Here's the translation:
When the bone is broken, it is either torn, separated, or separated into two parts, another that does not cause any pain; and it is considered for the restoration of the bone; or it is said to have happened in this fracture, and it is difficult to restore the bone; or it is said that the fracture is infected.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is infected, is that you make sure to have two assistants, so that one holds the assistant and follows the broken part, and the other extends the collar to that part.
And make sure to close the fracture as soon as it is found that it is a true form of the bone according to its shape, and not in it an eminence or concavity.
And if you ask for extension, make sure to pause until you have the tail of the thigh placed outside the drap or cloth, and the size of the extensor according to the amount of your need; and extend and lift the collar and cut the suture inside that you enclose the fracture as soon as it is found.
If you cannot stretch the end of the shoulder blade to the deformed parts, as it was when it was new, then you should make sure that the thigh is flexed over its neck, and place your hand on the muscle of the thigh a larger size.
The minister presses the muscle of the thigh in the parts that were previously entered when the shoulder blade bone was raised above its original position, and you should then correct the fracture and align it with those that were mentioned earlier.
If you feel pain in the shoulder blade and muscles, you should cover that area and remove those sags for ease.
If it is held in the bone, you should make an incision in the shoulder blade as one of the incisions you have prepared for this, because you had previously placed the thigh on the sturment that serves the cipher; and the sturment is made of wood or iron, and this is the form of it:
It resembles a cow's stomach where this concavity is; and its longitude is according to what you need of it, according to the size of the bone or the thinness of it.
When the length of the member is second to your ability in the operation; that there be a pair of extremities each time, and one be wide and the other tight.
And if the dislocation of the fracture that you caused when you removed the cartilage of the bone is wide, and it is sure to cause a gap, then you adjust the two sides of the wound of the fracture with sutures.
And if the dislocation is small, or you fear apoplexy, then you fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the amount of the wound's gap.
And if apoplexy occurs, you inform the cloth with vinegar and rosewater, and stop on that.
And so, that the splint may not be damaged by the broken bone; and for this reason, every day that you see the patient, when the limb is softened or the splint has already been damaged, you must correct this and tighten the strap.
Then pause the patient's arm over the shoulder of the other, and pause further the elbow of the one who has to sleep on the shoulder of the other; so that it may be elevated the assistant's hand of that from the shoulder of that, and thus the fracture of the shoulder is raised to the muscle's elevation; or if the arm of the patient is over the collarbone of the other.
When opening a wound, do not close it if it does not heal in the desired location or scar, and re-enter after twelve days.
If you have seen the face of the patient's wound and adjusted it to the stricture, and restored it after it has been repaired and the fracture of the clavicle has coagulated, then proceed.
And it should be strengthened and comforted after twenty-eight days, and some wounds in other people's bodies are made at certain times of the month.
Chapter six.
On the repair of shoulder fractures.
A spatula is cut in the location below the shoulder and not in the margins.
And when the location is cut — and it is cut in the middle of the location — and not recognized unless touched, then follow that the figure of the fractured shoulder is prepared for the preparation of the wound and reduced to its natural position in the entire manifold of engagement that is possible.
And place your hand over the powder of almond oil and lemon juice; and place a pinch of duplicatus powder; and place your hand on the soft stone of the table according to the amount of the spatula or less.
If the surface of the table is concave in some parts of the spatula, then you should insert a straight piece of iron into that concavity, and it may hold the table equally.
And if you stretch it a little with moistened humor, it will not be tightened by the force of the table, and it will enter more easily between the pieces.
And consider the limb in every day; and all watched that it is softened, another watch and stretch the limb and hold the table even if it becomes tightened by the force of the location.
And place the hernia on the side of the seat.
And the table is restored in 20 days or in .25.
And when this number is completed, you should dissolve the limb, and you know sure that it is of bones from which the beginning is not feared nor its dissolution.
And if you proceed to the location of the pelvis and wipe it clean, then you should cut over it, and remove it, and follow what has been said in the fracture of the shoulder joint of the scapula caution if it happens here.

De restauracio de la fractura del pietz" translates to "Treatment of the foot fracture" in English.
Le pietz alcunas veguadas es rompit en le mieg loc de lu e aquo tart endeve; mays las extremitats de lu mot endeve que so ciccadas e comminuidas." translates to "Some of the foot bones are broken in their place in the middle of the foot and then they bend; mainly the ends of the toes that are crooked and comminuted.

Then place your hand over the plaster and stop, and then stop the pressure of the table on the subtle swab of soap or of tweezers and of those that seem to lighten it, because you will fold it in that cloth; and then carefully place your hand on the cut bone that is not rough; and go around the ribbon on the back of some veins, and tighten that grip decently; and then consider the ribbon at all times, and when it is softened, tighten that grip.
If necessary, provoke the dissolution of that corrosive or prickling, or pain, or ecchymosis that occurs in that place, then cut and remove that and eliminate the plaster and correct what happens by that hand of cure for that; and reduce the plaster, if sometimes it affects the face; and adjust that stricture according to how it becomes healthy.
Chapter VIII.
Of the restoration of the ribs when they are twisted.
You know that a fracture of the ribs does not happen except in large locations where the two sides meet, and from the ends of them, those contractions do not occur on those cartilages but by those that are cartilaginous. I recognize that the woman is not harmed by the sentiment of the inquest of the man with the words.
The restoration should be as follows as to close the fracture with the thumb as possible, and if it is possible to close it from the side that is cut, then press and tense the broken bone with the stiletto, if necessary.
If the rib fracture is leaning towards the dentary parts, then you should go to the anus with great pain and puncture, as if you have punctured that which has bled, and for this reason to hold the casing; and you should go through this difficulty of hollowness, and throat, and vomiting of blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And the antidotes were already invented in that time by those who knew it.
And of them it is said that you should pause the intestines of the thighs that generate inflammation and effusion, so that the belly is inflated and extended, and the fracture is pushed to the side that is cut.
We would have known this for so long that it is not the cause to generate cauterization pain if it does not happen; and if it happens, then you have helped with that.
1. They advised those who had paused due to wind and instead chose to strengthen themselves; and it seems like a reasoning, but in fact, it is feared that the wind will attract excessive fluctuations to the location due to weakness.
When they were told to cover that location: make sure that the area is covered with flax that has been submerged in oil, and place pulvis between the ribs until it is full, which is the liver when it envelops the second retrusion; and properly cover the thighs with the cloth for the treatment of food poisoning and medicine.
If the pain in the thigh is very severe and does not subside, and the doctors pierce the membrane with a puncture, they should be careful about the thigh, making sure that no part of the intestine is left outside, and then removing the instrument that holds the cecum, the rememoration of which precedes, and taking out the bones that are easy to remove, and extracting that.
And if they adjust the lips of the plague, if it is large, apply ointment, and treat that within when it is healed.
If you fall into apoplexy, place your hand on the area and pour oil over it, and make sure that the thigh is covered with flax for the treatment of apoplexy, and cover the affected part with flax.

Capitol, Chapter 9.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the spine of the two and the neck.
Some have seen a fracture of the bones of the neck, and they heal to their place, and seemingly to the vertebrae of the back. And when you want to know if it is healed or not, consider that sometimes the thighs are more relaxed and stupefied and dead and cannot be moved or extended or stretched with those and when you press them with your hands or pierce them with a needle and do not feel any pain in those, then you know it is not healed, and in the months of dispositions it is mortal.
And if you feel pain in those and do not feel any in the hands or needle, then you know that the nuche of the bone is saved and that the malady does not cure much.
And if you see the spine of the neck in the same way and want to know if it is healed or not, consider the feet of the patient.
When you see that the patient has become soft, it is appropriate to apply the remedy for gout that is being applied in the most severe cases, and when you touch the patient's shoulder, you will feel a pulsation and a feeling of weakness, and some people are hunched over the shoulder and cannot urinate, then you know that it is fatal, and do not continue in the treatment of the patient.
If you do not find any cause for those symptoms, the cause is better and can be treated with less.
The treatment of the patient is that you proceed to the bedridden position of the affected limb, which is placed over the spine or the red part of the knee, or as if it were a muzzle; rest on that side while some people notice that the affected limb is sedated.
And you rest one of the ointments that are comfortable and existent, and press on that side; and command the patient to use rest and tranquility and not sleep on the part where the pain occurs before it is healed.
And if you find that the pain in the spine or any other cause separated from it, then you cover the wound on the chest and keep that bone; and adjust the corners of the mouth of the plague, if it is large; and cure that am alcu encarnatiu of the enguents, before it is healed.
If the bone of the thigh is split and the end is broken, then you cover that the tip of the other leg is inserted into the anus, and that the cut bone is tied with the other leg; and place your hand on the plaster and staple, if instructed by those, and apply that.
If you feel split thighs there, then you should touch that, and take it out, and cure the wound as soon as the disease that was previously inside is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of restoration of the widow.
The bones of the thighs are split, and if they break, then you do not know the fracture of them unless it is a communication at the ends thereof and they are inscribed on the longitud and declination in the parts of the dentates; and it happens that pain occurs in the place and puncture, and the cushion is stunned when it is broken.
And the restoration of the widow is that you extend your hand over it when it is above the fracture, and the figure of the bone is as follows.
If the fracture is at the end of the limb merely, then you should cover it with a second piece of cloth that fits snugly around it and is adjusted to its natural shape.
If the fracture is on the long or descending limb, then you should place the table over the patient's stomach, with it prepared for your restoration of that fracture. And when you have covered it with the plaster, pause over the bandage, and place a piece of cloth or rope over it, and press firmly on that to fear puncture of fracture or movement of the joint.
And cover the concavity with the cloth as you have applied it to that inside, and order the table to lie over the patient's shoulder or lie down on its side opposite to that.
If you happen to have an ecstacy cautery, then stop extending the limb and its restoration until the ecstacy cautery is sated, and place it over that piece of cloth which is next to it; and then return to the restoration of the limb and press that part as firmly as possible.
If something happens to the skull bones or are fractured, you should treat them.
This is a legal term that means "Chapter XI." It is
Of the restoration of the fracture of the assistant.
Assistant is that which is between the thigh and enters the shoulder.
If it is severed, you should restore the assistant in one of two ways, of which one is the one you hold in your hand, following this form:
They are tied with two cords, and it should be hung up from the raised place.
And follow the bone over a seat; and then let go of the hand that was on the shoulder where it entered the socket, which will come out in the place where the curve of the bone is attached.
And hang it on that heavy thing, or the master extends it to the parts outside; and then the surgeon and the fracture of the arms more easily, when the fracture returns according to what is covered.
And the other hand is that the bone is stretched over the shoulder and hangs up the collar of the arm with the cord; and then commands two surgeons, one of whom holds it so that the fracture is released from the arms more easily, and the other holds the shoulder away from it; and then they extend to their part.
If you want the extension to be tight, then you should press firmly over the fracture of the limb and over the other limb, and the two ministers will extend to their respective parts.
If the fracture is near the end of the muscle, then you should make sure that the bend of the limb is on the cushion and the other end of the fracture must be in the curve.
If the fracture is near the curve, then you should make sure that the limb is bent on that place and over the curve.
Adjust that ease and work on it, and as much as you can adjust it according to what is covered and applied in a good application, then press on it so that it does not cause cauterization.
If you cause cauterization, then relax the stricture within the seventh day, and place your hand over the wet suture linen that has become red after pausing, and then press on it.
The hand that presses on the fracture is what you plaster over the fracture, and then wrap the drape around the plaster; and adjust the arm over that assistant, and hold your hand over the curved muscle.
And pause the cloth and press upon the assistant's arms so that the arm is in place of staples, if not forbid by any cause of the broken bone.
And you use needles.
And you place the needle over the fracture point, using a different needle for each point; and place the needle between the other points at the center of the bone, and the length of the needles is according to the triangular pattern plus three times the total length.
And you tighten the needles around the stricture that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And your stricture over the location of the fracture is straight. And when the fracture is elongated, the stricture is smaller.
And if you sometimes consider the situation of the needles and the stricture as they have said in the hour when you restore the member to its usual position, then you do this.
And if you fear apoplexy cauterization, then you remove the stricture and the needles on the day of the seventh as they have said.
And you consider the limb in all parts for three days so that it does not happen in the place of pressure or inflammation; or it is prohibited that food reaches the member due to the superfluity of stricture; and then correct everything according to what they have said.
If you are over fifty years old and have not experienced any cause of gout, do not delay the application of this remedy for more than three days or less.
When the patient's pain is on the side of the bad foot and the thighs are on top of the stomach, then...
And pause on the full-grown lana engulfing the wound, and consider in total or at any time of the day that the figure of the cut member is not deliberate nor dissolved, or that the limb is mollified, therefore correct everything as much as your virtue allows.
And pause the diet of the bad foot according to the order that has been given, in case that the diet is subtle at the beginning until it comes to tighten; and you cover that you increase the diet of the one.
Four common things of the assistant and the bed of the one are that they are strong in 40 days; and you cover that they are relaxed and are administered with baths and are medicated for those who correct the ones.
And if the fracture is open, you do not remove the plaster from that limb and the pins within the days or within two months.
Chapter 12.
When it comes to the restoration of a broken arm,
The first source sentence translates to: "The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the humerus; one of them is small, and that which is said to be the elbow, and the other is large, and that which is placed laterally from the small one, from the point where it was previously cut.
This sentence translates to: "And if the larger humerus is mainly cut, or the smaller one, and they are quite carefully trimmed.
This sentence translates to: "And when the smaller humerus is cut, the restoration of the ligament and the care of the patient are placed in ligatures.
This sentence translates to: "And when the larger humerus is cut, the fracture of the bone is bad, and the care of the patient is difficult.
This sentence translates to: "And it is bad when the bones are cut without being carefully trimmed.
This sentence translates to: "Therefore, if the bone that is cut is the smaller humerus, it is convenient for the surgeon to do the restoration of the bone, which is made as small as possible, in order to facilitate the entry into the joint when it is reduced.
When a large cold is present that is condensed, it is necessary to cover with a thin cloth.
If the two colds are condensed together, then cover with a thin cloth to stop the extraction of the flesh.
If you cover the figure of the face, then restore the restoration of the ear and extend it over a cushion, and place the fingers on the parts of the ear that are said, and the eyeball is placed below the other words, and the thigh is placed on a pillow.
If a cushion is placed under the knee or foot of the patient, so that the thigh does not become tired.
If the physician extends the arm of the affected side in front with his hand, and another physician extends it similarly.
If the surgeon cuts the bones that are entering that second better figure that can be.
If in the fact of the bone there are staggers, then you must cut through all of it in the right place for your virtue.
If in that separate part you find that the stomach has been cut and it is not what you expect for its restoration, then you should stay on him and leave that second hand that they have told you to use.
If the fracture is not inflamed, and you have already made a similar case, then take the care of that one.
If you meet an apoplexy at the beginning of your restoration, then you should line a cloth that is suitable and red with olive oil and white wax, and it should be between precision and subtlety, and press the cloth over the one that is causing the subtle clot in that apoplexy; and you should remove the cloth and pause the plaster prepared from the powder of mud clay, and then pause the stela; and that stela should be the one placed over the fracture with a few and with force.
You know that the number of the stelas of the arm you saw in the larger arrangements, or is the fracture in a single or two focils?
And then pause your stricture over the site of the fracture, which is often painful and violent, and when you lessen the traction on the parts of the fracture or on the lower parts of the limb, pause the stricture a little more until after the rememoration of the limb at the beginning of the capital.
The cuffs that envelop the fracture are not very tight, nor are they hard or rough, and the one that fits best is the one that is most similar between delicate and large, as they have advised.
Consider the member and its limb on different days. And if you encounter any cause for which rectification is necessary, make sure that the limb is well covered with wet cloth, and keep it so until the heat ceases that caused the pain.
And make sure the member does not constrict while it rests, and then return the stricture.
And if the traction has already softened and the bone has become stronger and similar to those, then you should correct everything as much as possible with your virtue.
When considering whether the nutrition is prohibited from reaching the member due to superfluity of stricture, it is necessary to know that those who cover that part with soft materials make it smaller and lessens it over time as the nutrient passes through it, and strengthens it.
If nothing happens to the thigh during that time, those who have said it are not necessary to be slid within 20 days or further from there.
Then it is suspended the mouth of the thigh for its virtue of movement, and makes that sleep on the soft side of the body.
Do you know that this fracture is restored in xxx days or in xxxii days, or rather in xxviii days, and then it follows the arrangement of the complications and the arrangements of the virtue?
Chapter thirteen.
Of restoration of fracture of the thumb of the thigh and of the joints.
Do you know that the thumb of the thigh and the joints are fragile, and they do not happen to them except by visible watched movements.
When a fracture or dislocation occurs, you should cover the thigh with a cloth and make it lie down in a position that maintains equality of the limbs, and then stop the movement of the thigh over that extended part.
And then the surgeon extends the cut bones and the muscle around them as much as possible, making sure that the bone ends are well-aligned with good congruence.
And you should cover the wound with plaster and stop it if there is no attack of gangrene; and then stop the application according to the size of the wound, and you have already covered that in cloth.
If the sprain is in the joints of the fingers, you should make it seem like a glove of drapery, and command the patient to hold their hand tight with the affected finger; then your drapery should be long enough.
And if the bandage is placed on the arm in such a way that the arm is raised, because the arm is applied to the hand; and then hold it tightly.
If the fracture is in the parts of the fingers, you should cover that and place another bandage on the part of the finger just on the palm, so that the hand is open and dry; and then stop the constriction, as it is rolled around the ring between the fingers.
If an injury occurs to any of the bones of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, cut along the bone and expose it as much as possible, and then apply a bandage to the palm and tie it with a knot so that the fracture is elevated and not painful.
If the fracture is in any other finger, then cut along the bone as in that particular location, or in the index, or the earlobe, or the anus, and expose it as much as possible; or they are all similar in continuity, and it is better; or stop on that small table, as they have said in the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and accordingly to that, the disposition of counter-aposteme and oppose — as in the second operation — I think that it covers when any cause occurs to those, according to the narrative of the one.
Chapter XIV.
Of the restoration of a bone fracture of the thigh.
The bones of the thigh that are visible are cut and declared to be in line with the feeling that it converts to the exit point and the pus becomes absorbed.
The restoration of the patient is made in such a way that one limb is placed over the fracture and another limb further down the fracture, and the body is positioned on its stomach with the face down.
Then the physician extends the entire limb to its full length according to the quality of the bone in the location of the fracture.
If it is necessary to straighten the knee, then place the limb directly against the leg bone, so that the extension catches in the patellar tendon, and the other limb further down the fracture.
If the reduction seems to be in place, then place the limb directly against the tension, and let the extension be at the joints.
And the surgeon aligns the bone as much as possible within the joint, taking into account the reduction that corresponds to the natural position and the bone is properly united by good union; then apply plaster and stricture, if not causing injury to the member. If injury occurs in the appendix, then take that out within a few days after it has become soft, and return to your care.
When the stricture of the patient's wound is: cover that envelopes over the fracture with a hard needle, bend it into two or three loops, and hold it tightly; and then envelop the chamber within which the talus and the root of the toe pass.
Introduce a long pin between the toe and the chamber of the denol to the parts on either side, and let the ends of the pin extend outside the part. Then revolve it over the chamber and the toe as much as necessary to cover the hard needle.
And place your hand over the toe at the location of that fracture, and place a stone over the bones of the chamber.
And make the spaces between the chamber and the toe as small as possible, so that the stricture is coagulated.
And begin the stricture with a hard covering over the location of the fracture in three or four layers, and as you move away from the location of the fracture, your stricture will become smaller and hold more.
When extending the ends of the urethra to the parts inside that have reached the cavity of the foot, and tightly holding the ends of the other parts so that the member does not become twisted in its place.
And then apply the strain over that, so that it does not happen to the corrosive or posthumous cautery nor to the emflacio and similar things; and if any cause happens to those, then cut off a part of this, and correct the whole according to what has been said by the wise.
If the bone is not in the bone that is placed, then you understand that this following one is possible for you; otherwise, cover that and remove it, and cure the remaining one and care for the one that precedes the remembrance within which it is healed.
And if some things are tightly holding this fracture of the thigh or another one that is adjusted to those bones, then as has been said in the auxiliary and in the arm,
But nevertheless in the restoration of that it is not necessary for the claudication to happen to the thigh; and if it is restored alone or another one that is applied to the other camba, then you must have that which is to be stretched from that which is coldest.
You should know that the thigh muscle is tightened for 40 days or a few months, and this depends entirely on the variety of complexes and other structures.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the text you provided is not
The translation of "De restauracio de la fractura de la rodela del denolh" is:
You know that a fracture of the rib cage around the navel does not usually happen during walking or running.
If an injury does occur to the rib cage, it is usually a split or tear in the ribs, and that causes pain all over the body, and everything is then felt as pain.
The restoration of the ribs is usually what causes pain, as it is torn apart and pulled apart by the muscles, as indicated by the symptoms that are added and connected in order to achieve equilibrium and ease of use and production.
And place plaster on the affected area and put pressure on that round part; and tighten the bandage as much as possible.
And consider all the dispositions that have been recommended for other fractures, as it is important to postpone caution and appear similar to those who suffered accidents of this kind and are now recovering, as it is convenient within what is healthy for you.
Chapter 16.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the pelvis.
You should know that in the thigh there are two bones of which one is large and the other is small, and they are named after the thigh itself; the other is thin and is called the "thigh bone.
And you should know that when fractures of this kind occur in the two bones of the arm, and for that reason a restoration is made of the shoulder like a restoration of the arm fracture, and the operation is one.
And if the three bones are tied together, the thigh is converted into all parts.
And if the small bone is tied together, the thigh is converted into the parts of Denant.
And if the large bone is tied together, it will cause damage to that part, and those causes are not known to you.
And apply extension, equalization, and ligation of the muscles according to that fracture.
However, if the fracture of the thigh is not caused by motionless bones, then extension should be tighter and more gentle, and it will benefit your virtue.
When there is a cause for operation on the arm, and when you uncover the staples and complete the entire operation, then take iron nails of the kind that are placed further away from the causes that are placed further away from the sole, and so make it look white like palm fronds; smooth out those that are close to the ones that have a small amount of grease, and do not cause pain to the hands, and be as long as the ones you take from the camber, and from the denel that comes from the pus.
And around each drap, wrap it in envelopes according to the length of the intestine, and place one over the end of the camber of one part and the other part of the other, and they are from the denel that comes from the pus within the foot.
And you have the draps stapled in three locations of the drap extremities and at the middle location, where this structure of the camber is prohibited from clinical use on the right and left sides, and it is good for alignment.
And already an administrator of nails according to the length of the camber has been given; and it is placed on the camber by the camber that maintains that of movement.
When you really need to break something, and when that is truly necessary.
And consider in each day the camba and study it for derivation of studies, and you guard against rupture and inflammation or other similar causes; and when any cause of those occurs, you must stop what you are doing that is truly necessary to heal.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the ankle and the bones of the foot and toes.
In the ankle, fracture does not occur in total; rather, the bones of the foot have some fractures; and the toes of the foot do not have fractures, and they do not fracture except for dislocation in the joints.
And if the bones of the foot are fractured and sometimes those bones are raised above each other between them, you should stop the intestine on the ground prepared as follows:
And place the other foot on that which is raised above those bones, and calm it, and press it, and cut it when it turns in the joints.
And then apply a plaster and stop, and place on the abdomen of the foot a small table with two caps plastered on.
And then stretch that to the foot that you have wrapped in cloths and other causes of which it indicates.
And when the three days or four have passed, you will remove the limb, and then you will find the bones engaged, or they are fractured or dislocated, and the operation in those will be done with stitches.
If they are said to be dislocated, you will restore them, and engage those as you and I recommended in the restoration of those that you mentioned. And then place the second dislocation on the second part of the foot that you mentioned, and put a little oil on it; and then place the foot on this table that I recommended to you and stretch that to the extent indicated by me.
If these are two or three or more dislocations of the bones, then you will stretch over each part of the foot that is wrapped in cloth, and then stretch the table over the end of the foot so that it holds well on the abdomen of the foot.
It is convenient for you to not overlook that you do not consider all causes that I have said in the other fractures of the accidents that they have told you; and it is good for you to know all accidents that come to me.
Capitol, Chapter XVIII.
Of the fracture of the humerus bone and the fifth metacarpal bone and the big toe joint.
When the humerus bone is broken, make that incision in the same direction as the fall, and then bend it slightly towards the end of the two, and hold it behind.
And the midwife should cut the humerus bone and make it as the thigh; and the woman should be crushed, and raise the two of the little one by one, until all of that is out of the part of the humerus bone and the fifth metacarpal bone returns.
And place powders on the back of the child, and when you want to urinate, make the fifth metacarpal bone easier and urinate, and reduce it and return that second to the first hand that was used at the beginning, and return to the first powder.
When the wound is not healed after seven days or more, that person will recover.
If you want, take once a week a piece of sheep's intestine and strengthen the wound of the person with a canula of canna; and enter all the vesicle into the chest cavity, and appropriately infuse through the canula as much as the vesicle is inflamed due to the chest cavity, so that the fracture returns.
And make sure it is completely healed and stay for several days after they have recommended, until it is completely healed.
When the bones of the penis or vagina are broken, administer in the restoration and application of water as recommended in the bone of the ankle.
And water that is dry is not hidden in these proximal fractures and has little end, mainly because of the one who studies and understands this free mot; for that fracture means to you in the major dispositions via dry in the restoration and in the stricture of the, and then you know.
When the joint of a man is swollen, take garlic from any place, and put it in that; and then cover it with the cloth envelope, and keep it for three days or more, and it will be cured.
Capitol, Chapter XIX.
Of the restoration of bone fractures when they are infected.
It is convenient for that to which the fracture has occurred, and especially if the bones are large, such as the thigh bone or the helper bone, or seeming to be that, which you cut and suture at that time so much, if the conditions of suture are good with you or have testified that there is any other way.
And if the swelling disappears quickly, you should know that you have cut the correct amount of the substance that you squeezed on the edge of the wound, if there is no other cause.
And then begin to restore the fracture on that day, and do not delay, if there is no other complication.
If you have an asthma attack, you should restore the patient's condition within nine days, if possible, and do not delay it for more than three days after the attack, as you will make other accidents happen.
If the bone is protruding through the skin, you should cover that part with a cloth to prevent infection and reduce pain as much as possible and with minimal effort and extension.
If the extension is not prepared and the force of the blow is on the muscle, you should reduce the part as much as possible with this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, its length is seven or eight inches, and its latitude is according to the quantity of the fracture; and for that reason it is necessary for the surgeon to grasp those three or four according to the quantity you indicate in the treatment throughout the specialty of fracture.
And it should be reduced, and there should be little tension on that part at the time of the operation, as you do not want to double the compression.
When it comes to sharp extremities that are marred by the feet's edges; and the doctor's hand is greatly extended, and the patient's body enters into parts.
This is the form of it:
When it is necessary to reduce a hernia or protrusion, the Greek term "labre volentz atelarem" is often used. This term is quite rare and not commonly used in everyday language. It seems to be a medical term related to
To prevent the top of the affected limb from being raised above the top of the prominent bone, it should be placed at a lower level. This is to ensure proper blood circulation and prevent further injury or discomfort.
Then, the area should be compressed with a bandage or wrap, and it should be secured in place so that it does not shift or move around. This will help to maintain the pressure and prevent further injury or discomfort.
To compress the fractured ends of the bone together, and if the end of the broken limb is slightly bent, and you do not apply too much pressure on it, then you should be careful to ensure that the end of the affected bone is inside the instrument before applying any force. This will help to prevent further injury or damage to the bone.
If you are unable to reduce the bone completely, then you should try to identify the exact location of the fracture using the information provided by the patient or any available X-rays. Alternatively, you can use a bone saw to cut through the bone and expose the fracture site. This will allow you to access the fracture and attempt to realign the bones.
And so pay attention to that which is rough in the bones and hardened muscles.
And when the bones are reduced, and the pain in the thigh is greatly alleviated, you will understand that the bones do not return to their original position; and then make sure to confirm the reduction with your hand.
When you have completed your restoration of the bone, and you submerge your hand in sterile black grease, and especially if it is summer, and do not press on the plague cartilage or any other cause in which there may be a suture or other cause that may affect the healing and cure.
And administer stitches at the time of the highest complement of the bone restoration, and leave the discovered plague undisturbed that has been inserted by the surgeon and used according to the amount of plague.
And be very careful not to strain the plague on the fracture, that no more motas will be made by the metges, and do not cause harm to the dead or decaying bones or corners, which is quite unpleasant. If the second stricture were to be more rigid, it would be softer and different from the strictures of other fractures.
If the plague is large or the plague is bad, and you are afraid of those accidents that have happened in the past, and pain occurs in that place, then you should not cover that parts with your hands, less force on that enclosure of hard cloths in the place of stakes and stretch it with your hand.
When the plague has begun to appear, that is generated by the skin, then you should take off the cloth that was placed over it and administer ointments, seek for those that are not of our custom and which we use to treat the plague, and when you find tetrafarmacon and similar to that.
It is recommended that you remove the linen and consider the plague every day in the morning and evening after it has been consolidated and closed, and cover that member with such preparation that the ointment runs from it to the parts away for ease.
If in the plague there are several days that have passed and it has not been consolidated nor abscised from the cloth, then you know that here are signs of the small ones for which you should inquire about the plague. When those sore spots are separated and not removed, those that do not separate and cause the member to bend and cause pain, then insert your finger there where it is possible for you.
If you encounter the plague or pus, it is stinking, or another form of corruption and putrefaction, then know that you must press on one of those parts that is appropriate for the cure of the one mentioned in the previous chapter of this book.
And from that in which you cover that your speech and you present your hand: when it becomes large, lean over the member as the eye and helper are, and seem like those of the large members, and do not presume to attract or remove from it, nor the extraction of it that many wounds occur for this death; having that within which may be pus, which falls on it for about twenty days or thirty; and you cure the plague if you see it, and if not, lay it.
Chapter 20.
When treating a swelling that occurs in the skin of any fracture.
When visible twitching occurs in this therapy of fracture care, and particularly when it affects joints, and is observed through the figure of the member; and therefore it strongly forbids the member from its natural operation.
It is also considered whether the therapy is recent and administered in those medicines that have sterilized alcohol, essence, oil, and acne, and other similar diseases; in which case it is advisable to take some or all of them, and apply them on the therapy to the nodation according to what has been sterilized with alcohol, essence, or oil, and then place those over the therapy on a good constraint.
And the extraction that does not leave that part open; and if it does, then do so and repeat another, until that nodation is reduced; or press firmly on that lamina of plum, which has the property of remaining totally inflated as much as possible in the members.
If the nodation has already been converted into stone and is strained, and causes the other part to become hard, and divides that per the part of the pus raised by the abscess, and incises the superfluity and eminent, or ratz that enters when it is inflated; and cares for that within which it is cured.
The first line of the text is "Capitol .xxi." which
When restoring a fracture, if it is restored and appropriate to Roman medicine, the member is subtle and free, not following the natural course.
When a bone fracture is restored, and instead of that, the subtle member and limb are reduced, then nothing is done except for motions caused: of which one is a multitude of solutions of the ligament and the luxation of the joint does not follow that covers; or for superfluity of stricture of the ligaments within which nutrients are prohibited from reaching the member; or for superfluity of embrocation; or for movement that is too soon; or for insufficiency of sanctions in the body of the patient and debauchery of it.
The first source sentence translates to: "In the treatment of this condition, a warm bath is given to the affected area and the limb is stretched so that the pain becomes less severe in it; and then the gauze and linen are applied over the affected part.
And then place a bandage on the member, so that the bandage attracts the nutrient to it, or continues to irrigate the dry matter, if that nutrient corresponds and returns to its natural figure.
Capital. Chapter XXII.
Of the treatment of the three-knuckle bones when they are restored tortuously and it is forbidden to operate on them from now on.
When you happen to the restored member according to the sanation of the tortuosity and eminence on the three-knuckle bone, and it is because of this that the member is fed with a different form, but the member is not prohibited from the natural operation, if it does not exist that the member is of another trinity.
It has already been said that many fools have been doctors and restorers who have done this in our land; and this operation is feared by many because of the severity of the one who does it, which is mortal.
If claudication and nodulation are recent, it is feared that they are filled with wet matter in the one who has them, as if they were fuels of altitude and roughness of the face, and resemblances to those; and it should be made with the same plaster as the mollification of the plaster; or that it is a mucilage of the roughness of the face and is mixed with gray of gualina or am oli of cirami, and is applied to that; or that they are fatty grasses and are twisted with the fingers of the colon, and resemble those of the medicines that are called consolidacio.
When certain women are dissolved by frequent rubbing of the skin that is dry and wet, and the movement of the member is administered to all parts in all hours.
If tortuosity has already become apparent and is hard and converted into stone and necessitates medical attention of the iron, you should know that the pus is below the cecum and the continuity of the bone is dissolved, and it should be recognized that superfluous nodosity of those metals in the bones is subtle, and there should be ease in that for the solvent and study.
Chapter 23.
On the Sermon on Dislocation.
Dislocation is an example of one of the joints of the upper limb, for which movement is prohibited, and the figure of the member is ordered, and great pains and injuries come on the thigh.
Therefore, when you meet with a dislocation, you should perforate as much as possible to reduce it, and do not delay in reducing it, for if it is delayed, the joint becomes inflamed and very difficult to reduce the dislocation.
When it is not desired that there be any swelling or hardness in the hour of the operation, fourteen watches have been observed to cause spasm and pain.
If this happens, it is necessary that you lie down on the abdominal incision of the patient, and place your hand over where the apostematic wound was made; and the member should be wrapped in cold water and olive oil, and the red part should be made easier.
And all parts of the body are treated with this that the memories will come to their place.
And you have already ordered the displacements of the dislocations according to what follows after fracture; from the side of the chest that is swollen, go towards the opposite side.
Chapter 24.
Of the cure of a dislocation of the jaw on the side.
If the mandibles are dislocated and do not fit, and the dislocation of the teeth is caused by two reasons: either they are pulled out of their sockets with little force and become soft; or they are completely dislocated and forced in, and they must be softened at the joint between the cheek and the throat, so that they do not hurt to open the mouth and do not close it with the tongue.
When the displacement of the part is slight, it returns to its original position due to a small cause.
If the dislocation is complete and well-defined, you should make sure that the reduction of the joint is made without delay.
When the physician holds the patient's head, and enters one hand into the mouth of the affected jawbone, if the dislocation is in one part, he takes out the tooth; or if he enters his two hands into the mouth, if the dislocation is in multiple parts, and the others are loosened as much as possible, he commands the patient to stop biting and releases the teeth that have been pulled out; and the physician then engages the jawbone and extracts it, dislocating it when it returns to its original position.
If it is difficult to reduce the joint, and especially if the mandibles are found to be dislocated, apply epidural anesthesia with water and oil, and if there is any reduction of the dislocation, do not delay the reduction of the dislocations of all, as they have said.
And when they return and the jaws are closed, and the patient's mouth is not closed, you should rest on those powders of drap, and it will be easy to remove the wax; and you should have some ointment with cera and oil rose.
If the patient's leg is placed on the bed, and the head of the patient is between two horns, so that it does not touch the right or left side; and do not force any cause; if the patient's leg has the cross of St. Leon, then when the pain becomes worse and the jaw is not swollen, you will know that it is the correct one.
If it is administered easily, and you do not worry about the aperture of the mouth, the food and drink, and the swallowing, then if the jaw is swollen and healthy.
If it is difficult to reduce two jaws when they are dislocated at some time and not converted into their proper places, then you must make frequent movements, and often take fever and soda, and the stomach of the patient is much affected, and the patient often vomits pure choler.
When you see that loss is occurring, then you know that it is being lost in those days for x days.
Chapter 25.
This sentence seems to be discussing the reduction of a dislocation of the shoulder and the end of the muscle. Here's a possible translation:
A gout is not dislocated from the elbow due to its continuous pressure on the chest; and some veins are dislocated to the affected area, and this is declared by the sensation.
And the restoration of the patient consists in placing the thigh on the table and extending the thigh bones. And cut the area with your hand using a strong force, so that it returns.
And place your hand over the plaster and powder, and press on that.
The end of that which is held by the thigh is not dislocated at any time; you must reduce and enlarge it according to what has been said and according to what appears to you.
And place your hand over the plaster, powder, and stretcher, and command the patient to hold tight to the tightness and to relax when it is healed.
And with this medication, the end of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from the table.
Chapter 26.
When reducing the displacement of the muscle.
You know that the muscle is not dislocated but in three ways, of which one is dislocated from the beginning of the tendon to the end of the foot.
And the second is that it is dislocated at the beginning of the muscle, and this is called tendon; and it is not dislocated in the backs by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in the fronts by the nerves.
And primarily, the muscle is dislocated and deformed at the end of the tendon, and primarily in those where the bones are few, it is not dislocated; less in those where the muscles are many, it is difficult to do so.
And many people are injured by percussion or castration, and the muscle of the man is pulled out by castration, and this is why it was already dislocated.
I advise you to do this when you are above the serf, and you must proceed in the care of the man.
When you recognize the dislocation of the joint when it is beyond the parts that you should touch; because you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the other muscle, which you stretch among those different manifestations; and you stretch at the head of the concave muscle and at the end of the titillation, you must touch the head of the dislocated muscle as if it were a hou, and not allow the entire movement to be reduced to the upper part of the cheek, nor to the lower part.
If it is dislocated, you must either reduce or stretch it, and you must stretch the muscle's touch without being afraid.
And for this dislocation, a slight reduction is made when it is fresh and the thigh is young.
And the reduction of the joint is that the minister raises the head of the joint to its parts; and he places the hands on the end of the titillation, and strengthens the junction in its own location, and the minister raises the head of the joint, and extends it there; and he pauses it so that it returns gently.
If it does not return after the first day, and since the dislocation began, then days later, you will find that the thigh is swollen with water and is being maintained with a mucilaginous and linen bandage, like a thick cloth of flax, and honey in water, and it is administered.
And the thigh is placed on the patient's back and is held there until the titillation of the expectorant linen is between liftation and stricture, and the surgeon places the thigh on the abdomen, elevates the head of the muscle that is vertuous, and presses the mass of the thigh against the points that are far away, and another servant holds the thigh in place so that it is not harmful to the points that are far away, until such time as it returns to its original position.
And if you want, reduce that second maneuver: and it is because you are showing a man who has a long thigh, and is from the side of that latz, and enters the patient's thigh muscle with the titillation of the thigh and elevates the titillation of the thigh to the points where the thigh is suspended in the air, and another servant pulls the mass of the thigh away from the points that are far away from the patient's abdomen. When the thigh is inflamed, you should cover it with something that is warmer than the other causes, because it is more severe, and the dislocation returns as much as possible.
When the joint is reduced and another hand is used: and it remains on the ground a long one of whose head is like a brick, as a pillow, which is neither too thick nor too fine, and is placed at the end of the thigh; push that the reduction is on the top of the head of the log, and the thigh is in line with the length of the log, and extend the hand of the other part over the parts on the other side; and extend the chest of the other part for strength, so that the joint returns to its original position quickly.
If the reduction is difficult due to all the causes that have been said, use this treatment: and it is that you take a log of the size that is on two braces, and its length is four feet, and the largest part of it is placed in the cradle of the tittilic according to this form:
And place a pillow on the head that is like a brick so that the thigh does not fall.
And place the hand on the end of the tittilic, and extend the hand or the arm over the log within the parts on the other side, and see if the log is on the assistant and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
And if you want to support the arm on a scale according to the latitude, and the other is extended to the parts beyond that, and the other is suspended from the other side, so that the joint does not come out too much.
And when the joint of your finger is completed according to whatever method you can possibly follow, and you notice that you are holding the tip of the nail with too much force; and then apply a plaster made of powdered glass and almond oil over all the muscle, as far as it is possible to rotate it, and then tighten the joint with a stricture; and the ligament be rotated over the plaster, and your finger's nail be annexed to the collar of your finger, and it should be lessened, and not cause any harm to your finger for seven days.
And if you notice that the food of the thigh is lessened, then when that member is comfortable, it should be pushed to the sanctuary of the body.
And if the food is given more or less in seven or eight days, and if it is not softened, then you are already cured.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
If the joint remains swollen and does not subside after about three days, and the plaster and stricture are reduced over some parts, and it does not hold and cannot raise the arm to those parts, you should know that the nerves of that muscle have already been injured or extended or softened, and you should know that the joint will not remain in place for long.
For the dislocation of that which is caused, you must reduce and compress the chest and the nipples or the parts behind, and the reduction is made by impulse and extension to the maximum, until it returns.
And if another stricture is administered, and care is taken of that within until it is healed.
If the healing takes place heavily in the member and slows down the movement of that, you should use the grip with movements that are as wide as possible until that heaviness is relieved and returns to its original nature.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided text is not a complete sentence or a
Of the cure of hip dislocation.
You should know that the joint of the thigh is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and this is dislocated to all parts, and most particularly to the parts adjacent to the parts behind, and the displacement of the knee is not affected by your effort to stretch or to touch it subsequently whatever figure is dislocated, and when you adjust the dislocated joint in the socket, that is clearly declared to you, that the joint is concave and cannot be bent by the arm, nor touched by that muscle.
E covers that which coigns, and reduces the displacement as much as possible until it comes to the gout cautery, where if you see the gout cautery, it is difficult to reduce it, and more difficult to heal of all; and most particularly when it is to the parts behind, where there is a bad effect on all other species of dislocation, and greater pain, and motions seen are sent to that the death.
And the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the hand of it is extended as much as possible, and the arm of it is expanded, and the most of the doctors are over the thigh and below it, and they press on the joint with their fingers or with the tip of their thumb, or with the nail of their little finger, when it turns in its place.
If the displacement is in the parts that are doubled, then return the hand that bends the arm at the elbow joint, entering where it touches the palm of the hand.
And if the displacement does not comply with the reduction, then apply vehement extension and strong movement.
And it is that two ministers extend the arms, and hold them with those two ministers so that the extension is not fatigued.
And if the rotation of the arms is needed for all parts, then it is necessary to double the arm around the body or limb.
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, apply some oil for that so that those causes that help in lubrication of the joint are facilitated; and then press the joint with a strong push entering where it returns.
And the reduction of the part that is placed on that bandage which is sterile and excreta albumin from the blood, and is extrenhut am strictura descent, and the arm is hung from the collarbone, and is laid for several days.
When the joint is formed in the proper location, then you should smoothly slide it and press on that.
If you see that the joint is not tight, then you should repeatedly apply plaster and the limb, and press on it for several days until it becomes swollen; then smoothly slide it.
If something happens to the joint and its reduction becomes unstable, and its position is in motion, then you should apply moisture in a bath and gentle pressure, and compression, within which it is allowed to be released; or pause over the reduced joint, as it is a heavy-moving part of the body; and smoothly slide it over the bone and the nail. And hold it there, and put it in a bath; and when you dry it, then you should gently rub the joint with pressure, and smoothly slide it over the reduced part, which is heavy-moving, one direction and then the other, and the third. I am immersed in a bath, within which it is limited.
And if you want, pause over the wet and slicked horn of the cow, pressing on its border and tightening it; and make some sliding movements, until that part is dry and reduced to its position.
The first line of the text is not in English, but in a language that is somewhat
Regarding the treatment of shoulder dislocation, it is the joint between the arm and the chest that is affected.
When some part of the body is suddenly dislocated, and its reduction is difficult, and the contrary is seen in other joints, yet it does not necessarily mean that speed is lacking in reducing this joint at the time of displacement, because the location may be herniated or may have occurred in a hernia caut.
And the reduction of the dislocation of the joint is that you place the joint of the patient's thigh over a table and extend the joint of that leg, and the doctor places his hand or palm on the incoming joint, and presses it inward until it returns to its original location.
Yet it is not always certain that the hand has been placed on the abdomen of the patient, and if the joint is reduced, the doctor should place both hands on the table to extend and reduce; and if the dislocation is prior, the doctor should be in the position of the joint of that part naturally on the table, so that the doctor's hand covers the incoming joint.
And if you return as soon as possible, it is good; and if not, extend the hand that is being pushed aside, and do not ignore this, because if you do not suffer or cannot overcome the reduction of the joint in the days that follow, it will be difficult to treat.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out. And then let it rest and be relaxed for days; and then let it slide and be relaxed and the muscle of the thigh be exercised.
If the movement of the thigh is not stopped and occurs in it any severity, then you should gently apply wet cloths and warm friction on some parts, until it is relieved.
Capitulare Bollandianum, book 29.
Of the care of dislocation of the fingers.
Some fingers are dislocated at the tip of the finger.
And if a finger is dislocated at the side of the palm or in the belly of the hand, then you should stop the finger and push the dislocation of the finger with the thumb, until it returns to its place.
When supporting the head of the patient, and holding that part which is dislocated, and releasing it after two days.
And hold that part and extend it within the direction in which the limb is bent on that day.
And when it is painful, follow that second instruction and do not continue to slide it in the day and exercise your movement, and then repeat it at night; and do this for several days until it becomes straight.
And make it seem like you are doing this, if it is dislocated in the abdomen of the man and hold that part and then do the second operation within two days when it is healed.
And in the same way, when it is dislocated in other parts.

Of the treatment of displacement of the vertebrae of the feet.
When any of the vertebrae of the foot or neck is dislocated completely, and there are many more vertebrae in that location, it is not treated, and death occurs in the thighs.
When it comes to the matter of diarrhea, it is expelled from the body against one's will, and cannot be retained; and if watched, it softens the members of the patient or the changes in the member or the two braces of the member, or a spine in that location, for which many have been watched and many have been made to remove them in four parts.
And now it has been divided into segments behind and is no longer uncomfortable.
The cure of the patient depends on whether the diarrhea is due to puberty, as in that case neither the one nor the other is cured or healed.
In that case, whether it is due to castration or percussion or seeming as if it is due to them, the ancients had many ways of curing diarrhea, of which the best is to return to the one that lacks too much of the body's own heat, due to its proximity to the exposed part of the body, which I have expelled and formed with various instruments of that kind, which I show you now and spread it.
If those are not cured but only in the ones that occur in the two feet, then it is recommended to you.
If the patient's thigh is extended over his face, close to the part of the body, and is extended further down, it is recommended that you not cut the chest.
And if a rod is placed, let it be placed on the ground at the end of the thigh around the head of the patient, and another rod on the other end of the thigh.
He holds the rod, and does not stop in the pit; and another one holds the other in that form.
And he covers the head of the patient and closes the tip with a lever; and extend the end of the lever to the rod that you have to hold the head of the patient, and fix it there; and tighten the other lever on the ankles of the legs, and adjust all the levers and fix them on the other rod that you have to hold the feet.
And if the minister of the crown extends the girdle to the parting of the thigh, and does not make the two thighs and the girdles of the same parts tight, it is not certain whether they will fit as they have said.
The doctor places his hands over the spine for strength as he returns, or places them on one table and adjusts the weight of the legs as they return.
If he does not return in this way, one must take a table where the latitude or longitude is at least three degrees, and dig into the side of the same table, where it has been said that a place for the tail is found between the extremities of the table. And he places the tail of the table over the spine, and the doctor places the legs on the other end, and stretches well until the spine is straight and returns to the original position.
And if you wish, open the one that rotates with the mallet; and it is that you must place the cap on the end of the tail in the derier of the plug two thighs, the longitude of which is a brace, and the cap must be placed in the derier of the plug and most two thighs; and the longitude that is between any one thigh and a palm, and it has been made in any one thigh as it turns, and any one must remain on land because it is not good.
If a joint is swollen and turned inward, and it is rotating in the two grooves of the two bones, then...
In the end of it there is a groove in which the joint is formed, and its length is like that, and in the other two bones it seems like that...
And then stretch the ligaments that you have tightened in the chest of the patient in the groove that you must place at the top of the thigh, and the ligaments that you have stretched in the joints of the thigh in the groove that you must place at the ankle of the thigh.
And you must treat each joint and it is a master that twists the joint at its will, and he engages the spine according to what they have said.
E if the spine is returned and the location is engaged, then you must press on the excised part of the bladder with your hand, and stop; and place over the excised part of the table that has a latitude of three degrees or more around it, and a longitude that is as much as the part takes from the yellowish part, and over the end of the spine sa.

If some warnings of impending danger appear in the back of the spines of both sides, and it is caused by that dislocation; and those are the ones that have already appeared for which it is not necessary to cover that this medicine is harmful to you, as much as I can advise you to add death.
Capital.xxxi. (This line seems to be a reference or a heading
Of the cure of a dislocated ankle.
You know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the muscle do not always cause dislocation, but only when it happens to those that happen to the other small removals and concavitations.
When the joint of the wide part is dislocated, it is displaced in four ways: either to the dentals, or to the inferior parts, or to the nasal parts, or to the posterior parts.
If it is mainly dislocated to the dental parts, and less so to the nasal or posterior parts.
The dislocation of the joint to the dental parts is four times more common when you adjust the thigh's muscle according to the healthy thigh, it becomes long and hangs down lower than the healthy one, and the thigh cannot bend at the hip, and that is the place where you have to use an apostema cautery, because the end of the thigh has already come here.
The reason for the dislocation being more common in the inferior parts is that the accidents of the joint are opposite to this one.
The reason for the dislocation being more common in the nasal parts is that the muscle of the joint expands according to the complement, but it does not bend the pain that is in the nasal part, and if it perforates to go ahead, it cannot be over the nasal parts; and the urine of the patient is retained and the engorgement of the penis is apostema, and you must place the ambulance over the sole.
When there is a sudden displacement of the joint due to injury, it is because the ligament does not expand or cannot bend that part of the ligament which bends around it, and the thigh is slightly higher than the other, and the joint is softened, and the end of the thigh is at that place.
The reduction of the parts of this displacement is that you consider, doctor, if the displacement is old and antiquated, that it has already been treated with the same method of reduction by another physician in the past, and therefore it is not necessary to repeat the same treatment in that part; and then it does not seem to be a matter of importance.
In the case of a recent displacement, and one of the four types of dislocation, you should carefully examine the joint and extend it to the parts behind and in front, and then to the right and left, for if it returns without needing another treatment, it is a sign that the reduction was successful.
If the displacement does not return in this maneuver, you should know that you are dealing with a severe case and extend the thigh further forward, or to the side, or to the tendon which is stretched over the ligament; and another maneuver extends the leg further away from the hip, and stretches the tendon over the joint; and hold another maneuver on the lower part of the thigh and hold the end of the tendon.
When the extension of the patient or the part where the ankle is bent to the hip, or to the back of the heel, it is customarily called a sprain by doctors.
And if the extension of all those is in one vein entering the foot, and it is raised above the ground and hangs down.
This kind of extension is peculiar to all four.
And if the dislocation returns as said, then so be it; and otherwise, you must do whatever is necessary for the cure of that specific case.
In the reduction of the own, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is in the parts bent, cover that the foot is stretched over the shoulder; and place the limb on the side of the ankle to the location where the langoure ends, and extend the limb from the ankle to the part of the furcula.
And another minister firmly grasps the hooves, and pulls the large end of the foot up, and extends the parts near it with great force, so that it returns to its original position.
This speciality is used for this kind of care, which reduces this member compared to the other kinds.
If you excuse me and follow this rule of this kind of care, then you know that the two feet of the patient are tied together with a strong, thin string, over the toes and the nails.
And the length of each part is proportional to the number of four, and the thigh is extended more than the other by two digits.
And the thigh is hung over the head of the chest, and it should be in the most; and the length of it is equal to two braces.
And command a young man to cut off the head of the thigh, and hang it on another young man's chest, and the other young man pulls the thigh back to strengthen it, so that the joint returns to its original position quickly.
But in the reduction itself, if there is a dislocation at the part that has been separated, know that the thigh is placed on the other side according to what has been recommended in the case of the femur; and it should be tightly tied over the thigh properly and over the chest.
When the two needles are placed, one on the foot and the other on the head; and when they are adjusted, they should be placed in the middle of the pillow that is placed over the place where the humors are collected, so that the leg does not stick out from under the thighs, because you have to extend it to the parts ahead so that it does not become excited.
And each physician extends to his part, and he should hold the reduction second by the art.
And when the dislocation is in the parts ahead, it is important that the cushion be extended slightly, and it should be placed on this side of the leg according to this method; and the physician should hold the thumb of his hand on the leg, and the other hand on the other part, and the reduction should be stopped at that part.
If the dislocation is in the rear parts, you should not cover that the thigh is extended to the back parts and is raised above the ground; if there are covers that are placed over a hard cause, as if the thigh of the patient is dislocated in the rear parts, according to what has been said about the joint's swelling over two thighs; and if the faces and limbs are extended, according to what has been said, it will not hurt.
If there is an administrated compression on the table over the location where you want to make the joint.
Then when the reduction is completed — and the sign of the reduction is not harmful to you, and it is that you extend from the thigh to the leg, and when you see those knees and the thigh extends the leg's excusation and expands at that excuse, you know that the member follows — and then you adjust the cushions and lift the pressure and extend the bandage so that the thigh is not painful in any of the parts; and adhere the thigh to the legs for three days or four.
And accordingly, remove the ligament and the graft, and compare one chamber with the other.
If you see those gums in your mouth, you know that the dislocation is already fixed, and then take the patient away.
If you see any cause of softening, you return and apply that, and stretch it again the second time, and leave it for three days.
And remove that, and make it walk slowly over the body for several days, until it becomes comfortable.

Of the cure of a dislocation of the nose.
The nose is dislocated in three parts, four in the front, and four in the back, and none in the middle; and it is not dislocated in the lower parts.
And the sign of a dislocation of the nose is that you command the thigh to apply its chamber to the cushion; you know that the nose is dislocated.
When the restoration of all the fingers of the patient is needed, which is to stretch the thighs as much as possible; to adhere the thumb to the face of the patient, and to hold the little finger between the patient's thighs; and to properly adhere the nail of the patient's finger to the palms of your hands, and to retake those between the thighs that the nail of the patient's finger returns to its place.
And if you want to reduce the swelling of the patient, which is that the thigh is held by the cushion that lifts the non-working leg.
And apply that and make the swelling adhere to the thigh, and place those emplacements with a bandage for three days or four, and remove them.
And do not use the thigh muscle for more than a few days, until it is healed and comfortable.
If the reduction of the patient is excused by you, you should administer fort extensive care to the limbs that were in the previous treatment.

Capitulum XXXV.
Of the special types of dislocation that are caused by inflammation, fracture, or some other cause.
When something happens to one of those causes, and you are treating it in the cure of that and in the restoration of the body, you will see visible success in life.
For this translation, I will follow the same format as before, providing a line-by-line translation of the given source sentence into English: When you begin to help the patient, try so hard to reduce the swelling at the beginning of the cause, because it will eventually lead to gout.
If the member returns secondly as you want, administer the medicine that cures gout and treats the inflammation of the swelling caused by cold humors to the patient.
If the dislocation is a fracture and occurs in the separated bones, then perforate the statement of those bones, and do as they have said in the simple diseases of this that precedes in those places.
And keep and avoid secondly that of the intramission in the ways of fear following what I preceded to your preaching; four this is better for you to get from the true Creator, and less permanent for your glory, and less salutations to you those who see you in that time. This is the end of the paragraphs of Albucasim perfectly of the words by which God is not benefited. Amen.
