of hemorrhoids
Hemorrhoids are openings of veins which habitually bleed, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become bluish; and we have already spoken in the division about their nature, and the symptoms, and I will speak here of those that can be treated.
I say that for hemorrhoids and bluish swellings, when they are deep in the anus and they cannot be felt, the treatment is not with iron.
Those that are at the opening of the anus, that can be felt, are those that can be treated.
You must therefore place the woman in a cold room, then pull the swelling with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then powder on blood-stopping medicines, such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things; then have her put her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water; and if bleeding occurs, have her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peel and gallnuts and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice of it on her back.
And if it stops, that's good.
If not, have cupping glasses applied to her back and breasts without incisions; then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or in holly juice with old wine, and apply it warm to the area.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed; and the one that is called "albathir" is red, and looks like a rough head, you must cut it like I said for the swelling; and then treat it until it is healed.
