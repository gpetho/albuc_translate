After I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its completion, and I have reached the end of it, from its expositions and its explanations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Because manual operation is prostrate in our region and in our time completely deprived: until perhaps its science perished, and its trace was cut off: and there remained of it only small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have altered: and error and hesitation have befallen them, until its intentions have been closed, and its force has been removed: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this treatise in it according to the way of position, and explanation, and abbreviation: and that I should come with the forms of the instruments of cautery, and the other instruments of the work: since it is made by the addition of explanation, and by the hastening of that which is necessary.
The reason, however, why a good craftsman with his hands is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be exercised in the science of anatomy before it, which Galen has recounted, until he knows the aids of the members, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their extension, and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their exit.
And on account of that Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We indeed have already spoken of that in the introduction of this book.
Because he who is not knowing what we have said about anatomy is not emptied, but already falls into error, by which men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science, and boast of it without knowledge, and without experience.
Which is because I saw a foolish physician cut an scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he cut certain arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man who was advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Therefore he arrived at it, and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And indeed I had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the sick man, that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a certain Duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture above the wound with cushions and splints with a strong binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he healed him according to his desires.
Afterwards he dismissed him after a few days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and it remained so until his leg and foot became suppurated, and it came to destruction.
Therefore I was called to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and tranquility followed, and he escaped from his pains.
Nevertheless, the corruption was already confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Therefore the corruption ceased to spread in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who perforated a cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated afterwards, until its malignancy was magnified with its master.
That is, because when a cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a member which can tolerate that the whole of it be cut off.
And therefore, O my son, it is necessary for you to know that manual operation is divided into two divisions: namely, operation associated with safety; and operation with which there is danger in most instances. And I have already pointed out in every part of this book where an operation occurs which involves terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to avoid it and leave it alone, so that fools may not find a way to speak and bring dishonor.
Therefore take measurements with care and caution, and treat your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to salvation and laudable success; and leave terrible illnesses of difficult healing; and remove your minds from that which causes you to fear, lest hesitation enter into your faith and your well-being. For it is more conducive to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your reputations.
For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness: lest you be called bad physicians.

Part I.
Concerning the benefit and harm of cautery: and to which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: and if with iron or gold.
Chapter I.
But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its benefits and harms: and in which complexion it should be exhibited.
Therefore I say that the discussion of the quality of the benefit of cautery, and of its harm, is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a science, and a hidden secret.
Many wise men have also spoken on it, and they have disagreed: and indeed a little from their discussions suffices me, fearing prolixity.
Therefore I say that cautery universally benefits every complexion which is with matter and without matter, except for two complexions which are a hot complexion without matter and a dry complexion without matter.
However, in a hot and dry complexion with matter, they disagreed.
For some have said that cautery is beneficial in it.
And others said the contrary, namely that cautery is not suitable in an illness which is from heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry illness be cured with something hot and dry.
And he who says the contrary said: that through cautery benefit is done in every hot and dry illness which happens in the bodies of men; because when you compare the body of man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I indeed say through his speech: because experience has already revealed that to me several times.
However, it is not fitting that he come to it unless he is already proven and practiced in the chapter of cautery exercise lastly, and has known the diversity of the complexions of men, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the space of their time.
From the other complexions however there is no fear for you; and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For now all physicians have agreed on them: and they did not disagree in benefit with cautery in them.
And know, sons, that from the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is this: because fire is simple, whose action does not arrive except to the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined with it, except with little harm.
The action of burning medicines however arrives at that which is distant from the members: and perhaps it causes illness in a member difficult of healing, and perhaps it kills.
Fire however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Now indeed that has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and standing upon the truth of things: and because of that I excuse myself from length of speech.
And know, sons, that they disagree in the time in which it is fitting to perform cautery, and they place the better time in spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times: therefore, because harm happening because of time is submerged in the help which is drawn with cautery.
And especially if cautery is because of pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains which do not tolerate slowness: because it is feared from them that harm which is greater than the small harm entering because of time may happen.
And let not that which the common people and foolish physicians only fear fall into your minds, O sons, namely that that illness which is healed by cautery does not always return: and they posit that as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cautery is nothing but a kind of medicine which alters the complexion, and dries up the humors which are the causes why pains happen.
Nevertheless cautery surpasses medicine in the speed of its healthfulness, and the power of its operation, and the strength of its dominion: and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the complexion of the infirm, and the location of his illness, and its strength: and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it: and that which arrives at it in its acquisition from foods, and similar things from causes, unless the illness in which cautery is administered is done. A subtle illness in a member with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth because of pain, and similar things to it, it is possible therefore that that pain may not return in it.
But that happens in few cases.
But truly the common saying, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is a correct saying: not according to what they intend in it: because they believe that there is no cure which can be combined with medicine, nor with anything else after the application of cautery.
The matter, however, is contrary to that, and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is not so, except that when we administer methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help: then we administer cautery at the end of the matter, and it helps: then from that it follows that cauterium is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
The ancients, however, said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron: and they did not say that, except because of the evenness of gold, and the excellence of its substance: and they said that the place of cautery does not produce pus. That is not true absolutely: because I have now proved it, and I have found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However, when you heat a cautery in the fire made of gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the amount you want, because of the redness of gold: and when it approaches cold, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire, and turns into flakes.
Therefore the craftsman falls into difficulty with it: and because of that, cautery with iron is quicker and more readily available to us, being straighter for the operation.
And I indeed have now ordered this Chapter on Cautery, according to chapters: and I have ordered them from head to foot: so that they may relieve someone seeking what he wants from it. Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization contributes to the control of humidity and coldness in the brain: which two are the cause of headache, and an abundance of the flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and of excessive sleep, and toothache, and sore throat: and universally of every illness which arises from coldness, such as paralysis, headache, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the patient: that he be evacuated first with a cleansing purgative medicine for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, and his age, and his habit.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands squarely, so that he has placed his hands upon his chest.
Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever therefore your middle finger reaches, mark that place with ink. Then heat the olive-shaped cautery; this is its form. Then place it upon the place marked with ink, descending, by which your hand is gradually tightened, and you will turn it.
Then quickly lift your hand and look at the place.
If you see now revealed from the bone the quantity of the head of alkiel, or the quantity of zeuherbi, then lift your hand.
And if not, repeat with your hand the same iron, or with another if it cools, until you see the bones which I told you about.
Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and soak the cautery in it, and place it on the place; and leave it for three days.
Then place on it the cautery soaked in butter, and leave it on the place until the fire eschar is destroyed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment until it heals.
They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits; wherefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Then scrape away what has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the very end with the cautery, until it makes a strong impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, which is done like the shape of a kirate: or an instrument which women put on infused small letters: and they think that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it is consolidated.
But to me these two kinds of cautery do not seem at all suitable except in certain men, according to the way of fear.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better for his health.
For the head is weakened by the breaking of its natural continuity, as we have testified in other members; and especially when the head of the sick person is naturally weak.  And indeed the first kind of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore work with it safely.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head, and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses bloodlettings, and cuppings, and purgatives for the head, and oils, and cataplasms.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and none of those things benefits him: then consider.
For if the patient's head is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery a little below it.
Then cauterize it above every horn of his head with a cautery, until the skin is pierced, and a quantity of bone, which we have described, is uncovered.
And cauterize him with one cautery in the occiput of his head, in the place which is called a vessel: and it is the place where a cupping glass is placed: and raise your instrument in this, and do not uncover the bone.
For the patient finds a very intense pain because of that, and different from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
And I shall call this cautery in its place: and it is necessary that it be a cautery, with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its occiput with a finer cautery, than that with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
And this is its form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with a caustic medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with cleansing medicines, and the remaining treatment which I have described in the divisions of illnesses is administered, and it does not altogether help: then cauterization is indicated in it according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine: or with iron. Cauterization with a sharp burning medicine is as follows: take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends on both sides.
Then incise the painful area at the time with a broad phlebotomy knife, until a space is made under the skin, into which the clove is inserted.
Then insert it under the skin until it is hidden; then bind over it with a suitable compress, and leave it for fifteen hours; then unbind it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; afterwards apply a cloth soaked in butter to it, until the area produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish to do it with certain burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterization with iron, however, is in this manner.
A fire cautery, whose form is this.
And it is called a nail, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is a certain curve, and in the middle of it there is a small projection.
Then place it on the spot, and hold your hand: and you slowly revolve the iron quickly: and let the quantity which is burned be of the thickness of the skin, like half of it.
And raise your hand, so that the artery which is below is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak a pledget in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days: then place a pledget with butter: afterwards treat with ointment until it is healed. And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second knife-like end of the cautery.
And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly an old one.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in an old hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When you treat a hemicrania with what we have said from the preceding treatment, and what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that what we said about the first cautery with medicine, or with fire cautery, is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat a knife-like cautery until it becomes white after you mark on the place of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or about that: and place your hand at once, and press it until you cut the artery, and reach the bone. However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves in mastication, lest the side be burned, or the nerve which moves it, whence a spasm may result.
And be watchful and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut.
For in its incision there is danger, and especially to him who is ignorant of what he does, and is not studious, nor experienced: and he leaves the operation with that in the first instance.
And I will come with a recollection of the regime of the flow of blood happening from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
But if you see from the sickness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives.
For cauterization is better than this and more helpful. Concerning the manner of cauterizing in earache.
Chapter VI. When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and it is treated with resolvents and the other treatment which we described in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and it is that which is called a point, whose form is this.
Then prick with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it is rolled around; or around each, if the pain is in both at the same time.
And move the cautery away from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with a hot iron: and let the quantity of cautery be ten points in each ear, and about that much.
Then treat the places until they heal.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in torticollis.
Chapter VII.
Torticollis which is cured with cauterization is only from the types which happen from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses. And avoid cauterization of the type which happens from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you treat this type of torticollis with bleedings, and purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the afflicted person with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little below the temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part.
Because softening does not happen except in the part which appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the end of the upper ear under the horn of the head a little: and another in the temple: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
And place your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, whose form is described above: however, it is not a little thinner than that, as you see: and it is necessary that there be a knife in it of slightly superfluous thickness. Then take care of the place, with what preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When apoplexy becomes chronic, and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cautery in the occiput of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of cauterization should be according to what preceded.
Also, cauterization is done with a cautery over the stomach; and this is more of a last resort.
Then let him be treated with what preceded.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in oblivion.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that in the beginning, great hyera and pills purifying the brain be given to the patient to drink.
Then shave the patient's entire head, and place upon his occiput the mustard plaster described in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times. For this is the method of cauterization; and do it according to the same order which I described there. If therefore he is healed by it, it is good.
If not, then make for him three cauterizations in the posterior part of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and place between each cauterization the width of a finger.
Then treat the cauterizations with what preceded.
But if you wish an addition, and the patient is able to tolerate it, then make for him a cauterization in the middle.
But if you wish an addition, then cauterize it above the two horns.
Then treat it until it is healed; and let the cauterization be anointed according to the form which was previously mentioned.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with syringes, and with that which we have said.
Then shave the head of the patient; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery above each horn of the head, and with a cautery behind it, and with three above the vertebrae of the neck.
But if in the illness you need a softening of the body with more of those things, and the patient is tolerant, and the illness is severe: then cauterize him with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and lastly with a cautery, until very much of his skin is burned, and raise your hand.
Then treat him until he is healed: and thus cauterize with olive oil.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized unless his epilepsy is from phlegm. Therefore it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with herbs, and with the other treatment which we have described in the division, when the patient is strong, or is tolerant in receiving medicines.
But if he is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and masticatories cleansing the brain are administered beforehand for many days, with improvement of diet.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, as preceded in the manner: and with another cautery in the occiput, and above every horn of his head with a cautery.
But if the patient is strong and is tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned in the case of one having paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the manner which preceded. But if the patient is a child, then apply a fine cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterization in melancholia.
Chapter XII.
When the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we mentioned in the case of one having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined toward melancholia, and the body of the infirm is moist, then give him something to drink which will cleanse his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the head of the infirm, and afterwards make a properly made bandage of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head; and the infirm person sitting upright should be held on every side.
Then present the liniment. And it is more worthy from old sheep's butter.
And heat it over a fire with a moderate measured heat, which a finger can tolerate when put into it.
Then empty it onto the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this for the patient once every week, along with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it making very many small points of it, except that you hold your hand with the cautery: indeed, it should be by smelling.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with a quality.
Then place on it a piece of cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of water in the eye is shown to you by the signs which I mentioned in the division, then begin and purge the patient with that which cleanses his head.
And keep him from all dampness, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him on the two temples with two cauteries, if the beginning of the descent of water is in both eyes at once; or on one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye: and cut off with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in the width of the temples: and beware of a flow of blood.
But if you see something of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting off of them, and caution from the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries ultimately produced.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in old tears.
Chapter XIV.
When the tears of the eyes are old, constant: and are upon the veins, and arteries which are in the manifest head externally, it is verified that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with the same cautery that I narrated in the beginning of descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries upon the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck under the two bones.
And if you need addition, then cauterize it on every side carefully of the eye, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in nasal stench.
Chapter XV.
When you treat it with what we said in the division, and the medication does not help: then hasten, and give the patient  infirmocochias to drink for three nights: then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery.
Then cauterize it with a nail-shaped cautery, with two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
And beware of the artery, lest you injure it.
And this is the shape of the nail-shaped cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in each part; and let them be far from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not move your hand with the cautery too much, but according to the amount that burns a third of the eyelid.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of lunar cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are inverted, pricking the eye. Chapter XVII.
Cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.
In cauterization with fire, however, instruct the patient beforehand to remove his hairs, if he is one of those who cleanse them, until they are lengthened and made even. But if they prick him at their root: then bind his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they grow.
When therefore they have grown and are even, then place the patient's head in your bosom; then mark upon the eyelid of his eyes with a cautery, a mark which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a pledget soaked in egg white or in flaxseed mucilage upon the eye.
Then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Then cauterize over the mark which you have made, little by little in many times, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is completely burned in its proper appearance.
And a sign of the health of your work is: if you see the eyelid of the eye now contract, and the hairs rise up at the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days.
Then place a pledget with butter on it, until the eschar is removed.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some of the hairs return after a time, and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that place, as you did at first.
But if the hairs are below, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is level so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
It is to instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even.
Make from paper or cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take of known soap and of unslaked lime, one ounce of each or thereabouts; then grind them together well and do it quickly so that it does not get cold.
Then spread some of it on the paper which you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or both eyelids.
And place under the eye a piece of linen soaked in egg white; and let the patient's head be in your bosom.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently.
And you should move it whenever the patient feels the bite of the medicine; for its bite is found to be like fire.
While therefore the biting sensation persists, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When therefore the biting sensation ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if you see the eyelid rise, as it rises with contraction from fire, or with incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat the application of the medicine to the place where the medicine does not imprint and does not blacken, until your operation is equal, and the eye is contracted.
Then place a compress with butter on it, until the burnt skin is removed.
Then treat it with diaphnicum ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you during the operation to observe the utmost care, lest anything of the medicine fall into the eye.
But if the eyelid softens afterwards, and something fights from the hairs in the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and smallness.
Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the way of rectitude is not hidden from him who studies this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a lacrimal fistula.
Chapter XIX.
When you treat a fistula, with what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your bosom, and let a servant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it is not moved or shaken.
Then place a cotton pledget infused in egg white or in flaxseed mucilage over his eye; then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's quill from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to be penetrating to the other end, and if you wish it to be raised up, try it thus.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
And hold your hand with it a little near the cautery from the eye, towards the side of the nose, so that your hand does not err, or the patient is disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
If therefore you reach with the beginning of your cautery as far as the bone, it will be well.
And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Then apply a pledget with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it is healed. But if forty days have passed, and it is not healed, then put on it a sharp corrosive medicine, until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which certain early practitioners mentioned.
Direct yourself to the place of the fistula, and incise it; then place in the incision a fine tube, that is, a thin cannula, of which this is the shape.
And pour into it the quantity of a drachm of melted lead, and hold your hand with good retention of the cannula, and let the patient not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run, or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the eye of the sick person a compress soaked in egg white or in water.
For the lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous healing.
If the fistula is healed with that which we have said, by cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to manage the opening of the nose, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to that which will come in its own proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing fissures of the lips.
Chapter 20.
Very often fissures occur on the lip, which are called chaps, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, with what we said in the division of illnesses, and the treatment does not help, then prepare a small cautery iron, according to this form.
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then treat it with cerate, until it heals.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula of the mouth.
Chapter XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus, and breaks; afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms: then you treat it, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to apply a heated cautery according to the size it occupies in the fistula.
Then insert the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and its end; do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterwards with what we have said concerning treatment until it is cured.
If then the pus is cut away and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place, and remove the corrupt bone according to what will come into its head.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the gums and softened teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum is softened because of humors, and the teeth are moved, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the patient's head in your bosom.
Then a fire cautery, whose form will come after these things, so that you place a cannula on the tooth: and quickly introduce the ignited cautery into it: and hold your hand a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth.
And lift your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to what you wish.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
For the moved tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt humor is dried.
Chapter XXIII.
When the toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or a worm in it, and treatment with medicines does not help: then cauterization is done in it in two ways: either cauterization with butter or cauterization with fire.
Now cauterization with butter is as follows: take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a pan.
Then take a wisp of cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe.
Then dip it in the boiling butter and quickly apply it to the aching tooth, and hold it there until it cools; then repeat this several times until the effect of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and apply it to the aching tooth; then place a heated iron on top of it until the heat penetrates to the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterization with fire, however, is done by using a bronze tube or an iron tube. And let there be something in the body of the tube of sufficient thickness so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery, whatever its shape may be, and apply it to that tooth, and hold your hand there until the cautery cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either on that same day or on another.
And it is necessary, in the impression of that cautery, that the patient fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, as is possible; and this is the shape of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in strumae.
Chapter 24.
When strumae are from phlegm and from cold humors, and are not amenable to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them quickly: then a concave cautery of fire, whose shape is this.
Having two open ends, so that smoke may exit from the cautery at the other end: and place it ignited upon the abscess once, and a second time if you need it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
But if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and apply a poultice infused in butter, until what the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth unguent until the fistula is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in hoarseness of voice, and constriction of breath.
Chapter XXV.
When humors overcome the lung canal, and especially when it is with coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated first with solutive medicines.
Then cauterize it in the uvula at the root of the throat in a depressed place; and beware lest you reach with the cautery to the throat, nor into the skin, except a little of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the juncture of the neck in the last vertebra thereof, to the end; and let the cautery be nail-shaped according to the manner which preceded.
Then treat it with that which preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the sicknesses of the lung and cough.
Chapter XXVI.
When cough and sickness of the lung are from cold humors, and the infirm person has neither fever nor consumption, and the sickness is of long standing: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in places depressed, soft, and empty.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be a cannula according to the form which preceded.
And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, which is called a Point, the form of which preceded in the puncturing of earache: and let the points be from thirty points up to about others.
Then treat him with that which preceded, until he is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Therefore the cauterization is alleviated with it, when you do with it at one time three cauterizations.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the Titillicus, in the dislocation of the Humerus.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head is dislocated by reason of humors, and is not fixed in the hour of its return from its dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to return, then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you reduce the dislocation first.
Then the patient is laid on his back, or on his healthy side.
Then raise the skin which is in the inner Titillicus upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then have a cautery with two prongs. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, wherefore the figure of the cauterization then becomes six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the probe.
And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added to this manner, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Then place over the cautery crushed leeks with salt.
Then make the patient adhere to stillness, so that the member is not moved for some time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is towards the upper parts, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a nail-shaped cautery, or with many cauteries puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach, until they draw it away from its complexion, and catarrhs are multiplied to it, and frequent methods of cure do not help: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back, and extend his legs and his hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the breastbone the size of one finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on the two sides of the one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
And lengthen the distance between each so that they do not join, when they produce pus. And let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery with which this cauterization is done be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for one who is frightened by this cautery: and it is so that you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity which you wish with a cautery; then cauterize it with a pointed cautery; then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter XXIX.
When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and dampness, or from gross flatulence, until it departs from its natural complexion by superfluous departure, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the patient be laid supine upon his neck, and you mark with a cautery three cauterizations according to this figure, and this same quantity upon the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the elbow of a man reaches: and let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of a straight body: and do not press your hand with the cautery very much.
And let the quantity of that which is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, a quantity of half of it not added: and let the patient be standing on his feet.
But if he is not standing, then let him be lying, who now extends his legs and raises his arms. This is the form of the cautery.
And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize these cauterizations with a knife-cautery, when you have skill and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed excessively in cauterization, and burn the whole thickness of the skin, wherefore the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
Concerning the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
Chapter 30.
When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person experiences pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is intense sharp pain; and you see now that its treatment has fatigued the physicians.
Therefore, it is necessary that the sick person lie on his back.
Then mark the location of the abscess with a cautery; then heat a cautery that resembles a ray.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with it one cautery, until the whole skin is burned, and it reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out: then treat it with the treatment of exits, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary to use this type of cautery, except by one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hands these illnesses occur with experience several times: then indeed let him dare to perform this kind of operation.
But truly, to leave it alone is better for me.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Pleurisy.
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said, cautery with the roots of aristolochia for cold pleurisy in this manner.
And it is, that you take of the dried roots of aristolochia, one longer root, which is found among them, and let it be like the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil: and ignite it in the fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the clavicle with the neck, and with two small cauteries somewhat sloping below the chin towards the part which is under the chin.
And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib sloping slightly towards the back: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And with three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades: and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, lower than the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the cautery, rather let it be evident on the skin by smelling. And now some ancients have said that there are some men who use a cautery of iron similar to a ray: and they ignite it, and internally send it into that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess with it, and pus comes out: as we said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no healing.
Chapter XXXII. On the method of cauterizing the spleen.
When you treat a splenic illness, with what we have said of treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then cauterization is indicated in three ways, all of which are correct.
One of which is to make three or four cauteries, arranging them lengthwise along the spleen, following the shape of the liver cauteries, the shape of which has preceded.
And let there be between each cautery the amount of a finger's breadth, or a little more or less.
And let the method of cauterization be as we have described for the liver cauterization.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the patient lie on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: to heat a cautery having two prongs, as we described in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus; and lift the skin which is directly over the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches; and let your lifting of the skin be according to the breadth of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them; then withdraw the cautery: thus four cauteries are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then take care of the cautery after you release it, that it discharges pus for many days; for it is more beneficial than any of the preceding treatments.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Chapter XXXIII.
Cautery does not fall in dropsy, except for ascites specifically.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment which we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery above the stomach, and another cautery above the liver, and a cautery above the spleen, and two cauteries on the back between the vertebrae, and one in the region of the chest, and another in the region of the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be approximately the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment after cauterization with it: for it is necessary that two intentions be combined for him: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
However, the shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped: according to what preceded regarding its shape: and that with which the back is cauterized, should be olive-shaped according to what preceded regarding its shape.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs. Chapter 34.
When abscesses occur in a dropsical patient and are filled with yellowish water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the dorsum of the foot in the hollow which is between the little finger and the ring finger: and raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
For yellowish water will sweat out, and let the cautery be according to this shape.
Then make two cauteries on each of the two legs, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another lower than that, about the middle of the leg: and on each thigh two cauteries: and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time: so that some water sweats out from it: then treat it with the other things which we have said.
Concerning the method of cauterization in looseness of the bowels. Chapter 35.
When there is looseness of the bowels from cold and humors, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is treated with methods of treatment, and is not healed: and you see the patient tolerating cauterization of exuberant virtue, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, as preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a thin nail-like cautery: and a large cautery over the ileum above the ileocecal valve, or two cauteries.
And if you see exuberant humors, and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery over the pubis, and a cautery over each ilium: and perhaps you will add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted humors, and they are treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries above the lower vertebra of the back slightly below the navel in a somewhat triangular fashion, and with a cautery below the navel as if by two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming inflamed, then cauterize him above the stomach with a large cautery, according to what has preceded: and cauterize above his liver, and another above his spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him, until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you cut away althelul, then heat a cautery which resembles a ray.
Then insert it, burning, into the excised althelul: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once, or twice. If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have related.
Then treat them with what benefits them of ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more ultimate in aid.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter XXXVIII.
When the patient does not obey the incision and the operation which we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is healed with a cautery.
Therefore, when a fistula happens to someone, and it becomes old, pus and corrupt humors flow from it.
Therefore, what is more fitting is that you probe it with a slender probe.
Then learn the quantity of its depth with a probe.
Then heat a cautery, which is similar to a ray.
Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula and the amount that the nail entered. And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the amount of your necessity.
And guard yourself from burning a nerve, if it is there, or a large vein; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
And do not do this except when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Then treat the place until it heals.
But if the place is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time: then know that it is now completely healed.
And if materials are not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupted bone is in its depth, or something like that from those: the recollection of which will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Chapter 39.
When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from thick wind, and the strength of the sick person is diminished because of it, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the almethen above the kidneys themselves, with a cautery on each kidney with a nail-shaped cautery, the mention of which has preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the almeidatu itself.
Therefore three lines will result.
Therefore the last ones will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Chapter 40. When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and humidity, until the patient does not retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the pubis above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, and with a cautery on the right side of the pubis, and another on the left: and let the length of that lateral cauterization be according to the size of a thumb joint: and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or with two cauteries, if you need it: and let it be according to what preceded, a nail-shaped cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb. Chapter 41.
When cold and humidity occur in the womb, and it is prevented by that from impregnation, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs to her at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the pubis in the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Chapter 42.
When mucous humors are poured out to the socket of the hip, and they become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of that is that the leg is lengthened over the other, when they are compared together: and the place of dislocation is found in it empty.
Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the patient above the socket of his hip with a cautery similar to a circle: after you mark with a cautery around the socket, as it is revolved: and that the socket itself fall in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form which preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
But if this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of the whole skin.
Then care for him, until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in sciatica. Chapter 43.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its causes are cold and humors, and the patient is treated with what we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of thick humors with foul-smelling pills, or with artificial pills, and the like.
Then cauterize him.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is, that you cauterize above the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them a good, or bad, depth.
And let the space which is between each cautery be the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes, however, a cautery is made in the middle above the head of the hip joint itself.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, the form of which preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, with one: so that it is a circle containing the whole hip.
And burn the thickness of the whole skin.
This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and is not extended to the thigh and leg.
But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the thigh, above the place to which the sick person points there, in which there is pain, and with your cautery above the calf four fingers towards the outside slightly: and let the cautery be knife-shaped. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
But if the sick person indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a pointed cautery, three, or four, or more, if he needs it.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-shaped cautery.
And beware in all your cauterization, that you do not go so far with the cautery as to burn a nerve, or a large artery, and draw upon the sick person through that a great harm, or contraction.
And indeed I have seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in cauterization, and the leg swelled, until the swelling reached the foot, and it was completely perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then there followed a looseness of the bowels, and death after that.
If the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each according to this method.
And certain wise men have said concerning the cauterization of the hip, of which this is the method.
Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date stone, or somewhat less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space which is between each cautery be the size of a thumb joint: and let the cauteries be open on two sides: and let their height be about a joint, or two joints: and make for them a handle of iron decently fitted to the cauteries.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed upon the hip joint, the patient lying on his sound side.
Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at one time.
Then leave him for three days.
Afterwards, apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis says, "My son, we have used this type of cautery little, because of the terror of its appearance: and therefore, because we have found few who would endure it.
Nevertheless, it is one of the good cauteries for him who endures it, and finds its proper place.
Now, a cautery with burning medicines is made as follows: you make two plates having a perforated ring into which descends a hinge of its door, of bronze or iron, the length of the wall; at the height of which are two nodes, or something like them.
And let the space which is between both be the size of the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let them contain each other, according to this form.
Then place it over the hip socket, the patient lying on his healthy side.
And press your hand very much upon the hip socket.
Then pour between the two circles some warm water, which has been slightly heated with fire, and hold it for the space of an hour: and let the patient endure its biting and burning, for he will find the biting like fire, until the biting ceases.
Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the whole hip with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
And put butter on it until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for some days, and pus will flow from it.
For it is ultimately helpful.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the pain extends to the hip or leg: make him stand in what contains water, according to what you did to the hip equally.
And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Take alkali and quicklime, one part of each; grind both, and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which is perforated with one small hole, according to the size that the ray enters it; and place under the bottom of the pot another glass pot; and pour over the alkali and lime fresh water, which submerges both by a finger; after which you compress them with your hand with good pressure; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over more lime; and filter until it is renewed.
For then it will be very strong in sharpness, which is used in many medical operations, and in cauterizing other members.
Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
And among medicines are those with which ankles are cauterized, also such as tesisie, and cashew nut honey, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
And Galen indeed, in narrating, recounted the cure of a certain man from antiquity, by which he was cured of pain in the hip and sciatic vein; and he magnified it to be very great.
And he said that he did not need another cure, and that he was healed from one application, until he recounted that he perhaps entered the bath carried, and came out of it already healed. And it is that it is taken from green setaragi; and if green is not found, let dry, fresh [setaragi] be taken; and let it be ground very much with a little fat, and let it be placed on the hip, where there is pain, or leg, or in the thigh; and let it be bound, and let it be left for the quantity of three hours, or for the amount that the infirm person feels a lessening of the burning.
Then put him in the bath.
When therefore his body becomes moist, introduce him into the bath.
For the pain recedes, and it heals.
And know that it is not fitting that anyone use a cautery with these medicines, except after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides also said that goat dung, when the sciatic vein is cauterized with it, benefits it: and the cautery is done in this way.
Let wool be taken, and let it be soaked in old oil, and let it be placed upon the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle bone, and is closer to the ankle bone.
Then take dry goat dung, and burn it in the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Then repeat it.
Therefore do not cease doing this, until feeling reaches the middle as far as the ankle, and the pain ceases.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccine cautery.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Chapter 44.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from superfluous evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter: and cautery indeed does not apply except in this single type, which occurs from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuating the patient with foul-smelling pills and the like, three lines should be made on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the patient's back, after marking with cautery in each line five cauterizations, or more according to the quantity that comes from the patient's tolerance and strength: and let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries, or four, with a nail-shaped cautery in the middle, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the beginning of humpback.
Chapter XLV.
This illness often happens to small infants.
And a sign of its beginning in children is that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you find in the last vertebra of the back and its knots that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see this and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery which is circular according to this form.
And let the cautery take hold of every part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, [make] two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware lest you apply the cautery to a hump which is caused by a spasm of the nerve.
Concerning the method of cauterizing gout and the pains of the joints. Chapter 46.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors which are poured out into any member of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to name this properly gout.
Therefore, when gout of cold cause is treated with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
And it is so that he cauterizes it after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Whose form is this.
And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
But if the pains ascend to the knees, or the other joints, and this happens many times, then cauterize it above each knee with three cauteries, or four on each side, with this same clavus cautery. If however more are necessary with this cautery, then cauterize it. And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
But if the pains ascend to the knees and the back: then administer what we said of the cautery in its chapter.
But if the pains are in the hands only, then puncture around the wrists, as two lines are drawn around.
But if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, above each knot a puncture, and above the ridge of the hand.
But if the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not deprive the patient of good regimen, of the reception of medicines.
For if good regimen is done, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with God's help with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
Chapter 47.
When a rupture occurs in the groins, and the intestine or scrotum descends to the testicle, and it is beginning and nearby: then it is necessary that you order the patient to omit eating on his day.
And that he use lenitives, so that stool descends from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath, until the scrotum or intestine emerges or appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a cautery under the rupture above the pubic bone, with a mark whose end is similar to half a circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, whose form is this, until it becomes white, and throws off sparks.
Then return the intestine or scrotum to its cavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand on the place, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have now opened between the legs of the patient, and placed a cushion under him, and another servant upon his legs, and another upon his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery upon that mark, your hand with the cautery standing straight.
And hold it until you reach the bone with it: or repeat with it another time, if you have not reached the bone with it in the first attempt.
And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and there befall the patient from it either death or great harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be thin, according to their size.
Then treat with the other ointments, until it is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment for the length of time of his treatment, which softens his bowels: so that the intestine does not come out during straining and evacuation.
Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage, and let him keep it on for another forty days.
For when he uses this regime, thus he is healed with a complete healing.
But when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize his rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be then as one third of it.
Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not increase.
And now some ancients have said: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with a hot iron, and a line is placed which is across the upper side of the rupture, and another line below. And place your hand in the middle with a nail-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better. Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When pain occurs in some members from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help it, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of every member be according to its size, and its suitability, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
If therefore it heals from the first cauterization, it is well.
If not, then repeat the cauterization on it.
Because it is customary for these pains to move from one member to that which is near it.
Therefore it is necessary that you pursue them with cautery, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Chapter 49.
Lepers, however, are sometimes greatly helped by cautery.
And especially the type of leprosy which arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore when you wish to cauterize it, consider.
If therefore the leprosy is incipient, and you have treated it with what we have described in the division, and it neither subsides nor remains static: and you fear for the patient, that corruption may spread throughout his whole constitution: then cauterize him upon the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, noticeably, and a second below it towards the forehead at the hairline, and two upon the two temples, and one behind upon the nape of the neck.
And lastly, apply your hand with the cautery lightly, until it imprints a small mark upon the surface, and the crusts are detached from it: so that the exhalation of thick vapours from it may be relieved, and cauterize also with a cautery upon the spleen itself, as has been previously described.
But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient, and is manifestly apparent: then it is necessary that you cauterize with those cauteries which we have described on the head, and with a cautery upon the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries upon the two cheeks, and with two cauteries upon the cervical vertebrae, and six upon the dorsal vertebrae, and one large one upon the al-hahos at the base of the spine and one above it, in the al-meidati: and two upon the hips: namely one upon each hip, and two upon the knees: one upon each knee, and two upon the shoulders, and two upon the elbows, and two upon the tenderness of his chest: and cauterize him upon every joint, of the joints of his fingers and toes: and cauterize upon every heel of his feet, and the wrists of his hands.
And beware of the nerves which are upon the back of the heel, lest you burn them. And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery upon the pubic bone, and another upon the stomach, and another upon the liver.
And know that the more cauterization you add, the more helpful and beneficial it is.
And know that the patient does not find pain in cauterization as the healthy do, because his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be of size and smallness according to the limbs and joints, as preceded in the kinds of instruments.
Chapter L.
When a limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to what the size or smallness of the limb merits.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin slightly.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes cauterization is done for some numbness which happens in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Truly, let no one presume upon this unless he is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Albaras.
Chapter 51.
When Albaras becomes chronic and nothing of the medical arts benefits it, then cauterize over it with a deep cautery a little, according to the amount of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Then treat it with the flour of the herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood: of each let there be one part; let all these be mixed, and spread upon a cloth, and applied to the place, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Cancer.
Chapter 52.
When the cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it is rolled.
The wise men, however, said that it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the middle.
But to me that does not seem good, because I fear that it will ulcerate; and I have already seen that several times. And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries. Concerning the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Chapter LIII.
When someone has an abscess, and it is slow in maturing, either because of the abundance causing it, or because of the age of the patient, when he is weak and has little blood, or because of the time, and one wishes to hasten the maturation of the abscess, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it itself will hasten with maturation.
But if you wish its perforation with a cautery, then a fire cautery, whose form is this.
And place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the patient, so that the flow of pus may be relieved.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corroding ulcer. Chapter 54.
A corroding ulcer is nothing but a corruption in a limb that spreads, and corrodes it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore if you see a corroding ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then have many fire cauteries, small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place in which the corroding ulcer is.
Then cauterize it from every part until you eradicate the whole corruption, and nothing at all remains of it. Then leave it for three days, and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas, until all the eschars and all the corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Therefore if you see that after three days flesh grows in a healthy way, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And a corrosive is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine.
For it arises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker benefit: and indeed I have already spoken of its cauterization with a sharp medicine in the division: therefore accept it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in nails and warts. Chapter 55.
Often this ailment happens in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered thing, which harms the foot. And indeed cautery in them is according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for that with fire, make a concave fire cautery similar to a vulture's feather: which is made of iron, according to the size that contains the nail on every side: and let it have thin edges.
Then place it, ignited, upon the nail. Then roll the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus. Then plaster it with wild mallows, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on it at night. For it itself will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the place with a flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
But if they are not converted, and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply a cautery to them with warm water: and it is so that you take a small tube of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather: and place it over the nail, or the wart.
Then pour a small quantity of warm water into the tube: hold your hand, and you revolve it with the compression of your hand a little, so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the nail, and the warm water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait a little for the biting of the warm water for one hour.
Then dismiss him, for the nail will be eradicated with its roots.
Do this with them one after another, until you come to all of them that are in the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Tremor.
Chapter 56.
When tremor happens to someone from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five, over the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra a cautery, and on his chest a cautery, and over his stomach a cautery.
For tremor rests with the olive cautery, and the healing of the cold illness hastens. Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter 57.
Sometimes foul things are expelled in the body, that is, pustules which are made from corrupted gross materials.
Therefore it is necessary that when they appear, they be cauterized above the whole head of the pustule with a fine cautery with myrtle wood, the end of which is lit with fire.
Or with the root of long birthwort.
Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized immediately at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner: and they do not increase; and the superfluity making them is broken, and they are healed.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Chapter LVIII. Very often there occurs a flow of blood from an artery which has been cut in a wound, which happens externally, or in the incision of an abscess, or the cauterization of a limb, and things similar to them: and it is difficult to stop it.
Therefore when this happens to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it: and press it hard, until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing escapes from it. Then put into the fire small olive-oil cauteries, and a large number of larger ones: and blow upon them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place in which the artery is broken, and place the cautery upon the vein, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
But if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries which are prepared in the fire. Therefore do not cease doing this with one after another, until the blood is stopped.
And beware lest you burn the nerve which is there, and some other harm befall the patient. And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods.
Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the bleeding is stopped.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the bleeding is stopped. Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Or medicines with the property of stanching blood are placed upon it, and it is bound with a suitable constricting bandage.
But he who administers its excision with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or the application of cauterizing agents, and the like, does not completely benefit him, except rarely.
But if this should happen to someone, and a physician or medicine is not present: then he should begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have described, and constricting it strongly, until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
And the finger should not be removed, pouring cold water of intense coldness over it constantly, until the blood is congealed and thickened, and is cut off. And meanwhile he should consider what he needs from cautery or medicine.
The End of the First Part.
Book of Surgery of Albucasis, Part II. Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds and similar things.
We have already said in the first chapter, every illness in which cautery with fire and burning medicine is suitable, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries. And I placed chapters there from the head to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that the seeker may be relieved of his seeking. And before I begin that, it is necessary that you learn, O sons, that in this chapter is from the terror that which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And on account of that, it is necessary that caution be greater in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood often falls, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of an exit, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and things like these: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death falls upon many of them.
And I warn you, lest that fall upon you in which there is hesitation, for sometimes there fall to you in this art kinds of men with kinds of infirmities.
For among them is he who is angered by his illness, and death is light to him: because of the vehemence of that which he finds from his illness and the length of its malice.
And with illness is fear which signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his silence, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is pernicious. Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be stronger than your greed and your rapacity.
And do not presume about anything of it, except after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which a laudable outcome has arrived.
And use in the treatment of all your infirm, prognosis and indication of that to which health is fittingly suited.
For in that is help for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, O sons, with His understanding, and may He not take away from you direction and inspiration: because that is in His hand.
And I indeed have arranged this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: that the thing which you wish from it, and which you need, may be lightened for you.
Concerning the treatment of water which gathers in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this infirmity very often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife constricts the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
And indeed I have not seen this illness in others than in children; and death hastened to all whom I saw of them: therefore it seemed to me to leave the operation in it.
And indeed I saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until he could not sit upright because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture indeed, is either collected between the skin and the bone, or is collected under the bone upon the dura mater.
And the operation in that, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with one cut in width; and let the length of the incision be about two finger-widths, until the moisture flows out.
And this is the shape of a spatula.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions, according to this shape.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side: and the water is depressed when you compress it with your hand inwards, and that is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions, according to this manner.
And after the incision remove all the moisture.
Then moisten it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then unbind the ligature, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound with equal pressure.
And feed the patient with all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes it is greater in the occiput, or in the sinciput, or on the right, or on the left.
Therefore, proceed with the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear to you: and incise it as much as is possible for you.
And observe that you do not cut an artery, and that a flow of blood occurs, and that the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of the moisture.
Concerning the incision of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When catarrhs happen to someone in the eyes or in the chest, and it becomes chronic, and the treatment of medicines does not help: then, in that case, the last resort is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, it is necessary that the patient shave his head.
Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Then let the patient bind his neck with any cloth of his.
Then consider where the vein pulsates.
And the locations of both are the depressed places which are behind the ears: and rarely is it hidden, except in certain men.
Then mark with a cautery over both; and incise both with a sharp spatula on each side, the incision reaching to the bone; and let this be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, introduce the spatula under the artery, and incise it upwards with an incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
For when a vein is incised, blood flows out with a pulsatile flow, which leaps inwards with a frequent leap.
But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers.
Then mark with a cautery, and cut to the bone.
And that which it is necessary to let out of blood, is six ounces and perhaps you let out of it more, or less. All that according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the infirm and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound.
Then if something of the sifac remains at the bone, then incise it, lest a hot abscess occur: then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from chronic headache, or acute catarrh due to acrid humors and heat in the temples, or chronic, severe headache and similar ailments, and he is treated with medical remedies and they do not help: then we have found in these illnesses that extraction of the arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have related, to be effective.
And the method of operating in their extraction is that the patient should shave the hairs which are in the temples, and locate the artery appearing in the temple.
For it is shown to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few men, or by the intensity of cold.
But if it is hidden from you, then let the patient bind his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Or steam the place with warm water until it appears to you manifestly. Then take the spatula which I described a little while ago. Then scrape the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Then throw a hook into it, and draw it upwards until you pull it out of the skin, and make it emerge from the tunics which are beneath it on every side.
But if the artery is small, then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Then cut from it a part according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and that a flow of blood does not occur.
For if it is not cut, and if it is not cut off, the blood does not completely rise. Then evacuate blood from six ounces down to three.
But if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with double thread, strong, of silk or of alhod cords, so that putrefaction does not rush to it before the healing of the wound, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures.
Do this at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone, with a knife-cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in the place of the same work.
And it is a better procedure, unless the patient has a fever or is of a hot complexion.
Because cautery is among those things which help to end humidities.
Therefore it is a better help.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that the place be filled with old cotton; and that small cushions properly made be placed upon it.
And after loosening it should be treated with dry medicines which cause flesh to grow, and with linen cloths, until it is healed.
But if meanwhile, while you are operating, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with zegi: and bind your hand until the blood is cut off.
But if none of these things is present to you, then place your finger on the place until the blood congeals.
And bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness ceases, and bind it as is necessary.
And of that which is lighter and easier in the extraction of an artery, is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to an almond.
However, they are of much less sharpness than two knives.
Because if they are sharp, like two knives, the cold hastens to both: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this, therefore, the work is better than all work, and lighter, and easier.
And let the space that is between the two knives be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with a cautery: and place both very hot, until they arrive at the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that that which is between its extremities is lengthened.
For they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Concerning the care of sharp, constant, watery discharge from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When there are constant tears, and their flow is from the veins which are on the outside of the skull, and nothing of medical treatment helps with medicines, and you see the face of the sick person already reddened, and he feels a crawling on his forehead, like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are thinned, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded with corrosion, and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients needed in their treatment this operation, and they named it treatment with the Knife.
And it is, that you should order the sick person to shave the hairs which are on his forehead.
Then incise three equidistant fissures on the forehead according to the length of the forehead; and let the length of the fissure be about two fingers, and one fissure be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length somewhat from the movement of the muscles, and the third from the other side; and beware of cutting the arteries which are on the two sides; and lengthen your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of each incision be the quantity of three joined fingers; and let you have a prepared piece of sponge, or many dried cloths, with which you dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, whose form follows now.
From the incision which is from the side of the temples, up to the second incision: and flay with it all the skin which is between the two incisions, with the aponeurosis which is on the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Then remove this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp scalpel, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh connected with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, clean the places of the clots of congealed blood. Then put into each fissure a pledget of old linen, and place over them little pillows soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar.
And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, untie the ligature, and administer a plentiful infusion with warm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment and other remedies with which wounds are treated, until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of sharp tears and catarrhs affecting the eyes from the interior of the head.
Chapter V.
When sharp, acrid, and persistent catarrhs affect someone, and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their vision already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs falling from them, and there is a sharp, painful pain deep in the head, with consequent sneezing: then understand from these occurrences that those materials and catarrhs do not come except from many veins.
And the best treatment in these cases is this.
And it is that you instruct the patient to shave his forehead.
Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or a little to one side, beginning the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision go as far as the bone; and keep your hand away from the temples which move during mastication, until the bone is uncovered; and you shall wipe away all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with old cotton or linen threads.
Then bind it above with pledgets; and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you unbind it, and see that the hot abscess is diminishing, then it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen which causes flesh to grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of resin; and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the ear. Chapter VI. Whatever falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water and vinegar, and things like them; or some animal.
When, therefore, a stone falls into the ear, or a kind of stone from among those which are not added to, nor grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if then you see the stone, then instill into the ear something of violet oil, or sesame oil.
Then manage its extraction, and make him sneeze with sneezing powders, and block the nostrils at the approach of sneezing, after you have placed pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and extend the ear upwards.
For very often it comes out with this treatment.
But if it does not come out, then manage its extraction with hooks, that is, with fine probes: whose form is this.
If therefore it comes out with hooks, it is good.
And if not, then manage its extraction with a small, blunt hook of few windings. If therefore it does not come out through that, then make a cannula of bronze, and insert the end of the cannula into the hole of the ear deeply, and stop up what is around the cannula with wax softened with oil, so that there is no way for the wind except the cannula: then extract it with your strong wind suction. For very often it comes out with what we have described.
But if it does not come out in this way: then take from helkalimbat, or from birdlime, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it on the end of a probe after you have neatly wrapped cotton around it: then insert it into the hole of the ear easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not come out with all that we have described, then hasten to make an incision, before a hot abscess or a spasm occurs.
And the method of incision is that the phlebotomist first bleeds the patient in the cephalic vein: and draw out blood from him according to the measure of his strength.
Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fat in a depressed place: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever instruments you can.
Then sew up the incision quickly, and take care of it until it heals.
But if the thing which has fallen into the ear is one of the grains which grow and swell, then manage its extraction.
But if it does not yield to exit, then take a thin, delicate spatula, according to this shape.
And use it to cut away that kind of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain has been moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you have broken it into many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with a thin probe, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is thereby eased.
In the case of water entering the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with the head inclined; and he should fill his ear with some old lint; and he should lie on the ear into which the water has entered.
If therefore it comes out through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, about the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the patient insert one of them into the opening of his ear: and let him stand on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear.
Therefore let him not cease doing this with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
And then the water comes out so that you take one of papyrus or of rush, and insert one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Then repeat with another rush, and do this many times, until all the water comes out: and draw it out with a tube as was previously described for the stone.
But in the extraction of an animal entering into it, if it is of small body, like a flea and the like, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which is apparent to the senses: then manage its extraction with forceps and hooks: and its matter is easier than all those things which are held in the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you look into the ear in the sun.
If therefore something of worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with thin hooks.
But if nothing appears there, then take a tube, of which this is the form, narrow below, wide above: and insert the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates: then suck with it with strong suction.
Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
But if they do not obey you to exit, then seal the circumference of the tube with wax, as I said in the case of the stone.
But if they do not come out with what we have said: then administer distillations which the ancients have already experienced in killing worms: and you will find that in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring, whereby you pour oils and medicines into the ear, be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
As you see, make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, with a small hole, wide above.
Therefore let that which pushes what is in the concavity of the tube be made of bronze, decently fashioned.
And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap cotton around its end with a neat wrapping: then pour oil, or juice, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear: then insert the rod with the cotton on top, and press it with your hand with a moderate compression, until the oil is impelled into the concavity of the hearing, and the patient feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear should have been warmed a little with fire: and beware that the thing which is distilled into it is not very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
Concerning the treatment of the obstruction happening in the ear.
Chapter VII.
Sometimes certain infants emerge from the wombs of their mothers imperforate.
And it has also happened to some men that there is an obstruction in the passage of the ear from a wound, or from flesh grown there.
And this obstruction sometimes occurs in the depth of the opening of the ear, which sight does not reach; and sometimes it happens near the exterior of the opening, and sight reaches it.
Therefore that which happens in the depth of the ear, and which sight does not reach, is in most instances difficult of cure.
And in that which sight reaches, it is necessary that you put the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look into it: then if you see the apparent obstruction, open it with a thin spatula, whose form is this which follows, let its extremity in which there is a certain small width, have a certain sharp part: and let the rest of the spatula be of two smooth sides: so that it does not injure the ear.
If therefore the obstruction is from flesh grown in the passage of the ear: then hold it with a thin hook, and cut it with great ease, until all the flesh is removed.
But if the obstruction is in the depth of the ear: then take a thin, smooth probe, and heat it slightly with fire: then put it into the passage of the ear.
If therefore you feel the obstruction with it, which the sick person finds with heaviness of hearing, attempt its opening with ease: and beware lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Then put into the ear a pledget according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days, until you are sure of the healing of the wound.
Or take a pledget, and dip it in rose water, and sprinkle on it crushed vitriol, and use it.
But if you see the ear already becoming abscessed: then it is necessary that you remove the pledget, and leave it with another pledget, which you will wrap in cerate which is made with rose oil, until the warm abscess settles: then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge, or cloths in cold water, and place it over the ear: and use the remaining treatment, which stops the flow of blood, mentioned in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of a stye on the eyelids.
Chapter VIII. Those styes which occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary to grasp them with forceps or with a hook, and to incise them with a spatula from their roots.
Then apply crushed verdigris to the areas.
But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lenticular cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after incision.
For often they return when something remains of their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of hailstones of the eyelid.
Chapter IX.
It often happens in the eyelids that something is similar to a hailstone in its strength and hardness, and because of that it is called a hailstone: and it is an aggregation of thick humidity in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider then, if it is a hailstone proceeding in it, which appears from the eyelid, and moves to every part, and its matter is easy.
Therefore find a fissure on it lengthwise.
Then scrape it from every side easily until it comes out.
Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
But if its excision is not prepared for you except after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the patient in something.
But if the fissure is large, then join it with a suture and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For the ointment restores it and fills it with flesh.
And if the hailstone slopes towards the interior of the ear towards the inner surface, then invert the eyelid and suspend the hailstone with a hook; except that you need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is lengthened by incision, it does no harm in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the hailstone with salt water, and treat the place with that which causes it to fill with flesh, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Axirnath of the eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is fat which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid; and it happens most to boys; and it weighs down their eyes, and catarrhs happen to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them; and because of that you see them lying down on their faces always, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, which swelling has already covered; and indeed the prominence of Axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
And the method of its operation is that the sick person puts his head in your bosom.
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare a pledget in it, and make from that pledget a circle according to the quantity which contains the Axirnath on every side.
Then put it over it, and press with your fingers on every side, so that the Axirnath may be gathered in the middle of the circle.
Then make a cut in the middle of that moisture with a suitable lancet, making fissures in width, and let the fissure not be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it is necessary that you cut the whole skin until you arrive at the Axirnath; for in many dispositions the Axirnath proceeds from the fissure according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Therefore extract it with the cloth, which you have infiltrated between your fingers to the outside: and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and beware that you do not add to the fissure, so that you do not arrive with the lancet to the eye, and injure it.
But if the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you add a little to the fissure easily, until the Axirnath comes forth.
Then extract it, as we said.
Then immerse cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and bind it with powders.
And some men grind salt, and put it in the hollow of the fissure, so that what remains of that moisture may be liquefied.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But if it happens in a place of a warm abscess, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Concerning the ways of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye is softened, whence it is wrinkled as it ought not to be.
Chapter XI.
When superfluous hairs are born in the eyelids of the eye beyond the course of the natural hairs, and grow: then they harm the eye, and cause various sicknesses, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and leucoma, until it becomes the cause of destruction of the eye.
And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed cured according to four methods. Or by cautery with fire.
Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was premised in the chapter on cautery.
Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture.
Or by tubes, according to what I shall say.
It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it is turned, it is good.
And if not: insert a needle into it, on which is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a radius.
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula extending from the larger lachrymal gland to the smaller lachrymal gland.
Then remove the thread, and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton or cloth: then mark above the eyelid with a cautery, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape is made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: because it is now diversified in men.
For there are some who require that a large quantity be incised from the eyelid, according to the quantity which is softened from the eyelid. Then with a spatula incise upon the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger lachrymal gland to the smaller lachrymal gland, and let there be one fissure near the natural hairs, such as is the thickness of a ray.
Then introduce a hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then flay it entirely. Then unite with a suture the two lips, with needle and fine woolen thread: and wipe away the blood, and make adhere what superabounds of the threads over the two eyebrows, with some sticky things, if you wish to do it: and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the suture and threads up to three days, or four: afterwards treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts.
For the eyelid is raised at the closing of the wound and its union: but it will be better in the future.
The ancients taught this method of treatment, Ataxmir.
Nevertheless, there is concern for the patient, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is also in Ataxmir: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have related.
Then raise the eyelid with three hooks separated, or joined together, according to this form which follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with an even incision.
But if it is not possible for you to hold a hook, and it is not equal: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and a second thread near the smaller lacrimal duct: and gather the threads together between your fingers evenly.
Then raise your hand with an even raising: and raise the skin upon which the whole has been marked, as we have related.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and take care of it until it is healed.
But if an abscess should occur at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with cerate, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that their hairs are turned.
Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
And it is, that you should turn back the eyelid, and incise the fissure which is inside, according to what I have related.
Then skillfully make two reeds, or two slender pieces of wood: whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a spatula: and you have already incised at the extremities of each on both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully apply each on that which is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and bind the two reeds on both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days. For the constricted skin will die, and will blacken, and will putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then incise it with scissors.
Then take care of it, until it is healed.
When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two cannulas, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
Concerning the elevation of hairs pricking in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The operation in that is, that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread. Then you bring together its ends, and knot each one with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place in the Alinxotati another fine thread under it shortly, and knot its ends if you wish.
Then let the patient place his head in your bosom, and let it be near the sun so that the operation may be clearly seen: because it is a subtle, or minute, operation.
Then insert the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you pull out a natural hair from above.
Then pull the hair up above the Alinxotati: and insert that hair into the Alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the Alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair.
But if the Alinxotati is pulled, and the hair does not come out with it: you will pull the Alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you placed in it, until the Alinxotati comes out from the upper opening, and you see it with the sight of your eye: then indeed you will pull the Alinxotati, and the thread: and pull out both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and lift it with it: or leave it, until it lengthens after a time, and then lift it.
Concerning the care of the Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental, therefore, it is made from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operation in it is that you split that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and you place between them a pledget of linen, and you bind it, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things which dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek: and embrocate with water in which mallow has been cooked, linseed: and diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some of the oils: and wrap with it a pledget, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all your ingenuity that it not consolidate, according to the form which it was in the beginning.
And this operation which we have spoken of, is nothing but a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return completely to what it was. Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which happens in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which happens below, is that which is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental one happens from a wound, or fissure, or cautery, and similar things.
And the way of operating in it is that you take a needle, in which there is double thread, and you dip it in flesh, and you make it penetrate from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread arrives at the two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and incise it with a broad spatula.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it ought, it is good.
And if not, take a radius, and put it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is made from them: until when they are joined their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts; sew it with a wool thread.
Then treat them with what we have spoken of, softening medicines and liniments, until they are healed.
And if an abscess occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what preceded.
Then separate the two lips with a liniment, according to what we said.
And the sum of the discussion about the treatment of an abscess, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to how the abscess is prepared.
For it itself is of many diversities in form: and a prudent surgeon prepares the method with whichever way is possible for him, until he restores the shape to the natural form, or near it, and the patient himself, according to what is suitable for him from the operation and instruments in many preparations.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many men, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural functions.
Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of a probe under the eyelid, and lift it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then incise the adhesion with a thin spatula, which is not with the sharpness of cutting spatulas, but rather is somewhat blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and injures the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you flay that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the whole adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, wash it with water: or instill into it from a sieve made from ziniar dissolved with water.
Then separate the eyelid and eye with a linen cloth: and place on the eye wool infused with egg white: and after the third day use a sieve, and with solidifying agents, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of the tears.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the nail is according to two methods. Or it is sinewy: and it is similar to hard, thin fat.
Or it is not sinewy, similar to congealed white moisture: which when iron touches it, or you try to seize it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not fix in it.
And both kinds do not begin except from the greater lachrymal [duct], until it goes gradually, until it covers the sight, and prevents light and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operating on its incision is: that the infirm person put his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Then collect the ungula with a hook of little curvature, and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hair of a horse, or an ox, or a cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the ungula: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the ungula with thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the ungula which follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair up to its end.
Then incise the remainder at the root of the lachrymal duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the lachrymal duct, so that a constant flow of tears does not occur from its incision.
And sometimes the ungula is extended with a hook alone; or with thread, as we have said.
Then scrape it with a smooth spatula, of which this is the form.
And beware lest the spatula touch the cornea, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be perforated.
Then after the incision, throw into the eye some crushed salt, or something made from ziniar, and leave it until the next day.
Then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed. But if the nail is not sinewy, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is treated many times with medicines, and is healed as I have described in the division.
But if you wish to incise it, then open the eye of the patient, and take a thin, smooth spatula of weak sharpness, according to this form.
And shave the nail from above carefully with subtlety.
But if you see that it is rarefied and broken, and the shaving impresses upon it, then distill from your hour into the eye a decoction made from ziniar, or from red sief, or crushed salt: and plug the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation on it until the whole of it is removed.
Unless there is a warm abscess in the eye contrary to this: for then leave it, and treat the abscess until it is healed. Then repeat the operation on it with reason, until it is healed.
However, if the prominence of the fleshy lachrymal caruncle causes great harm to the eye, suspend it with a hook and incise part of it; and do not extend the incision, so that the flow of tears may not be affected.
Then instill into the lachrymal duct red wine or a preparation made from verdigris, until it is healed. Concerning the incision of Alguardenic and the flesh born in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes a red, fleshy growth develops in the eyes of certain people, either superimposed or covering the pupil, or approaching it, or constricting it over the eyelids, and perhaps turning the eyelids outward; and it resembles a wild rose.
And the operation in this case is that the patient should place his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes and collect all that flesh with hooks suitable for it; and hold it with one forceps, or a pair.
Then incise the flesh first, until you have finished the whole of it with a scalpel.
And beware of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation; and let your incision, with which you incise it, be either with a spatula, which we have described in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors, with which the asebel is collected, according to what its form will be after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is completed, and all the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or instill into it red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines; and place over the eye externally cotton with egg white: so that it may be secured from a hot abscess.
But if some of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which soothes an abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
And similarly do with the added flesh which occurs in the eye from this species.
However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of any weak eye, from a natural or accidental cause, by operating with iron; and do not introduce your hand into any of these operations, until you see that the member is tolerating that operation.
Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. Sebel are red veins which are woven over the eye, and prevent the sight from performing its function; and weaken the eye with the length of days.
It is necessary for you, therefore, first, to consider if the eye in which is the Sebel is strong, and there is no illness in it other than the Sebel: then collect its Sebel.
And it is so that you should instruct the patient to place his head in your bosom.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment: and let the hook be a fine double one, according to this form, or let there be two hooks joined in one body, according to this form.
Then collect with fine scissors those veins with subtlety, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are resolved: and beware lest you injure the eye with the ends of the spatula.
And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you do not cut except those veins.
And when you have finished, then distill into the eye green or red vitriol: so that by its sharpness it may corrode what remains of the sebaceous matter.
But if it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye: and leave it for a few days, until its pain is settled: and it is secure from a hot abscess: then repeat on it according to the same method, until it is healed.
And this is the shape of the scissors.
Concerning the reduction of the nasal bone.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharp burning medicine, according to what has preceded its description, Arissati.
And if it is not healed, then there is no other method than to incise above the abscess at its origin, and to draw out all the moisture and pus which is in it, until the bone is uncovered.
When therefore the bone is uncovered, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose shape is this.
And it is called the rough head.
Let it be made of untempered iron, and let its head be round like an awl, which is pointed with the pointing of a file, or with the pointing of an aliskilfer, a fine pointing: and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone. Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption is scraped away: and do this several times.
Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption is scraped away: and do this several times. Then restore the place with drying astringent medicines.
If then the place is consolidated, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is stopped: and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not fester, and no accident happens in it: then know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no remedy but to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this form.
And it is, that you uncover from the second bone with an iron, or with a sharp medicine: and when the bone is uncovered, then take a trephine of this form, let its iron extremity be triangular: and let its wooden part be a pyramid tapering to the end, as you see.
Then place it upon the bone itself: and let it be near the lacrimal duct: and lengthen your hand from the eye a little.
Then revolve your hand with the trephine, until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: by this, that he finds wind to come out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with drying styptic medicines, as I have taught you.
When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens: then the matter which was poured out externally, returns to the nose: therefore it is lighter upon the patient.
Concerning the reduction of a protrusion of the eye. Chapter 20.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision: then it is necessary that you loosen the patient; then you should bleed him; afterwards you should apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then place on the eye an ointment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and olibanum, and sarcocol.
Then bind the eye from above over a plaster with many powders.
And the method of the powders is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth of them is doubled over fourfold: make many of them: then place them one upon another, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then bind over them with a hard cloth with a strong binding.
And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound day and night.
But if the binding is again softened, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly: then remove the binding after a day and night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye has returned to the tunic of the grape, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and the powders, and the binding, and the cupping glasses, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the grape tunic.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the tunic of the grape, then it protrudes and comes forth outside the eyelids like a grape seed, and the appearance of the man is disfigured by it, and he wishes to incise it: then the operation on it is as I relate: and it is that you insert a needle into the root of the grape from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle in which is a double thread from the lachrymal side, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Then incise the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the grape around the needle; and tighten it greatly.
Then withdraw the needle, and place on the eye wool infused in egg white; and leave it until the thread falls with the grape.
Then care for the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the grape is constricted from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds a great prominence.
Then it is perforated with a thin spatula, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and the white moisture flows, and the eye descends, and enters immediately; then tighten it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of alcomnati.
Chapter XXII.
This sickness which is called alcomnati is nothing but pus which gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
And the method of operating on it is that you make the sick person sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Then take his head with your hands from two sides, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Then let it be fixed, and not descend, and the light is resolved: and let the sick person see things as he saw: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula, and pierce with it above the corneal film a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the crown, until the pus comes out.
When therefore it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then let it be treated with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water which descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter 23.
We have already spoken of the species of water in the division, and what is suitable for perforation by explaining and expounding discourse; then take the same according to health.
Then therefore it is necessary that you make the infirm one sit between your hands squarely, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his sound eye, and bind it tightly: then the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which is the water is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then take with your right hand an almond, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then place the end of the almond near the cornea by the thickness of a ray in the very apparent whiteness of the smaller lachrymal eye: then push the almond with force: and you roll your hand with it, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the almond has now arrived at the empty thing.
And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the almond to the depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the cornea of the eye.
For you will see them in the very pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Then place the almond until the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his vision immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Then rest a little.
If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, except that the almond comes out.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the almond with ease: and you revolve your hand gradually. Then dissolve something of clear gem salt in water: and wash the eye with it inside.
Then place outside the eye a whole pledget, or wool infused with rose oil and egg white: and bind with it the healthy eye.
We, however, and those who are of our time, place upon it crushed cumin with egg white.
But if the almond does not obey you at entry into the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose form is this.
Therefore pierce with it only the conjunctiva, and do not put your hand in the opening: and it is only so that you make a subtle way to the place of the almond.
Then introduce the almond, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, let a properly made bed be prepared for the patient, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room: and let him be forbidden from all movements, and from coughing: and put his food that by which his nature is soothed: and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage remain in its place until the third day. Then untie it in that dark room, and test his vision: and make him see things.
Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not necessary that he do this at the hour of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather it is necessary that he avoid it: because water quickly ascends through intense staring.
But if a warm abscess occurs, then it is necessary to untie the eye before the seventh day: and treat it with that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed; then restore its vision, and place on his face an oral medication by which his vision may be regulated for a few days, while he remains in that dark room.
Then let him gradually leave the house, and converse in his own rooms.
And know that in surgery the student is not excused from vision sometimes: then indeed let him dare to perform the operation.
And now indeed there has come to us a certain one of those who are from Alayrach, who said that there was made in Alayrach a perforated tube, by which water is sucked.
Truly therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has made it: nor have I read of it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the kinds of tube, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon them.
Let them be made of bronze properly: and let their ends be triangulated with this same thinness, and a sharp point.
Forms of tube.
Concerning the treatment of flesh grown in the nose.
Chapter 24.
Sometimes various kinds of flesh grow in the nose, of which some resemble a scorpion with many feet; and of this there is cancerous flesh, stony, dark in color; and of this there is flesh which is soft, not dark in color.
Therefore, in that which of these fleshes is soft, not malignant, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and insert a hook into that flesh; then draw it outwards, and cut what you have grasped of it with a sharp, thin spatula from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
But if something remains of it whose excision is not possible, then shave it with one of the thin instruments easily, until nothing of it remains.
But if the blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is necessary; or if it is of malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Then vinegar and water, or wine, should be poured into the nose after the incision.
But if the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that he is now healthy.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then it is necessary that you insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place between each knot the quantity of a finger, or less; and let the sick person contrive to insert one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it similar to an azer; and let him draw his breath until it reaches the cavity, and emerges above his throat.
And indeed, boys often do something similar to this in schools; and it is an easy thing for anyone who wants to.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which emerges above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Then take and saw the flesh with the knots which are on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread: and put into the nose after wiping away the blood a pledget which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then, at the end of the process, place a lead tube in the nose for a few days, until it heals.
If, however, it needs treatment which dries, use that.
To make a head-purging instrument, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze: let it be like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its channel similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for performing head-purging should be full, open; to which there should be a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish of juices and fluid things.
And this is the form of the instrument. Concerning the care of nasal polyps.
Chapter 25.
Often a polyp grows at the tip of the nose, and it becomes large and increases with the days, until its appearance becomes foul.
And because of that it is necessary that you cut it in the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it.
Then place on the location either a cautery or a burning medicine which stands in its place.
If therefore its incision is delayed until it becomes large, then consider if it is stony, hard, dark in color, and insensitive: then do not touch it with iron; because it is a cancerous abscess.
For many times I have seen someone incise such an abscess, and great harm resulted to the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that its incision is possible in its entirety, then empty the diseased area, and incise it without fear: and treat the place with that which dries and constricts until it is healed.
Concerning the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when a discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, the operation benefits little, except in certain men.
Therefore, when something like this happens to someone, you must consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood; and then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture; then treat it until it heals.
And if the lips of the discontinuity are already separated, and each part has healed: then it is necessary to scrape away all the part from its apparent skin, until it bleeds.
Then bring together the two lips with a suture, and tighten them, and powder over it dragon's blood and crushed olibanum: and place over the powders a piece of diachylon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then unbind it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads are cut off by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is to bring together the discontinuity, either with needles, as we have narrated in the suturing of the belly: or bring together the discontinuity with thread, as I have made you know.
Concerning the extraction of knots from the lips.
Chapter XXVII. Indeed, many people often have hard abscesses similar to grains of barley in their inner lips; and some of them are smaller, and others larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you evert the lip, and incise above each knot, and suspend it with a hook, and incise it on every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with powdered alum, until the bleeding stops.
Then let it be washed with vinegar, and let the place be treated with it, wherein is astringency, until the wounds are healed.
Concerning the incision of flesh grown upon the gum.
Chapter XXVIII. Often there grows upon the gum an added flesh, which the ancients call abuluss.
Therefore it is necessary that you suspend it with a hook: or hold it with forceps, and incise it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
Then place upon the place crushed egg white, or other astringent, drying powders.
But if that flesh returns after treatment, for often it does return, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with iron.
Chapter XXIX.
Sometimes rough, foul crusts gather on the surfaces of the teeth, on the inner and outer sides, and between the gums; and sometimes they blacken, and become yellow and green, until corruption from them reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through it.
Therefore it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth, on which you see crusts and something like sand, until nothing of it remains; and similarly do with the blackness, greenness, yellowness, and others until they are cleansed.
If therefore that which is in them is removed from the beginning of the scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them on another day, a second, and a third, until at last your intention is achieved in what you wish.
And know that a tooth needs scrapers of diverse forms, many shapes, according to what is prepared for your operation; therefore, the scraper with which a tooth is scraped from below is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms.
And these forms of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you see.
Concerning the extraction of aching teeth.
Chapter 30.
It is necessary that you treat the tooth for its pain with all skill, and delay in its eradication.
For there is nothing that supplies its place when it is eradicated; because it is a sublime substance: until when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary when the patient is compelled to eradicate it, so that it may be strengthened, and the aching tooth be made certain to you.
For often pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a sound tooth and eradicates it: then the pain does not depart, until the diseased tooth is eradicated.
For we have already seen this from the operation of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is made certain to you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side: then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you shake it.
Then place large forceps on it in a good position, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have now held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it on every side with ease, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
But if the tooth is perforated, or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with a cloth: and bind it with the end of a thin rod, so that it is not broken at the time of your tightening upon it with forceps.
And it is necessary that you act skillfully with scarification around the gum on every side very much.
And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and a greater evil than its first pain returns upon the patient from it.
And beware lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and boldness concerning its eradication, except what we have described.
For very often they cause great illnesses to happen to men, which are more difficult to break, and all its roots, or some of them, remain; or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have often testified to that. Then let it be washed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt. But if bleeding occurs from the places (for it often happens), then grind some zegi and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long ends, a short, thick handle, so that they do not bend when pressure is applied to the tooth with them: let them be like you see thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not give way, nor bend: short ends, and let them be made of good iron, or of properly made steel, with straight ends: and at their ends let there be teeth, some of which enter into others, and grip with a decent, strong constriction.
And sometimes the ends are made like the shape of the mouth of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jaw bones.
Chapter XXXI.
When, in the eradication of a tooth, something of it remains, then it is necessary to place a poultice with butter on the place for one or two days, until the place softens: then introduce into it a hook, or forceps: the ends of which resemble the mouth of a bird which is called a stork.
This then is the shape of the forceps.
Let their ends be made like a file within: or like aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you search for the root, and uncover all the flesh, and introduce the instrument which is called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short in the extremity, somewhat thick: and let it not be soft, lest it break.
If therefore the root comes out through it, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first is triangular at the extremity, in which there is a certain thickness.
The form of a triangular extremity, slender.
It is also helped with this instrument having two branches, of which this is the form. And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the matter of teeth.
Also let there be help with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of this form, of a twisted triangular extremity, in which there is some thickness, so that it is not broken: and let it not be imbibed.
And know that the instruments for teeth are many: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and a skillful artisan, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument, according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves signify to him.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not mention an instrument, because of the diversity of their kinds.
But if a bone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then investigate it in its place with that which suits it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with a gest, whose form is this.
Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone may be tightened, or held with it, and not escape and go, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable for it.
But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then shave it from its putrefaction, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the sawing of teeth prominent above others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, the form is made foul; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, those who are for sale.
For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and is not located, or its sawing or filing is possible, then eradicate it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then incise it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of strong iron, very sharp at the end.
And let your incision, by which you incise it, be in many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not moved.
But if it is prominent and exposed to its filing, then file it with a file of iron, of which this is the form.
Let it be entirely of iron, and its handle of very small points, like a file with which needles are made; with which the tooth may be filed gradually in many days easily, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain scrapers.
But if it is a tooth, from which a part is broken, and injures the tongue: then it is necessary that you file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made even: and smoothed, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
Concerning the retention of teeth with gold threads.
Chapter XXXIII.
When a shaking and concussion happens to the front teeth from a blow or a fall: and the sick person cannot bite on what he eats so that it does not fall out: and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment has not worked: then the method is that they be tied with a gold thread: because silver turns green, and rots after days: but gold never changes.
And let the thread be medium in thinness and thickness according to the amount that it takes between the teeth.
And the method of retention is, that you take a thread, and insert the double of it between two sound teeth; then weave with the two ends of the thread between the moved teeth, whether it is one, or more, until you arrive with the weaving up to a sound tooth of the other side.
Then repeat the weaving up to the part from which you began: and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not removed completely: and let your constriction with which you tighten the thread, be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not escape.
Then cut the superfluous ends of the thread with scissors: and join both, and turn them with a tool: and hide them between the sound tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue: then let it remain so bound.
If however it is loosened, or cut, bind them with another thread, and it will remain with it thus for the whole time.
And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the retention of two sound teeth, and two moved teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return after the fall of both into their places, and are retained as we have narrated, and remain: and this is done only by a skilled, prudent, and experienced craftsman.
And sometimes something is fitted from the bones of animals: and it is made like the form of a tooth, and is placed in the place from which the tooth is strengthened and bound, as we have said: and it remains, and serves for a long time.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which happens under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Chapter 34.
But if in it there shall be something of hardness and knotting, and it shall be from the healing of a wound: then throw into it a hook, and split it across, until you incise the ligament, and the knotting is loosened.
But if a flow of blood happens, then place pounded alum on the place. But if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a sluggish cautery, which is suitable for it: then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed. Concerning the extraction of a ranula which forms under the tongue.
Chapter 35.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue which is similar to a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it is magnified so much, until it fills the mouth.
If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, to which the sick person does not feel sensation: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then throw into it a hook, and incise it with a thin spatula, and free it from every part.
But if blood overcomes you at the time of your operation, then put on it crushed alum, until the blood is stopped: then return to your operation, until you extract it with its entirety.
Then let it be washed with vinegar and salt: and treat it with the remaining appropriate treatment for it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then either you will perforate it: or it will break by itself.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then it ought to be incised.
And the operation in it is that you consider before its operation if the heat of its abscess has quieted completely, or is diminished by some lessening: then therefore make the infirm one sit before the sun, and let his head be in your bosom: and open his mouth, and let a servant take [a tool] between his hands, and press his tongue down below with an instrument, of which this is the form. Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is as thin as a small knife.
When therefore you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, except that you draw with it something of the membranes.
Then incise it with an instrument, of which this is the form which follows.
It is similar to scissors: however, let its ends be curved, so that the opening of each of them is directly opposite the other sharply: therefore take care that it is made of untempered iron, or alfuled soaked [in something].
But if this instrument is not present, then incise it with a spatula, of which this is the form.
Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you incise one tonsil, incise the other according to this same kind of incision.
Then after the incision let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
But if a flow of blood should happen to him, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and things similar to them from among the styptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses are produced in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore incise them according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I indeed once treated a woman from an abscess which had formed between her throat, which pulled towards blackness, little feeling, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed through a narrow passage, and it had already forbidden her eating, and drinking water: and she had already come to death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had put out two branches, until they came out above the two openings of the nose.
Therefore I hastened, and fixed a hook in one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out from it.
Then I cut it off where it reached the opening of the nose.
Then I did the same to that which protruded from the other opening of the nose.
Then I opened its mouth and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut off a part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it: therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
Therefore I did not cease to incise that abscess many times over a long period: and the abscess kept reappearing in the place which I incised, until it became very long and with it that.
Therefore I devised a plan, and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
So it stopped from increasing; then I went away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
Concerning the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When catarrh descends to the uvula and forms an abscess, and it is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we have described in the division, and the treatment is not effective, and you see that the hot abscess has subsided from it, and it is thin; then it is necessary to incise it.
And what is gathered from it that is round, and has no length, and is bloody, or brown in color, or black, and has no feeling; then it is necessary to avoid incising it.
For in that there is fear for the patient.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I have described, from its whiteness and its length, you should make the patient sit before the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument, the description of which precedes: then fix a hook in the uvula, and pull it downwards: and incise it with one of the two instruments which I described for the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you not incise from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you incise more of it, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use what we have narrated in the incision of the two tonsils: and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision: then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
And the method of cauterization in it is not, except with a sharp instrument: and it is, that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then press his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned.
Then take of the water which I told you in the chapter on cauterization, and mix with it unslaked lime, and put it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the form.
Let the extremity of it in which the medicine is placed have a concavity, like the concavity of a spoon.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself: and let the sick person lie on his side, so that the saliva from his mouth may run from the inside of the medicine, so that nothing may descend from it to his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you hold it over the uvula for half an hour, until you see it already blackened, and the biting of the medicine calmed.
And if you wish to take a pledget, and wrap it around the end of a spoon, and soak the pledget with medicine, and insert the spoon with the pledget into the tube from above, until the pledget adheres to the uvula. Do this many times, until you obtain what you wish of the cauterization of the uvula.
Then leave it: for it itself dries and falls after three or four days.
But if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe around the uvula with a pledget soaked in butter, and clean with it what is around it of the medicine: and rinse with cold water.
And let it be treated externally with lotions, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Therefore this method of treatment is healthier than incision and further from fear.
And sometimes the uvula is also cured with something finer than cautery and incision: for it is cured with fumigation, in this way.
Take calamint, and hyssop, and oregano, and rue, and sage, and chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs: and combine all of them, or some of them in a pot, and let them be submerged with vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be carefully luted with clay: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this way.
Let it be made of silver or bronze: and let the end, in which there is a pomegranate, be inserted into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor ascends to the uvula through a small tube, until the uvula is much darkened.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, lest you do this treatment at the beginning of the arrival of the abscess.
For it often adds to the abscess: and it is not fitting that you do it except at the decline of its hot abscess.
But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube, and place on its end an eggshell: so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned; because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is from good treatment with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Often a bone, or fishbone, or something else sticks in the throat.
Therefore it is necessary that you extract that which of them is apparent upon which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument towards the sun, and it is revealed to you what is in the throat.
And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the sick person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or let the sick person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a piece of dry bread: or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge: and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it.
When therefore it arrives at the place where the thorns or bone are, and is extracted, then it comes out. If therefore it does not come out with what we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be somewhat thicker than a radius, and at its end let there be a curve, which he may easily insert into his throat: and let him have his head raised upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest coughing should occur, and drive the bone or thorn forward, or let the physician insert it with his hand.
But that the patient himself inserts it is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing: and let him push downwards, or draw his hand upwards with the instrument, all of it according to the amount which is prepared for him, until it comes out.
Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Chapter 39.
When a leech is treated with what I have mentioned in the division on treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then examine the patient's throat in front of the sun, or by the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument I described to you.
If therefore your sight falls upon a leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine tweezers delicately.
But if it is not possible with them, then take a concave cannula, and insert it into the patient's throat as far as the throat: then insert into the concavity of the cannula an iron heated with fire.
Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from water the whole day.
Then let him take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
But if it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with bugs, or with asafoetida with the instrument which I described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this many times, because it itself will fall.
And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals with fire: and the pot is covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then throw in the fumigation, and let the patient put his mouth on the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has now reached the leech.
For the leech will immediately fall.
But if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty things and garlic, and not drink water. Therefore it is necessary that it come out with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon the uvula.
It is similar to forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
And its end is similar to the beak of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is a roughness like a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and treatment in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many kinds of abscesses, of many types, according to what comes to mind of them, namely one, and one in this book: and they differ in their perforation, and incision of them in two ways.
One of which is from the species of abscess in itself, and that which it contains of humors.
And the second way is because of the places in which it happens in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And among abscesses there are some which it is not necessary to perforate, except after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion: and among them there are some which it is necessary to perforate while they are raw, and not matured according to completion.
Such as abscesses which are near the joints.
Because when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its duration is prolonged, until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: wherefore it is a more proximate cause of the contraction of that limb.
Or there is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either it, or through it the principal member.
Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it immature: and it is not necessary to perforate a raw abscess, of incomplete digestion, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its end that which is not healed. It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of an abscess, which is matured according to its completion: and it is at the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuteness of the head of the abscess: and other signs. And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and of more vehement prominence: and let the perforation go in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of muscles, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places, where there is no reflection.
But in those which are reflected, go with the perforation according to that member.
When however the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better that you delay its perforation, until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there is much filth and dirt, and perhaps its lips and its depth harden.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the breadth of the body when necessary: or according to that which the member needs.
And it is necessary that you administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a large perforation: or many incisions similar to the size of the abscess.
And there are some abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be hollowed out: and incised when it has become like a cloth, and has reached the point that it is dead: as that which happens in many, like boils and buboes.
And some of them are cut with a three-angled incision.
And some of them are incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like an inguinal abscess.
And some of them are treated with a round incision, and a lunate incision: and similar incisions to them.
However, that which has no head, such as are soft superficial abscesses, it is necessary to pierce it with a superficial or only flat perforation.
And it is necessary, when an abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you do not hurry and remove all the pus at that time; rather remove only a part of it.
Then plug the abscess until another day.
Then remove some of the pus again.
Do this many times gradually, until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old and decrepit person; for the vital spirit is often dissolved from the body with the exit of pus: and perhaps the patient will die, and you will not understand.
Therefore beware of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, you must wipe the wound: and consider.
If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is even, then apply a linen cloth, or old cotton.
And if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then you must insert a linen cloth into each fissure, until they meet.
And if in the abscess you have cut away a part of the skin, or have hollowed it out around the edges: then you must fill it with old cotton, or as when cloth is woven, or is shaved with linen fluff without moisture: and bind it tightly until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary of ointment, until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth has been soaked in them: and apply it to the place of bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must apply the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places in this book, and in the division.
But if it is in wintertime, and the place of the abscess is one of many nerves: then it is necessary that you infuse little bags with warm wine and oil: and place them on the places.
And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you apply little bags soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all that cold.
Until, when it is the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and cleanse it, and apply to its treatment that which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
This therefore is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
According to the method of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, in what way there is a path to its treatment, chapter by chapter, individually.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur in the skin of the head.
Chapter XLI.
Small abscesses occur in the skin of the head, and they are of the species of Nodes, which contain tunics, which are sacs for them: as if they themselves were the wattles of a hen.
And their kinds are many.
Of these, some are fatty; and of these are those which contain a moisture similar to mud; and of these which contain a moisture similar to gruel and porridge; and similar to them; and of these are those which are hard and stony.
And in the incision of all, and their extraction there is no fear, provided that in their incision an artery does not oppose.
And the operation in their incision is that you should explore them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if that which it contains is moisture, then incise it with an incision according to the length with a superficial incision: according to this form.
And begin with the incision from line b. to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it at all.
For very often it returns, if anything of it remains. Then dip a pledget in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remains of the cyst. Then repeat on it with a pledget with Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing of the cyst remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
But if the abscess contains a fatty nodule, then cut it according to this form, the incision having the form of a cross: and throw hooks between the lips of the incision, and scrape it from every side: and try your strength in extracting the membrane which contains it.
But if an artery opposes you, then do what I shall tell you afterwards.
And similarly do in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said. And the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because it contains little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in certain men, with which there is completely no moisture.
Or place their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus may be relieved downwards.
Then treat them with what is suitable for them from treatment.
Concerning the incision of the Strophulae in the neck.
Chapter XLII.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And concerning those which occur in the neck, there is one, and many: and they are generated from one another: and every Strophula of them is within its own tunic, just as it is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the kinds of these Strophulae are many.
And of them some are stony: and of them some contain humors: and of them some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that one of them which you see of good disposition to the touch, whose apparent color is close to that of the skin, and it moves in every direction, and it is not connected with the nerves of the neck, nor with the jugular vein, nor with the artery, nor is it deep: you ought to cut it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line from b to g, and flay it on every side: and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is important to be cautious, lest a vein or nerve be cut.
And let the scalpel not be very sharp: lest it slip in your hand during the incision, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is unnecessary.
But if you cut a vein or artery, or if anything prevents you from operating, then put on the wound pounded alum, or some powders which stanch blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens: or it begins and wants to fester.
For the blood is stanched.  Therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Then take care of it.
If the whole pimple is incised, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and sew it up immediately, after you see that completely no excess remains.
But if you see that excess remains because of the size of the pimple, then it is necessary that you proceed to incise its root, and to extract it: and administer the suture which we have described.
And which of the pimples contains moisture, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that the place of its maturity may appear to you: and place the perforation from that which follows the lower part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer after the perforation a pledget with ointment, and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound already to be cleansed: then take care of it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients said that this incision is in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their words.
However, in those having synanche, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided: since no help is done by it; because all the veins and the lung are weak.
In those, however, who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in both tonsils, when there is no illness in the trachea, it is necessary to use incision of the epiglottis, to avoid the loss which happens from suffocation. Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should incise the epiglottis below three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across, in that which is between two circles, to the extent that the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage: and indeed this place is suitable for incision, since it is free of flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
But if the physician is timid, then it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Then let him incise the skin, until when he arrives at the trachea; let him avoid a blood vessel, if he sees any of them.
Then let him incise the membrane which we have described: and the incision of the trachea is indicated by the phlegm which comes out from it, with that which is broken, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time in which suffocation is feared is removed, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis.
The sum of this discourse which we have narrated is not an exposition except when they see that some of these abscesses has already blocked the throat of the sick person: and the sick person is close to death, and his breath wants to be cut: they go to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person breathes above the place of the wound with a certain respiration, and is saved from death: and for this reason they ordered to leave the wound open, until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is for three days, and as itself: then therefore they ordered to sew the wound, and to cure it, until it is healed.
And that which I saw myself is that a maidservant took a knife and put it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the lung's canal.
And I was called to her cure, and I found her roaring, as is the roar of the dying.
I uncovered therefore the wound, and found the blood which had come out from the wound small.
Therefore I was confident that she had not cut a vein, nor an artery; and wind was coming out from the wound.
I therefore cleansed and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed; and nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after days to a better state of health.
Therefore I say: that in the incision of the epiglottis there is no fear.
Concerning the incision of a throat hernia.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called a throat hernia, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is common in women.
And it is according to two ways: for it is either natural or accidental. In the natural one, certainly there is no pus.
The accidental one, however, is according to two ways: of which one is similar to fatty nodes.
And the other way is similar to an abscess which forms from the knotting of an artery.
And in it there is fear, and it is not fitting that presumption be made to it with iron, except in that which is small: and you test it, and investigate it with a probe.
If therefore you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected with any veins: then cut it, just as nodes are cut: and extract it with what contains it from the cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then explore the whole of it.
Then treat the place with what is necessary of treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision upon the kinds of Nodes.
Chapter XLV. There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already described all their kinds in the division: and it is necessary that I relate here the difference between a Node and an Exitura, since it is doubt-making. I say therefore, that when an Exitura is heat, and fever, and vehement pains, until the boiling over of superfluity is settled, and putrefaction is completed: then indeed fever and heat are quiet.
With a Node however there is not heat, nor fever, nor pains, and a kista sifachin contains them, which is a proper sac for them, and is according to the color of the body: and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, and greater and smaller.
And they are according to two kinds: either fat: or they contain humidity.
And the colors of humidity are many, according to what I said in the division. It is necessary therefore, when you arrive at the cure of a Node, that you examine it, and investigate it first with the instrument which is called Intromissum, according to what its form will be in the chapter which is after this.
And the method of investigating abscesses, and all Nodes is, that you take this instrument, and insert it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess: and you roll your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin.
Then move your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider that which comes out in its track.
If therefore a flowing humidity comes out, whatever color it may be: then incise it with a superficial incision, as I said in the other abscesses.
And if no humidity comes out in the track of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty: therefore incise over it with an incision having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and flay the skin from every part with ease: and keep the kistin if you can over it, so that you extract it whole with the Node.
But if the kistis bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it piecemeal, until nothing of it remains.
For if a little or much of it remains, the Node returns for the most part.
But if it overcomes you, and a little remains of it: then fill the wound at your completion with some sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place over it what sits a warm abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
If therefore the Node is large, then sew its two lips, and treat it with that which incarnates. But if you have a pulsating or non-pulsating vein opposed to you: then hasten, and fill the place with pounded zegi, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies, and the boiling of the blood rests: then return to incising what remains of the Node.
Concerning the instruments for cutting and piercing.
Chapter XLVI.
Of these are the shapes of the intromittents, and they are of three kinds.
For of them there is a large one, and of them there is a medium one, and of them there is a small one.
Let them be made of iron, with square ends neatly finished, so that they readily enter into the abscess.
And these are the shapes of the perforating instruments, and one of them is called *beris*, that is, perforating; and they are of three kinds.
For of them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating by means of them abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes from what is between them of bones.
And others are made round, smooth, soft, like large needles with which cushions are sewn, namely of bronze, or of brass, or iron, or silver. And the better ones of them are those which are made of bronze.
And they are also made from black lead, which are suitable so that by means of them fistulas may be explored, whose concavities have reflections, so that they may be gently reflected with those reflections.
And again they are of three kinds. Because some of them are long, some of them are medium, and some of them are short, according to the quantity of the size of the fistula and its stricture. The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds. Because some of them are simple, namely those which have one curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
And some of them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And some of them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and some of them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and skinned: and they are of three kinds: for there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Their ends which do the cutting are sharp, the other ends are not sharp: and they are not made thus, except that with them help is given in the skinning of nodes for fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that the sick person may be healed by them, and find some relief from the burning which he finds in the skinning of an abscess.
These are the magdae, and they are of three kinds.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to a probe with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end is a concealed spatula point: and in it it runs inwards and outwards when you wish, as you see.
The shape of spatulas which are hidden between the fingers in the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Let them be made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat long, as you see: and let them be of a fine workmanship.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be with you, large and small: that you may cut off blood with them quickly in necessity, and then when medicine is not present to you.
However, do not use them in the cutting off of blood in every place of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the calves of the leg, and the hip, and the calves of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar to them, from fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes small instruments are made from them, similar to nutshell cups, according to their form: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
Concerning the care of the breasts of men which are similar to the breasts of women.
Chapter 47.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are inflated at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they are similar to the breasts of women: and they remain badly inflamed.
Therefore, he who abhors that, ought to cut above the breasts with a lunate incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then flay all the fat.
Afterwards fill the wound with an incarnative medicine.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture, and treat it until it heals.
But if the nipple declines downwards, and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it ought to be incised on its two upper sides with two incisions similar to the shape of a crescent, each of which is joined with the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards flay the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about suture and powders, which is necessary for the treatment, until it heals.
But if you do not complete the incision of what you ought to incise, because of the patient's restlessness, or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a pledget soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Then treat it until it heals.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess which occurs under the armpit.
Chapter XLVIII. Those abscesses which occur under the armpit are of the hard kinds of strumae, which contain cysts, and some of them contain fluids.
Therefore those which contain fluids ought to be incised with a lunate incision, in this manner, from line b to line g.  Then when all that is in the abscess of pus is evacuated, then fill it with old lint, and leave it until another day.
Then let the lint be removed, and let it be treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
But if the abscess is of the kind of nodes of strumae, then incise upon it, as we said in the section on strumae equally.
But if the wound extends so that it discharges pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said before.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs because of an artery and a vein.
Chapter 49.
When an artery is ruptured and the skin which is above it is consolidated, then an abscess often occurs from this; and similarly it happens to a vein also, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are because of an artery and vein are: because, when the abscess is because of an artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a whistling in it.
And that which is because of a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is a mistake, especially that which is under the armpits, and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Therefore, its treatment with iron must be avoided, and that which is also among them in the extremities, or in the head, must be avoided.
Therefore, upon that which is among them from the swelling of the opening of an artery, make in the skin an incision lengthwise.
Then open the incision with hooks, afterwards the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is uncovered.
Then insert a needle under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie off the artery with double thread in two places, as I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood which is in it comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer treatment which generates pus, until the ligatures fall off: afterwards treat it with ointments suitable for it, until it is healed.
But if there is an abscess because of a section of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what is possible for you of the abscess with the skin.
Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you extract it from the other side.
Then tie the abscess with a good ligature: according to what I told you in the ligature of a grape, from two parts with two ends of thread. But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the needle: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until when that which is in it comes out: then incise the superfluous skin, and leave that which is tied from it.
Then place on it a small pillow which you have submerged in wine and oil.
Then administer the treatment, which is done with linen cloths and ointments, until it is healed.
Concerning the abscess which happens from the twisting of nerves.
Chapter L.
Just as an abscess happens in an artery and vein, similarly an abscess happens in the nerves: which happens in them through percussion, or happens from excessive labor, and similar things: and it happens most in those places of the joints, or heel, and in every place in which joints are moved: and it is a serious abscess. Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in most instances without pain: and when it is squeezed forcefully, the patient feels in it something like numbness.
And it is not an abscess gathered deep in the body, but rather it is under the skin, and it itself is moved to every part, and does not go forward, or before, nor backward behind.
Therefore, that which of them is in the joints, ought not to be invaded with iron.
Perhaps contraction will result.
But in that which of them is in the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
If therefore the abscess is small, then grasp it with forceps and cut it from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and flay it: then remove it, and close the wound with suture: and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the abdomen.
Chapter 51. Certain men often have in their abdomens, and in the rest of their bodies, swellings which are called fungals, because of their resemblance to fungi.
Whose root is thin, and their head is thick, and their lips are inverted.
And some of them are small; and some of them become very large.
And indeed I myself saw a man, and in his abdomen were two swellings, which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, with small roots, and their lips were inverted, and split, and moisture always ran from them.
Therefore I cut them open, and found in one about eighteen ounces and in the other about six ounces. And the procedure in cutting them open is that you should consider then, if the patient is moist, and the color of the swelling is white, moist, with a thin root: then cut it open with a broad spatula, and have cauteries in the fire at hand.
For very often much blood is expelled during its incision; therefore if the bleeding overcomes you, then cauterize it.
But if you see the patient is faint and fearful of incision with iron, then take a neatly made lead thread, and tie the swelling with it:  the method of which we have described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the constriction of the lead.
Therefore do not cease to tighten the lead, as often as it presses on the swelling, until it is cut off, and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the swelling has a thick root, then in its incision there is something of fear and apprehension, especially that which is in the abdomen.
Nevertheless, it is possible to incise half of it.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then take care of it until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you presume to incise a swelling which is dark in color, lacking in sensation, foul in appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess; and I will come to the discussion of Cancer after this.
Concerning the treatment of an umbilical hernia.
Chapter 52.
An umbilical hernia arises from many causes.
Or from fissures of the fascia which is over the belly; and from it protrudes fat or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood flowing from a vein or from an artery, as has been previously stated.
Or from wind constricted there.
But if it is because of a fissure of the fascia and the protrusion of fat, then its color is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain; and it appears in various locations.
And if it is because of the protrusion of the intestine, then its location, with what we have narrated, is of greater variety.
Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it is greatly magnified at the entrance of the bath, and [causes] vehement labor.
If however it is because of humidity, it is soft, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is anything added.
But if it is because of blood, then with these signs a swelling appears tending toward blackness.
If however it is because of a formed flesh: then it is a serious, large, hard swelling, and is fixed according to a single quantity.
If however it is because of flatulence, then its touch is soft. And the operation in that is, that you consider then, if the protrusion of the navel is because of the blood of an artery, or vein, or flatulence: then it is necessary that you be prohibited from its treatment.
For in that there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter in which I discussed swellings because of an artery and vein.
But if the protrusion of the navel is because of the intestine, or hernia: then it is necessary that you instruct the patient, insofar as he holds his breath, and stands standing outstretched.
Then mark with a cautery around the whole navel.
Afterwards instruct him that he lie on his back between your hands.
Then surround with a wide spatula around the navel over the place which you marked with the cautery.
Afterwards extend the middle of the abscess upwards, with a large hook.
Then tie it around firmly with thread, or with a silk cord with a firm ligature: and let the knot of the ligature be secure.
Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligature.
If therefore you find it already seized by the ligature: then pull out the ligature, and insert into it the index finger, and push the intestine to the interior of the belly: and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and incise its superfluity.
But if an artery or vein is opposed to you, then surround it much.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads: and insert the two needles into the circumference which you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then bind the abscess in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies: and falls by itself: or incise it when it becomes thin and putrefies.
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments, until it is healed.
But if the prominence of the navel is from raw flesh in it, or from moisture: then it is necessary that you hollow out the abscess, as we said.
And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Then treat it with that which solidifies the place.
Concerning the care of cancer. Chapter 53.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it: nor have I seen another before me who has succeeded in it.
And the operation in it, when it is situated as we have said, is that you should precede, and loosen the patient from black bile sometimes.
Then you should bleed him if you find him with manifest repletion.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation, in which he is situated with the operation.
Then throw hooks into the cancer which are suitable for it.
Afterwards, hollow it out from every part with the skin, according to exploration, until nothing remains of its roots; and let the blood run, and do not cut it quickly, but rather press the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever is possible there of instruments.
But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter 54.
We have already recounted in the division the types of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs: and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only a type of ascites alone: and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympanitis: nor in the case of hyposarca completely: for that is deadly.
When you have already treated this type of dropsy, tympanitis, with medicines, and your treatment has not helped: then consider.
For if the patient has already suffered weakness, or has another illness besides dropsy: such as if he has a cough, or diarrhea, and things like that: then beware lest you treat him with iron: because there is fear of that.
But if you see a patient of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone: and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is that you raise the standing patient between your hands, and a servant behind him presses his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a spiny spatula, according to this form.
Let it be of two sharp parts, long, the sharp end like a spatula.
However, let there be some shortness in it gradually, so that you do not pass with it in the operation all the way to the intestine, and injure it.
Then consider.
For if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, then it is necessary that you lengthen the incision from the navel by the amount of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubis.
But if the generation of dropsy is due to a liver ailment, then let your incision be three fingers to the left of the navel.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wants to lie, so that superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Then perforate the whole skin with an instrument.
Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with a spatula between the skin and the fat, as if you are flaying it: and let the amount that is flayed be the amount of a fingernail, or thereabouts.
Then perforate the fat, until the spatula reaches the empty place: and that is the place of the water.
Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument, of which this is the form.
And it is similar to a tube: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: which in its lower part has a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other: and its end is incised, according to the manner of the incision of a reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a moderate quantity.
Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps the sick man dies through the resolution of his animal spirit: or syncope occurs to him which approaches death.
Truly evacuate from it according to the quantity of its strength, and according to what the conditions of the sick man signify to you from the strength of his pulse, and from the goodness of it.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Which is because it is immediately retained because of the skin which retains the hole which is upon the siphon: of which I have narrated, that you should perforate it according to that method.
Then repeat the instrument on the following day, if you see the sick man tolerate it: and also draw out from the water a small quantity. Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains of the water only a little.
But if you are afraid for the patient, and leave a large amount of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and let him suffer thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize upon the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water: according to what I have narrated in what precedes.
Concerning the care of infants who are born with their urinary places not perforated.
Chapter 55. When an infant exits from the womb of its mother, and the opening of its penis is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or not in its proper place.
Therefore it is necessary to help with its perforation immediately upon birth with a very fine spatula, according to this form.
Then place a fine lead nail in the opening and bind it: and keep it there for three or four days.
When, therefore, he wishes to urinate, let it be removed, and he will urinate.
Then replace it.
And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine flowing over the place will not allow it to close.
But he whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
Those, however, in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are injured.
That is because in those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis; wherefore he cannot urinate forwards, until he lifts his penis upwards with his hand. Nor is there generation for him, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it is a very foul illness.
And the method of operation in this case is that the patient is laid on his back.
Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a strong extension, and incise the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a lancet, or a sharp spatula: just as you would make an incision in a reed, or as you would shave something, so that the middle of it becomes similar to the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle as is necessary.
And beware in your operation of a flow of blood.
For that often happens.
Therefore apply to it that which stops blood, and treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning what happens to the prepuce and the head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter 56.
These things often happen in the penis, and it is a protrusion of foul flesh.
And of it, some is malignant, and some is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a thin hook, and you should cut it away until you cleanse it entirely.
Then place over it a pledget soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterwards with diafinicon ointment until it heals.
But if the Albucasis is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after its incision and shaving.
But if the Albucasis is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and part of the Albucasis is between the foreskin, and part of it outside: then it is necessary to remove the Albucasis which is inside first, until when it consolidates, then treat it externally: because when you treat it together, the foreskin is not secured from being perforated.
And now blackness and corruption also happen in the testicles and foreskin.
Therefore, it is necessary that you hollow out everything that is already blackened, and that wants to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Then spread over it afterwards with honey which is already mixed with the flour of pomegranate rinds, and of crushed and sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
But if a flow of blood happens, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For a cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, namely for a flow of blood, and a wound when it is corrupted.
But if the head of the penis is corroded, and the whole thing is destroyed at once: then it is necessary that you insert into the passage of the penis a small lead tube, so that the sick man may urinate over it.
However, in the adhesion of the foreskin with the head of the penis, and this adhesion indeed does not happen except in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon it: and sometimes adhesion happens because of a wound, or an abscess: therefore it is necessary that you scrape it with a blunt spatula, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
But if it is difficult to distinguish them exquisitely, then it is necessary that you scrape something from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin.
That is because when the foreskin is thin, perhaps it is pierced because of its thinness quickly.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine, until it is healed. Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the cure of accidents happening to them.
Chapter 57.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; nevertheless, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we indicate in it a better operation, and a more gentle way leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
That is, because I have found the majority of surgeons and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor, and with scissors; and they use cautery, and binding with thread, and incision with a fingernail.
And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and I have found none better than cleansing with scissors and binding with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower layer remains; therefore it is forced to be incised to cut the other, and future pain.
And with the cleansing which is done by cautery, that is, a finger-like instrument which sewers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not secured: because perhaps it enters its hole.
Moreover, in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron escapes, and spoils your operation: and indeed a child's skin is short by nature, and often they are born such that they do not need cleansing: and I have already seen that.
However, cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread revealed a good experiment to me: because scissors are proportional in incision: therefore, because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Therefore, when you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation in one time: and a compression is made with a similar figure, containing the skin of the penis from every side, with which no error falls at all.
And the proper method of operation is that you cause to be known, a boy especially, if he is among those who understand a little, that you do not do, except that you tie a thread only on his penis: and you leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that is possible for you, from that which his intelligence receives.
Then insert your hand to his penis, and inflate the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it from the filth that collects in it.
Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Afterwards, tie a second ligature a little lower. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature with a good grip, and incise between the two ligatures.
Then quickly lift the skin upwards, and pull out the head of the rod.
Then allow the blood to flow gradually (for this is better) and place powder on top: and over the powder a cloth in which the yolk of a hard-boiled egg has been spread, beaten with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on until the next day: and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Now the shape of the scissors for cleaning is this.
Let the two ends be blunt, and let them be meeting: lest a nail-like projection extend from them: and let the length of the two sharpened parts be equal to the length of the two handles.
The error that occurs in cleaning is: because perhaps the whole inner skin escapes, or part of it at the incision. Therefore it is necessary that you extend it from your hour with your nail before the suppuration of the place: and incise it evenly.
But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then draw it out with a hook, and incise it.
But if three days pass, and what is under the rod remains swollen, suppurated: then leave it until the warm abscess settles, and flay it easily, and incise it as it is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod.
For that will not harm it.
Therefore treat it with that which consolidates a wound from the powders which we have described in the treatise on powders: and if it is incised from the skin beyond measure, and extends to the upper parts, that also will not harm it.
Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of urine retained in the bladder.
Chapter 58.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growth of flesh, and similar things to those which we have mentioned in the divisions of treatment.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is now in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that the patient be bent over on his knees.
Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the patient hold his breath as much as possible.
Therefore, the neck of the bladder is compressed to expel the stone backwards: wherefore the urine is released.
But if it is not released by what we have said, and the matter is urgent for the patient: then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave like the quill of a bird's feather in the thinness of a ray, long in the likeness of one and a half palms: to which there is a slender tube at its head.
And the method of exit of urine by it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie wool or cotton to its extremity, with a good ligature: and introduce the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if anything of the wool is superfluous, but introduce it into the tube forcefully, like an auger.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white: and make the patient sit on a seat, and moisten the bladder and its neck with wet oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then introduce the syringe into the neck easily, until it reaches the root of the neck.
Then bend it upwards from the part of the navel. Then push the syringe inside it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has already reached the empty thing: and this is not done in this order, except because the passage, into which it goes, is tortuous.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
For the urine will follow the wool.
Then draw it out, and make the urine run through the urinary passage: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease doing that, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief. Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
For it is deaf, that is, closed.
And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see.
And the concave space, in which is that which impels, should be according to the quantity which fills it without addition, until when something is drawn with it, the humors are drawn out: and when it is impelled, it is expelled to a distance: according to what the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is thrown in the battles of Mars.
Therefore, when you wish to throw humidities into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the humidity, and draw with that which impels to the higher parts, for the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then insert its end into the tube, as we have narrated in the syringe.
Then impel the humidity with that which impels it; for that humidity arrives at the bladder immediately, so that the infirm person feels it. The form of a slender clyster by which the bladder is clysterized.
Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they are rolled up. Then gather the circle, as the alsofratu is gathered: after you put into it what you wish of humidities, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the humidity reaches the bladder.
Concerning the extraction of a stone.
Chapter LX. We have already spoken in the division of the kinds of stone, and its cure with medicines: and I have spoken of the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of the whole: and I have spoken of the stone in which operation with the hand and incision falls: and it is a stone generated in the bladder properly: and that which is fixed in the urethra: and I am narrating that with manifest exposition and abbreviation.
Therefore I say that a stone generated in the bladder happens most to boys.
And among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety: and white sand appears in it, and the sick person rubs his penis, and labors with it, and often it hangs down. Then it is raised, and the anus comes out with it in many of them.
And the healing of children is easy, until they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in old men.
But in young men it is moderate, in that which is between that: and the one whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if small, the care of it is the opposite.
Therefore, when we come to the cure, it is necessary first that we cleanse the patient with a clyster, which draws out all the excrement that is in his intestines; for it sometimes prevents the finding of the stone on examination. Then let the patient be taken with his feet up, and shaken, and moved downwards: that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or rise from a high place sometimes.
Then make him sit between your prepared hands, and let his hands be under his hips, so that the whole bladder may slope downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel the stone in the space, then hasten immediately with the incision upon it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the patient is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a grown young man: and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place where you wish to make the incision: and instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to draw up the testicles with his right hand: and with his other hand to draw back the skin which is under the testicles on the side of the place where the incision is.
Then insert the cutting instrument, whose form is this.
And make an incision in what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, but to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision is wide externally, and narrow internally, according to the amount that the exit of the stone from it may not be larger.
For perhaps the finger which is in the anus compresses the stone at the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
And know that of a stone which has angles and edges, therefore its exit is difficult on account of that.
And of that which is smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
Therefore to that which has angles and edges, add to the fissure.
Which if it does not exit thus, then it is necessary that you operate on it: or that you bind it with a suitably shaped bandage, the end of which is like the moon, which binds the stone and does not slip from it; or that you insert beneath it a slender instrument, of curved extremity.
But if you cannot operate on it, then enlarge the opening a little.
But if something of blood overcomes you, cut it away with a scalpel.
If however the stone is more than one, then first push the largest towards the opening of the bladder.
Then incise upon it.
Afterwards push the small one after it: and similarly do if there are more than two.
But if it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut upon it with a large incision.
Because one of two things happens to the patient, either that he dies, or that continuous urinary dribbling occurs to him; because the place does not completely heal.
Truly administer its expulsion, until it comes out; or cleverly break it up with forceps, until you extract it piecemeal.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloes, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place upon it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot abscess may subside.
Then lay the patient on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When therefore you loosen it, moisten the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with diachylon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs in the wound, and corrosions, and things like that: such as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prevented from it: and this is known from the discharge of blood with urine.
Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and draw out that blood.
For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply to every kind with that which is suitable from treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the hours of the whole treatment, that you bind the two hips together, and bring them together, because of the medicines which are placed on the place.
But if the stone is small, and is in the passage of the penis, and is fixed in it, and the exit of urine is prevented: then treat it with what I relate before you arrive at incision.
For many times you are excused from incision by this treatment, for I have already proved it. And it is, that you take a perforator of tempered iron, of which this is the form, of a triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie with it the penis under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the perforating iron into the penis easily, until the perforator arrives at the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand in the stone gradually: and attempt its perforation, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
For the urine is immediately discharged.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the penis.
For it is broken, and comes out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something which prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures.
Then extract it.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and clean the congealed blood which is in the wound.
And the ligature of the thread under the stone is not necessary, except so that it does not return to the bladder: and the other ligature above, except so that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and because of that it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, that you raise the skin upwards, so that it returns to its place at your completion, and covers the wound, as we said.
Concerning the extraction of a woman's stone.
Chapter 61.
A stone is rarely generated in women.
But if a stone should happen to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is forbidden because of many ways.
One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin. And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will uncover herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or has a husband.
Thirdly, because you do not find a woman well-skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that there is fear.
But if necessity compels to that, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-skilled: and few are found.
If however you lack that, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a midwife well-taught in women's matters, or a woman who understands some part of this art: therefore make her present, and especially instruct her, so that she does everything that you instruct her in examining the stone. First, that is, to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
If therefore she finds it, let her compress it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the sick woman, and investigate concerning the stone, after she places her left hand upon the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with the greatest of her strength, until she arrives with it at the root of the hip.
Then let her cut upon it at the midpoint of the vulva at the root of the hip, on whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and let her finger not be removed from the stone, compressing under it: and let the incision be small at first.
Then let her insert a probe into that incision.
If therefore she feels the stone, then let her add to the incision according to a proportionate amount so that the stone exits from it.
And know that the kinds of stones are many. For among these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Know therefore its kinds, so that it may be signified to you by this concerning that which you wish.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in the place pounded alum, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stanched.
But if the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which has been incised: then place powder on the place, and bind it with a suitable bandage: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
Therefore, when the sharpness of the blood has subsided after days, and the place has become putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone comes out.
Concerning the incision for watery hernia.
Chapter 62.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white sheath that is under the skin containing the testicle; and it is called a sheath. And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it is considered: which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sheath, which we mentioned; and this does not happen except rarely.
And the generation indeed of this hernia is from weakness which happens to the testicles; wherefore this matter is poured out to them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For either its color inclines to yellow, or it is red like blood, or fecal, black, or watery white, and that is what is most common.
For if it is in the white sifac which we have mentioned, then the abscess is roundish in length, somewhat like the shape of an egg; and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
And if the moisture is in its own tunic, then the abscess is round with a part of an egg, and therefore a man thinks that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the sense.
When therefore you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, whose form preceded.
According to that therefore which comes out in the track of the inserted [instrument], judge concerning that which is between it.
When therefore we come to cure with iron, then it is necessary that you order the sick man, that he be bled if that is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then let him be laid on his back on something a little high, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit you on his left, and order the assistant, that he sit on his right, who extends his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the mirach of the belly.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle lengthwise, even near the comb: and let the incision be made according to the straightness of a line equidistant which divides the skin of the testicles, until it arrives at the white sifac which contains [the testicle]: and flay it and observe, or beware of this, that you cut it: and let your flaying by which you flay it, be from the part which hangs with the egg more: and subtly search with the flaying according to the quantity which is possible for you.
Then pierce the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water. Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upwards, and do not touch the skin containing the testicles: and incise the sifac however it is possible for you to incise it, either with its totality, or piecemeal, especially its thin side.
For if you do not exquisitely search, in its incision there is no security, lest the water return.
But if the egg proceeds outwardly from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the sifac, reduce it.
Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
But if you find the egg corrupted by blackness or something else, then it is necessary that you ligate the vessels which are the suspensory, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut away the testicle with the suspensory, and remove the egg; afterwards treat it with what we have said.
But if water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part as you did the other equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it: then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool submerged in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside other wool which you have submerged in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the scrotum: and place on top folded cloths, and they are cushions: and bind them on top with a bandage which is six fingers wide according to this form.
Then take two cloths, and sew them, and fill them with carded wool, according to this likeness: and make ends by which it is pressed with tow, or wet wool: and fasten them with a bandage in the lumbar region of the breeches: and one end goes over the anus to the back, and the second goes to the part of the groin: and two ends below over the two hips, and two other ends over the two groins, and the whole bandage is fastened in the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this fistula is treated surgically with cautery at the site of the incision with iron: and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have related: until when white pus containing water is revealed: then take a cautery, according to this form.
It is similar to the Greek letter.
Then perforate that pus with it, and it is heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Then extend the pus with hooks, and scrape it with a thin, heated cautery, and incise it as much as possible, until you eradicate all of it.
And beware of the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
But if a hot abscess, or blood flow, or something else opposes you during the incision, or during the cauterization, then you must treat what opposes you with the treatment that suits it, as was previously stated.
If, however, the patient is timid and does not await this operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I relate it: and it is.
When it is confirmed to you by what we have said about the signs that the abscess is watery, then you must make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula; and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place a pledget over the place, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water may run out; then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is opposition to the flow of water at the time when you perforate it, and this is only because a white membrane opposes the opening of the wound and prevents the exit of water, then you must insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of dropsical patients is extracted, whose form precedes; or add a little to the operation of the wound.
And know that the water returns and gathers after six months, or thereabouts.
When therefore it gathers, then let it be perforated in the same way, and the sick person will pass his days.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy fistulas.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the incision upon this fistula, there is fear leading to destruction in many conditions.
Therefore, it seems to me that its leaving is to be saved from it.
And I am remembering the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Therefore I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and this happens from many causes, namely. Or from an excess of something sharp or acrid which is poured out to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it happens from a knotting and inflation of the arteries, as its mention has already preceded: or from an inflation of the veins.
Therefore, that which is from them from the inflation of the arteries is known by the disposition of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
And it is not necessary that you touch it completely.
That however which happens from the inflation of the veins, nothing is dispersed from it upon compression with the fingers. And now it is possible that a section is made upon this kind and upon the remaining flesh: and it is, that you cut the skin of the testicles.
Then extend the egg upwards, and extract it with the white sifach: and free the suspensory ligament from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and incise the suspensory ligament after you free it from every part of the parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those innate fleshes, then it is necessary that you draw out the egg, and incise it. And if there is adhesion between something of the siphak, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion, and incise it with a round incision.
But if there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you incise all of it, and extract the egg, as we said. Therefore, when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine: then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of ramic, which is with vitex.
Chapter LXIV.
A vitex is a swelling wrapped in a certain wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles: and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the sick person.
And in the treatment of this illness, there is fear, because of the recollection of what preceded it.
Truly it is necessary that we speak of the operation in it according to what the first ones did. I say therefore, that it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Then incise with a broad, sharp spatula with a transverse incision in the direction of the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then flay from every side, as we told you in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract what is collected from foul, corrupt humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which pus is generated, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle may fall away.
For there is no harm through it.
But if a vein happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed with the vessels on account of this: lest the egg be deprived of nourishment, because of the incision, and waste away, or dry up, and there be no help with them.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal fistula. Chapter 65.
Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from the sifach, or its extension.
And these two types happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy thing, and similar things.
And the sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach.
It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an equal abscess towards the depth: therefore, because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And its sign when it is from the section of the sifach, because it causes a vehement pain to happen suddenly from its beginning: and it is a diverse abscess, appearing under the nearby skin: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
And sometimes the zirbum exits with the intestine: and this is named intestinal Ramex, and zirbia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes the feces run into the intestine, and are retained there: and with it is the destruction of the infirm; because it causes a bad pain to happen, and especially when it is pressed.
And in the cure of the species of this illness with iron there is fear: wherefore it is necessary that the case be avoided in it.
And the method of operation is, that you order the infirm, that he reduce the intestine with his hand to the interior of his concavity, if he obeys the return.
Then he is to be laid supine upon his neck between your hands: and raise his legs.
Then extend the skin which follows the skin to the higher parts, and cut the whole skin of the testicles lengthwise.
Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and let the incision be of such a size that, if possible, the egg may come out of it.
Then flay the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until, when the white siphak is uncovered, hard on every side: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the second siphak, and absolutely loosen with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Then move with your right hand to the inside the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white siphak upwards, with your left hand: and lift the egg with the siphak to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards: and you loosen the adhesion which is behind, the solution being complete.
And search with your fingers, so that there may be nothing there of the intestine involved in the hard white siphak.
But if you find anything of it: then push it down to the belly below.
Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made a ligature from ten threads: and insert it near the last siphak, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Then arrange some of them over some in a way that is in the manner of a cross: and tie with them the alsifach, of which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong ligature, until nothing from the vessels which nourish them can send anything to them: so that a hot abscess may not happen from this.
And put another ligature again outside the first ligature, less than two fingers distant from it.
And after these two ligatures leave from the siphak, which is under the skin of the testicles, an amount the size of a finger: and incise all the rest according to its roundness, and remove the testicle from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles an incision, from which blood and pus flows: as we have related in what has been said before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound: and apply the ligature which we have described.
And sometimes the white siphak which we have mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing the flow of blood.
For this often happens.
And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be moistened with warm water: and place upon it that which we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Concerning a cupping instrument with a spout.
Chapter 66.
In this cupping instrument I have not seen anyone who dared to operate on it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is made as we have narrated in the cupping instrument which is with a tube.
That is, to tie off the vessels after cutting upon it with ease below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with what opens it, until the vessels fall away; and treat the wound, according to what we have said, until it heals.
Concerning the rupture which occurs in the groins.
Chapter 67.
When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is a little, and returns at all hours: truly if time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
And this happens from the stretching of the sifach, which is in the groins, as we have said.
That is, because the sifach is stretched: then it softens, and the place is inflamed, and protrudes.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its account preceded.
And sometimes it is treated with iron, according to this method: and it is that the sick man lies on his back between your hands.
Then cut the place of the rupture of the abscesses and protrusion, with a cut across, to the amount of three fingers.
Then compress the alsifak and what are under the skin, until when the white sifach is uncovered, which is under the skin which follows it.
Then take a ray, and put it on the place protruding from the sifach, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two prominent places on the end of the ray from the sifach, and connect one of them with the other with a suture; then withdraw the end of the ray.
And do not cut the alsifach completely, nor pull the egg, nor anything else, as I made you know in the treatment of intestinal rami. Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Therefore, when you cut the threads, cleanse it and restore the wound until it heals.
For the sisach is contracted, and no prominence is added to the rupture.
And cautery is better in this place: because it is closer to health.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, on account of which the flesh which is between them is softened, and its appearance is made foul.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked in its cure, that he make the sick man lie on his back, and incise all the skin which is softened upon the natural skin. Then he shall bring together the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, sew first the superfluity of the softened skin with three sutures, or four, and make the suture firm.
Then treat it with the treatment of the other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
Concerning Castration.
Chapter LXIX.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law: and because of that it would be permitted for me not to mention it in this my book: and its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when he is questioned about it: and that he may know the treatment of him to whom it happens.
And the other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit thereby, such as rams, he-goats, and cats, and similar animals.
I say therefore that castration is done in two ways. Or by attrition.
Or by fissure and incision.
Now in that which is done by attrition, the way of operation is that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are broken down and do not appear to the touch.
But in castration by fissure and incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition; because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires coitus.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite of two kinds.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite from males is according to two methods.
One of them is that which appears in that which follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a figure like the vulva of a woman, in which there is hair: and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one kind, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubic bone like very small male testicles, protruding outwardly: of which one is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of the three kinds, two from males, and one kind from females, is: because it is necessary that you cut away the added flesh, until the impression of them disappears.
Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second kind of men, however, from which urine emerges, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
Concerning the incision of the frenulum and the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
Chapter LXXI.
The frenulum is perhaps added to the natural thing, until it is defiled and its appearance becomes foul; and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it is spread out like in men, and reaches even to coition.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold the excess of the frenulum with the hand, or with a hook, and incise it; and do not go too far in the incision, especially in the depth of the root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
The flesh, however, which arises, is flesh which is born in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it goes out to the exterior according to the likeness of a tail; and because of this some first call the sickness a tailed sickness.
Therefore it is necessary that we incise it just as we incise the frenulum, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the Alratica, which is the imperforate vulva of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, as it were, the imperforate vulva of a woman, or it is a small opening.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from a preceding illness: and indeed it is made either from added, newly grown flesh, or from a thin membrane, or a thick one: and it happens either in the depth of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part: and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps prevents menstruation.
And its recognition is by the midwife's inspection, if the obstruction is apparently nearby.
But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is from a thin membrane, and is near the two labia: then hasten, and break it.
And it is so that you place pledgets on the two labia.
Then place the index fingers of your two hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread.
Then spread the two labia forcefully until the thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman cohabit every day, so that the place does not heal in another way.
But if the membrane is thick, then it is necessary that you cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is formed from flesh, then suspend it with hooks and incise it: and have with you medicines which stanch the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not heal quickly, keep it in place for several days: and administer a pledget of dry linen, then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it heals.
And sometimes other fleshy growths are born in the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be incised in this manner: provided it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess which is in the womb should on no account be treated with iron.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor rubeae in the vulvas of women.
Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the orifices of veins, until much blood flows from them constantly.
When therefore hemorrhoids become old, they become thelil: and I have already described in the division their species, and their signs: and I shall here say which of them receive treatment, and which not.
I say therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the sense: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
But those of them which are in the orifice of the womb upon which sensation falls, are those which are treated.
It is necessary therefore that you introduce the woman into a cold house.
Then extend the thelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then pulverize upon them at the flow of blood from one of the incisive powders without biting: such as acacia, and dragon’s blood, and frankincense, and similar things to them.
Then let him push her feet against the wall for one hour.
Afterwards, place her in cold water.
But if the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it upon her back.
If therefore blood is cut off with it, it is good: and if not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts, without scarification.
Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarthith, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the branches of alaulat, that is, aglanter, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the place.
When therefore the abscess is quiet, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth however is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
It is necessary therefore that you incise what appears of it, according to what I said in thelil equally: and treat it, until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of the exit which happens in the womb.
Chapter LXXIV.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and hot abscess.
And I indeed already have spoken of all these illnesses and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I speak in this treatise of the hot abscess which occurs in the womb, when it is of the abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is done with iron.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it redden: if sensation falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps with maturation, until when the acuteness of the symptoms ceases.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat which slopes two seats, and she reclines, or is laid down upon her back, and draws her feet to the lower part of her belly: and let her hips be spread, and she places her arms under her knees, and ties each with a suitable ligature to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the womb is opened.
Whose form comes in those which are after.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix it with a measure of the depth of the woman's womb: so that that which enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and harms the weak woman.
But if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions on the covering of the depth of the womb: so that the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb may be prevented: and it is necessary that he places the handle, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that he holds the instrument, and that the attendant revolves the handle, until the depth of the womb is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by hand, and is soft and smooth: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a pledget submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some styptic quality: and place the pledget, and draw out the section in the depth of the womb.
And place externally over the womb, and over the pubis, clean wool submerged in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Then let it be treated after two days with an ointment which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is clysterized with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily, or long birthwort has been boiled: then it returns to the ointment.
But if the wound is hidden internally in the womb, then it is necessary that you abstain from its treatment with iron, indeed treat it with that which we have said in the division.
The teachings of obstetricians, how live embryos, having emerged in a non-natural form, are treated.
Chapter 77.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first the form of a natural birth.
Therefore, among its signs is that when you see a woman compressed downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and that which is upon her of the birth is lightened, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is head first, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel. Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
But that which is besides this birth is unnatural, blameworthy.
Because sometimes the fetus exits on its feet, and its body exits before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and its hands exit: or its belly exits: and perhaps it is turned upon its neck, and similar blameworthy forms.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, skillful in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form of them, and what its nature is, and is signified by it, and is to be relied upon.
When the fetus exits head first in its natural manner, and this is strenuous for the woman, and the birth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then have her sit on a seat, or have women support her: and fumigate her vulva with a decoction of fenugreek, and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and break the secundines with it, and cut it with her nail, until that which is in it of moisture flows: and press the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman must be given a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then instruct her after the clyster to bear down; and make her sneeze with conserve, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
For the fetus will exit immediately.
But if two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary to reduce them gently little by little.
But if she does not obey in entry, then place the woman on a seat and raise her feet upwards; then shake the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remainder of the fetus; and tie its hand with a cloth and pull it out evenly; for then it will come out.
The exit of the embryo on its feet.
When the fetus comes out on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then to turn the fetus little by little; afterwards to straighten it.
Then let him take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When therefore they come out as far as the hips, then instruct her that she be compressed, and make her sneeze with sneezing powders; for it will come out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out with what we have narrated, then return the fetus gradually until you place it according to its natural form.
For then it will come out easily.
But if it is prevented with all that we have narrated, then take some marshmallow mucilage and sesame oil and dissolved gum: and pound all together in a mortar with a good pounding; then smear the woman's vulva and the lower part of her belly with it.
Then make her sit in warm water until it reaches her hypochondria.
Therefore, when you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her a pessary of myrrh and apply it.
When therefore the pessary has remained for an hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Then make her sneeze; and hold her mouth and nose; and press the lower part of her belly with gentle pressure.
For the fetus will come out immediately.
The exit of the fetus is over the knees and hands.
When it comes out in this way, then he will succeed in inserting his hands gradually.
Then the woman will be laid back on her neck, and her feet will hang downwards; and she will be lying on the bed, and will clasp her hands.
Then press gradually on her belly.
Then remove what is under her feet from the cushions, until she is prepared in the lower part.
But if the fetus does not come out, then take its feet and move them with a strong movement.
Then press what is above the hypochondria gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Then let him insert his hands and gradually straighten the fetus; and instruct the woman to bear down until the fetus comes out.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Skill is required in the reduction of its hand.
But if he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
But if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed and shake her legs with a strong shaking.
Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.
But if labor seizes her, then make her sit on a seat.
Then strive to reduce the hand, and adjust the fetus according to its natural form, and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to strain herself until it comes out.
The exit of the fetus is over its neck, with its hands outstretched, and its face is towards its mother's back.
The midwife ought to hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually rotate it, and adjust it easily.
When therefore it is adjusted, then place on her vulva that which we have described of oil and mucilages.
Then instruct her to move gradually.
When therefore you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to lean to her right side.
Then instruct her to bear down; and make her sneeze with sneezing powders.
The exit of the prepared fetus on the side.
When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then tear the afterbirth with your nail, until it is emptied of moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it may not be retained, and die.
Then push the fetus inwards, until you place it as is proper; and instruct the woman to bear down several times: for it will then exit easily.
The exit of twins, or of many fetuses.
Know that twins are often born; and sometimes three, and four are born.
However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Five, however, is unnatural, and they do not live at all: and a single secundine contains them, however many they may be; and they are separated by the sifach, distinguishing between them, attached to the umbilicus of each.
And sometimes they come out as a single fetus does through a natural, easy exit; and they come out through a blameworthy exit, as we have narrated. But if some of them are difficult at birth, and arrive at what we have spoken of as unnatural presentations, then treat them as we have narrated: and let there be a skilled midwife, and let her act with speed and slowness, and let her contrive according to every presentation with what is prepared for her from a skill leading to health.
Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has been verified by me that a woman aborting emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore all this ought to be in the knowledge of midwives. For perhaps a similar thing will come to her: therefore let her oppose it with what is necessary.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have mentioned in the division of medications, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with the hand, then it is necessary that you consider.
If therefore the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted with any of the accidents from which loss is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid supine on the bed, on her back, and her head be inclined lower, and her legs raised: and a helper should hold her on both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body is not pulled during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils with marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed. Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages: then let her insert it into the womb with ease.
Then let her seek with it the place in which to fix hooks on the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend headfirst: then fix hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its clavicle, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is on its feet, then in its pubis and middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place its curve in what is between the fingers of her left hand: and insert it with her hand easily, and fix the hook in some of those places which we have mentioned, until she reaches the empty space.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not be only according to straightness, but rather let it be moved in every direction, so that its exit is eased: just as is done with a tooth at its extraction.
And it is necessary that what is between them be softened for the extension.
But if a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so that she may revolve with them what is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then let the hooks be changed to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
If therefore a hand comes out before the others, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Then pull it out until, when it comes out entirely, you incise it either at the joint of the sole or at the elbow; and thus you must do in the other hand and in the two feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or a constriction happens to it in its exit, or water is gathered in its head, then it is necessary that he insert a thorny spatula between the fingers, and split the head with it, and extract the water; or break it up with the instrument which is called Almisdac: the form of which comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is after this.
Similarly, if the fetus is by nature of a large head, then it is necessary that you cut it with algengematu; or extract it with misdach, as we have said.
Then pull out the bones with forceps.
If the head comes out and is constricted at the clavicle, then let it be split until the moisture which is in the chest is poured out.
But if it is not entangled, nor obeys the exit, then incise the head piecemeal, according to what is possible for you.
But if there is an abscess in the lower part of the belly, or if there is dropsy in it, then it is necessary that you perforate it until the moisture runs out of it.
If however the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is light.
But if it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and split the belly or chest until that which is in them runs out.
But if the remaining limbs are removed, and the head remains, then let the midwife insert her left hand. Therefore if the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert her hand into the depth of the womb, and let her seek the head with it, and draw it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb: then let her insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it with them.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, because of a hot abscess which happens to it, then it is not necessary that labor be undertaken upon it, but rather it is necessary then to administer the effusion of humid, fatty things: and administer plasters: and let her sit in waters which soften and moisten.
But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it be straightened: then let that which we said concerning a live fetus be administered.
But if that is not possible, then let it be cut piecemeal, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then administer what we said concerning hot abscesses which happen in the wombs.
But if a flow of blood happens, then let her descend into astringent waters, and administer the remaining treatment.
And I indeed already saw a woman, in whose belly a fetus had died; then she was impregnated upon it a second time, afterward another fetus also died.
Therefore, after a long time an abscess happened to her in her navel, and it swelled until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Therefore I was called to her cure, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound was not consolidated.
Therefore I placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction: and a bone came out from the place.
Then several days passed for her, and another bone came out.
Therefore I was amazed at this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Therefore I examined the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition: and she now lived thus for a long time, and emitted a little pus from the place.
And I did not confirm this unusual thing here, except because there is knowledge in it, and help for that which the skilled physician administers with the hand in treatment.
Concerning the forms of instruments necessary in the extraction of a fetus.
Chapter 77.
Here below is the form of the constrictor, by which books are bound, which has two equally sized whorls at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
However, this whorl ought to be more slender than the constrictor; and it should be made either of ebony or of boxwood.
And let the width of each piece of wood be about two fingers; and the margin of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed in both, whose length is half a palm and a little more or less; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more or less.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it is opened with them when you revolve the two whorls.
The form of the whorl by which the matrix is opened.
Another form similar to that one, more slender and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Therefore when you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her legs hanging down, and what is between her legs open.
Then insert these two joined additions into the matrix: and you are holding the extremity of the instrument below between her hips.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount you wish of the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
The shape of another kind of turning which the ancients called the impelling shape by which the fetus is impelled.
The shape of the Almisdac with which a small head is crushed. The shape of a hook having one point.
The shape of a hook having two points.
The shape of forceps which has saw teeth, with which the head of the fetus is crushed.
The shape of a spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
The shape of two broad spatulas also.
All these instruments are practiced, and the more their kinds are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker he is at his work, and the more highly regarded among men, because of their quantity.
Therefore do not despise any of these instruments, but let them be prepared for you.
For their necessity is inexcusable.
Concerning the extraction of the secundine.
Chapter LXXVIII.
When the secundine is retained after childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the weak woman to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils.
If therefore it exits by this means, it is good.
If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid; and put into it herbs which open the mouth of the womb, such as calamus, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and savin, and cassia lignea, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and put them over the fire.
Then place a reed tube over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end into the mouth of the womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said.
For the afterbirth will come out easily.
But if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage. Then let her insert it into the vulva, and search for the afterbirth with it.
When therefore she has found it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
But if it is attached deep in the womb, then let her insert her hand, as we have described, until when she has found the afterbirth, and extract it gradually according to its straightness, so that the womb does not fall during forceful pulling: rather it is necessary that it be moved easily to the right and left sides: then let the amount of pulling be increased.
For then it obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with medication from the pot with herbs.
But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you tire yourself in repeated extraction.
Truly it is necessary that what comes out to the mouth of the womb from it, be tied to the woman's hip.
Then give her a clyster with tetrapharmacon ointment.
For it will putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve, and it will come out.
However, when it putrefies, an evil odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak woman.
Therefore, suitable fumigations ought to be administered to it.
Certain of the ancients, however, have already tested a fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated in the retention of afterbirth and menses.
Let it be made from a glass similar to an alcama, or from brass: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed upon the coals: let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus.
Chapter 79.
Many boys are born, and their anuses are imperforate, which a subtle membrane has already obstructed.
Therefore it is necessary that the midwife perforate that membrane with her finger; and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp spatula; and let her beware of the rectum, lest she touch it.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil upon it.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wishes to defecate.
And now there happens an obstruction of the anus also from the healing of a wound, or an abscess.
Therefore it is necessary that that consolidation be cut, then treated with what we have said of treatment and lead. Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Chapter LXXX.
Fistulas which occur in the lower part, are a knotting, and a thickening which occur near the anus externally: or in the space of one part: and it is one fistula, or more.
When therefore that knotting becomes old, it opens, and a watery white moisture, or thin pus, flows from it.
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
And some of these fistulas, when they are in the space, penetrate as far as the bladder, and as far as the urinary passage.
And some of them penetrate as far as the hip joint and as far as the coccyx.
However, what distinguishes a fistula penetrating to the anus from one that does not is that you insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe into the fistula made of air or iron, when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert a thin lead probe into it, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
But if you do not feel it completely, nor does anything come out of the opening from excretion, nor flatulence, nor a worm as I said, then know that it is not penetrating; therefore hasten to the cure.
And when a fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary meatus, then its sign is the exit of urine from it, and the prohibition of its consolidation with medicines.
If, however, it penetrates to the hip joint or to the hip bone, then its sign is that the probe reaches there if there is no tortuosity in it to the bone; and the finding of pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus always comes out of it; and that medication does not work in it, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is absolutely no cure; and their cure is labor and vanity for the foolish physician upon whom it is formed. In that which is not penetrating, and not old, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I relate to you, and I have already proved it: and it is that the infirm person lies between your hands on his back; and you raise his legs above his hips, and his hips are inclined to his belly.
Then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
But if the infirm person feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you introduce your index finger into the anus.
Therefore if you feel the probe has already penetrated by itself in your finger, besides what you feel between your finger and the fistula or flesh: then therefore you know certainly that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor in it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
However, it has been said that in some men the flesh heals, and of the medication by which help is hoped for it, is to heat a fine cautery according to the size of the fistula, as preceded, and to introduce it burning into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Then repeat it twice or three times, until you know that all those added, filtered fleshes which are similar to the quill of a bird's feather are now cauterized.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, until those cauterized fleshes come out: then treat it with ointments which generate and consolidate flesh.
If therefore it heals, it is good.
And if not, then it is never healed with another treatment.
And if a probe emerges, and does not reach to your finger which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick covering of flesh or fat, and you see a fistula in what follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the probe which is in the fistula, until the cutting reaches where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe is freed and falls.
Then cleanse those filtered fleshes, which resemble the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
But if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation so that you cut those fleshes: then it is better, and of quicker help, to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Because cauterization with fire brings together good habits, the burning of those added fleshes, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying of humors.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, or with crushed cabbage leaves, until the place emits pus, and those burnt fleshes come out in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which generate hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there are stypticity and drying.
For when they are restored, then it is healed: and you do not fear a recurrence. But if the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and is extended from the superfluity of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a probe, and between you and it is a covering of fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation in that, except according to the way of trust and hope.
That is, because one of three methods is administered in it: either to cauterize it, as we said: or to cut it, until you obtain its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert lint, and treatment from nearby.
And do not proceed far with the incision, lest you cut the muscle containing the anus, and there happens to the patient an involuntary discharge of excrement. Then treat it with what we have said. For perhaps it will heal: or you will lengthen that covering, and cleanse it after you cut it almost to the anus, as we said, either with a probe, or with another instrument of sharp point.
Then cleanse those filtered tissues which are in the incision, as far as you can with exploration.
Then attempt the repair of the whole wound with a suture, and the upper opening where it is consolidated: and a fistula remains open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes a fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you introduce a probe into the fistula: and it is at the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like an aleskef needle, that is, of those preparing leather, according to this form.
And insert into it a thread twisted from five threads, and around it.
Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its depth.
If therefore it penetrates inwardly near the margin of the anus, then draw the thread out of that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and draw out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together: and tighten each, and leave it for one or two days: and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those flesh which are between the two ends of the thread are cut, and fall away: then treat the wound, until it is consolidated, and healed.
For it is not in your power to do that because of the muscle, so that you do not cut it.
Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatulite for splitting a fistula, whose curve is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Chapter LXXXI.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
For they are either within the anus, similar to bladders of coals, or plums; or as if they themselves were grape seeds.
And of these there are small ones and large ones: and blood always flows from them, and there is one, and there are many.
And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those which are outside the anus are, for the most part, deficient in moisture, from which flows a yellowish water, or a little blood with a constant flow; and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is that you should order the patient to sit; and it should be pressed out until it leaves the anus, and the athelil appear to you.
Therefore, also suspend it with hooks; or hold them with your fingernail.
Then incise them at their roots.
But if the hooks do not hold in them, because of their moisture and softening, then take them with a rough cloth, or with a pledget of woolen fabric, and pull them out with your fingers.
Then incise them, and sprinkle on them after incision some warm powders, that they may stand in place of cautery.
Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
But if the anus does not obey evacuation, then give the patient an enema in which there is a little sharpness, so that what is in the anus may be washed away with it, and obey evacuation quickly, when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their matter is light, easy: and it is that you take them with your nail, or take them with a hook, and incise them.
Then treat them with what we said, until they are healed.
And whoever abhors incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method.
Take a wound thread, and insert it into a needle.
Then draw the hemorrhoid upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be lateral: and bind the hemorrhoid with a strong constriction.
Then knot the thread, and remove the needle.
Do this with all the hemorrhoids, and leave one of them: nor bind it, that an excess of blood may flow from it.
Then place over the anus a cloth infused in rose oil, or cerate, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest.
Then leave it until it falls off.
When therefore the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments, and the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of fissures.
For they often occur from the drying of the stool and the constriction of nature.
When therefore they become old, and medicine does not work on them, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist and the upper layer which prevents them from healing is removed from them.
Then treat them until they heal as is necessary.
But if they do not heal, then repeat the procedure with more force than the first time, until they bleed a lot and are flayed; then treat them until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmar, and of dry athelil, and of formica.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
From dry athelil, however, there is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence on the surface of the body.
And they often occur on the hands of children.
And its treatment is that you extend the athelil and incise it; or bind it with a silk thread; or with hair, until it falls off.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said before with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now inverted and uninverted athelil are eradicated with the instrument which I shall describe. An ant, moreover, is also a small, filtered, thick eminence on the surface of the body, extending deeply: and when cold finds it, something like the biting of an ant is felt in it, and it occurs throughout the body; and it occurs mostly on the hands.
And its treatment is that you take a small tube from a goose quill, or a strong vulture quill; and place that small tube over the ant, until the circle of the tube contains parts of it.
Then roll your hand with the tube until you cut what is around the ant; and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root. And if you wish, do it with a tube of bronze or iron, in this manner.
Let the top of the tube be of a height drawing a rolled-up deafness, so that its grasp and its rolling on the finger may be eased.
And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was mentioned previously in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the forms of instruments which are used for clysters in the illnesses of the anus, and for the loosening of the bowels, and for colic.
Chapter 83.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast bronze, or of hammered bronze.
And sometimes it is made from these instruments, small and large, according to those in whom they are administered.
Therefore that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and of those whose anuses are weak or painful, so also their clysters.
A large clyster.
A small clyster.
Its tube, that is, the upper head in which the bladder is tied, should be wide in this manner: and it should have a distinction so that the bladder is tied as you see, and its lower extremity which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, that is, not open, very smooth, tapering to a point: and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And let the width of the opening be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker, and let the bladder in which the medicines are placed be of an animal's bladder: or of sheepskin, which should be according to the form of a small asofrat; the root of which is one palm.
Therefore, when the bladder is placed in it, let it be bound at the head of the clyster between two distinctions with a strong binding.
Then clysterize with it.
And this is the form of the bladder here depicted, and of the holes. Moreover, the quality of clysterizing with it is this: that you fill the bladder or vesicle with medicine, which is warmed according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and beware lest it be very hot, or very cold.
Then let the patient be laid on his back, and raise his legs upwards; and place under him an inthaan, that is, a hide upon which men lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or the like.
Then introduce it into the anus easily.
Then let the attendant take the bladder with both hands together, and squeeze it forcefully until he evacuates all that is in the clyster into the intestine. Then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs to the wall. If the medicine compels him to defecate, then let him retain it as much as he can.
And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more effective in helping.
But if you administer a clyster to him in cases of looseness of the bowels, and his evacuation is rapid, then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
But if there are haemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very fine, gentle, of the kind used for children.
And this is the form of a fine clyster over which the skin is tight.
Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already spoken in the division concerning the treatment of wounds which was appropriate to the book, and I shall here describe their treatment by hand and with medicines according to what is fitting.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore the things by which wounds are made are many times such as the throw of a stone: or the incision of a sword, or a knife: or a blow with a lance, or wood, or arrow: and similar things from many things.
Moreover, wounds which are made according to the places of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver: and similar members.
And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may establish a reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds.
And I shall begin with simple head wounds: because the recollection of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say.
When a simple wound happens in the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throw of a stone, or similar things, and has already broken only the skin: and it is a large wound, and you fear concerning the bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hasten, and immediately bleed the cephalic vein: and do not delay this: and draw from him blood according to the quantity of his strength: if nothing prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood which comes out of the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the patient beware of repletion, and wine, and coarse foods.
But if something prohibits bloodletting, then let him be lessened in food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And place upon the wound, if a hot abscess happens to it, a compress soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
But if you are secure from a hot abscess, then place upon the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I shall relate shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place upon it certain ointments, until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is from the incision of a sword, and the like: and its lips do not come together by means of small powders, then bring them together with a suture, according to what I shall relate in the wounds of the belly concerning their suture.
But if the wound is now laid bare from the bone, and hangs down, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspensory: then incise it.
Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in place of skin, and order the patient to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads, and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge: and similar things.
But if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then incise all the putrefied part, and throw it away: then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not cut off by medicines, then inquire about the artery.
If therefore you find it uncut, then cut it with a spatula, or tie it.
But if necessity demands when that which we have said does not help, then cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped.
Method of incarnative powder.
Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime: let the whole be well ground and sifted: and let the wound be filled with it, and bound tightly until it adheres well to it and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it over with lint, and leave it, and do not unbind it while it remains, so that it may not fester.
For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
Concerning wounds of the neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment and that of a head wound when it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is nothing to be done except to avoid treating it with something that produces strong stypticity, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Because they harm the nerves and constrict them.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most superior of the members; and let that which heals it be from mild medicines, such as lime washed with fresh water several times infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when it is also washed with fresh water; and the other mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer a suture; or draw its lips together with powders.
Then treat it until it heals.
But if the wound is deep, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus is already collecting, then perforate it in the lowest place in it.
But if an artery has been cut in the wound, and a flow of its blood has resulted, then separate or cut it, and tie it; or cauterize it, if necessity demands it.
But if the vertebrae of the throat, or the whole of it, have been injured, and the al-hawādigī have been saved, then bring together the edges of the skin with a suture over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe, but level it, and restore it to its natural shape.
Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments which have astringent and drying properties, until it is healed.
But if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then examine it; then if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all of them, or as many as you can; and what is not ready, leave it, until the wound festers, and it is separated and its discharge is lessened.
But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder which I have described.
But if bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with that whose mention came in its chapter.
Chapter LXXXVI.
Therefore if wind escapes from the wound when the sick person breathes out from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if it is not deep, and is fresh with its blood: then do not put powder on it at first, nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be retained in its depth and return to the heart, and kill the sick person; but put on it attractive ointment, and dissolve it twice a day.
But if you do not have ointment, then place old linen at the opening of the wound, so that it may absorb what comes out of it in moisture; and make the sick person sleep upon the wound so that what collects in it may flow out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wounding, and the sick person has not suffered a spasm, nor a bad tremor of the heart, nor a tightness in breathing, and you see his other conditions to be good: then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore treat it with linen cloths and the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it always opens up again, then know that a fistula has formed.
Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what has preceded concerning suture, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and fragments have fallen from it, then explore the wound and hasten to extract those fragments if they are separated.
But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for their extraction is then easier.
The judgment in the treatment of other wounds occurring in the other members is the same as that which we have described.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, and the protrusion of the intestines, and their exit.
Chapter LXXXVII.
The rupture which happens to the abdomen is great, medium, and small.
Therefore from a large one sometimes an intestine, or a number of intestines, protrudes.
Therefore their replacement and their suture is more forceful and more difficult.
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
Therefore it follows that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hasten in their replacement to their place immediately: because it is inflated, opened, and thickened: wherefore its entry becomes difficult.
Therefore on account of this, a medial rupture is better: because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two types.
Know that the suture of the abdomen is according to four methods.
Two common sutures are suitable for the suture of the abdomen, and for the suture of other wounds of the body: and two other sutures are proper to other wounds.
However, they are more proper to the suture of the abdomen: and I relate to you each one with explanation and clarification. Therefore I say, that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out of it, and it is difficult to reduce it: then that is because of one of two methods.
Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: or because there is inflation in the intestine because of the cold air.
When therefore it is so, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a cloth moistened in tepid water alone.
Or boil it in water with squill, and cyperus, and spikenard, and bathe the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does that: and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow, or marsh-mallow has been boiled.
For by that its entry is eased with a small thing.
But if its return is prevented after this treatment, then make a small incision in the rupture, with the instrument with which haemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than incision: and compulsion to cut is not done after necessity and failure of the instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part of it not sharp, and let the slender end not be with the slenderness of a spatula, but rather be somewhat blunter: and it is that which resembles a caiada, as you see.
Therefore, when the wound is widened, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own proper place, if it is possible over that: because it is better.
When however the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your intention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which is the wound be higher than the other part.
And so it is necessary that you administer that in large wounds, and in medium-sized wounds.
In small wounds however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then make so that there is present between your hands a pious minister, who holds the whole rupture with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Then uncover from it to him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the method of the common suture of one.
And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the size of the wound.
Then leave from the extremity of the rupture the quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician: and fix one needle beyond which you insert into it thread at two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of the sifac which is under the skin from the interiors, until you make it penetrate from the other part, and you have now brought together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the sifac: and four rows are made.
Then tighten with doubled thread around the needle several times from the two parts together, until the two lips of the wound are brought together with decent gathering.
Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and fix in them another needle: afterwards draw it back with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Therefore do not cease to do that with what you need of needles, until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.
And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness: because thin needles cut the flesh very quickly: and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: therefore it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in two nearby extremities of the skin very much: lest the flesh be cut quickly, and the wound be opened before its consolidation, and they not be lengthened also with the suture, lest the wound be prevented from consolidation.
Then cut off the end of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient in his sleep: and place on them small cushions of cloth on every side, which hold the ends of the needles: and leave them, until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
And this kind of suture with needles is indeed more suitable in small wounds.
Because one needle, or two, or about that many, suffice in their suture.
The second suture however is common, so that you bring together with the suture four extremities: two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the fascia at once, with a needle on which is wound thread equal in fineness and thickness.
Then when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, return the needle from the part from which you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is like the stitching of a cloth by which cloths are sewn together, and place between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the little finger.
And this suture men know.
And with this suture I sewed a wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than one palm: and there protruded from the intestines about two palms of the mid-gut, and the disruption was in the middle of the belly.
Therefore I reduced it after its intestine had stood outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Therefore the wound was consolidated in the space of about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived after that for many years, engaging in his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
And it was by a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor any medicines, were to be found.
Therefore I placed old linen on the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
But I shall describe two kinds of suture proper to the subject.
And it is that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
Therefore when the needle penetrates the skin and the muscle running along the length and breadth of the whole body: leave the end of the sifac on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inside to the outside at the other end of the mirach.
Therefore when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in this way at the same end of the mirach from the outside to the inside: and leave the end of the sifac which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate to the other end from the inside to the outside: and make it penetrate with your penetration by which you make it penetrate into the sifac at the end of the mirach which is in its part, until it penetrates the whole of it.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it together with the end which is from the sifac on the other side, and draw the needle out from the skin which it penetrated.
Then return it to that skin, and sew the end of the sifac which is on the other side with this end of the mirach: and draw it out from the skin which is on its side, and do that once, and again: and do it turn by turn, until you sew the whole outside according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is that you sew the skin like the sewing of leatherworkers who sew hides: so that you sew the sifac once from one side to one end of the skin: and that you leave it another time from another side, until you complete it.
The second kind of proper suture, which Galen mentioned.
This speech of his is narrated, so that you sew it according to the likeness with which some physicians sew, so that they bring together every part to its suitable corresponding part by nature: and apply the end of the sifac to its other end, and the end of the mirach to its other end.
And that is done according to what I tell you.
It is necessary that you fix the needle in the end of the mirach nearest to you on the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that alone: and leave the two ends of the sifac.
Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two ends of the sifac, namely on both sides.
Then turn both, also make them penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other ends of the mirach, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is the suture whose mention preceded.
This is therefore also Galen's statement.
And some have said.
The suture of the abdomen is straightened with two needles.
That is, to insert one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from that which is near you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew leathers equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suture is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.
The judgment of the medication of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
That is, because when you find a fresh wound with its blood, before the air changes it, and you reduce the intestine, and sew it, and adapt it: then place upon it incarnative powder.
But if the air has already changed the wound, then place upon it certain ointments which are present to you, until they produce pus: and the threads fall out, and the sifac and mirach consolidate.
Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it heals.
But if medicines are not present to you, then place upon it immediately, from when it begins to emit pus, old lint; and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
But if you fear that the wound communicates with the principal members in the injury, then it is necessary that you submerge soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil: and place it around the areas which are between the groins, and under the armpits.
And if it feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens) then clysterize it with astringent, black, warm wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and has become an exit penetrating to its concavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing: and that which is from the small intestine, of more difficult healing.
But the intestine which is named Jejunum, does not receive healing from a wound which happens to it at all: and that is because of its multitude, which is from veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is an intestine, and you obtain it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce intestines equally.
If however a space has passed, and it has now become green, or black: then it is necessary that you tie it with thread above the place which is blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not happen.
For in an intestine there are veins and arteries.
Then incise what is beyond that ligature, and place two ends of thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that its traction may be lightened upon you, and its extraction in the case of the intestine, and the emission of pus from the wound.
Concerning a wound which happens in the intestine.
When a rupture happens in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible that it is restored in some men: therefore, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and the wound was from the right of the stomach, and the wound was old: and a fistula was made, and excretion and flatulence came out of it.
Therefore I applied a treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until it was healed, and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the patient, that a bad accident might happen to the patient in his belly: and no bad accident happened to him from that.
And he remained in better conditions, eating and drinking, and copulating, and entered the bath, and exercised in his diets.
And now some experienced people have said that when a wound happens in the intestine, and it is small: then it is necessary that it be tied according to this method.
And it is, that you take ants with large heads.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one of those ants which have an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
When therefore it bites it, and clenches its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere, and not become loose.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease doing that with ant after ant according to the quantity of the whole wound.
Then reduce it, and sew the wound.
For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm at all happens to the patient. And now it is possible that the intestine is also tied with a fine thread: which has been wiped from the intestine of an animal, attached with it after it is put into a needle.
And it is so that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is much thinned.
Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its end.
Then insert that thread into a needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Then return it into the rupture. And this method of suture with ants and intestine is only according to a way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy except thinning, nor is its healing at all.
Concerning the treatment of  Zuchamen and fistulas.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that every wound or abscess when it becomes old and aged, and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and is not cut away: then it is universally called a fistula in whatever member it may be, and we call it Zuchamen.
And a fistula indeed is, according to the truth, a filtered, hard, white knot; with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather; and because of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And it is at certain times moist, which discharges pus.
And perhaps the moisture is split at certain times.
And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little; and it is thick, and it is thin.
And I already premised in the division, then when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer which is not healed, nor does flesh grow in it, is not that except because of one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of a deficiency of blood in the body: or because of its bad quality: or because between it and its edges there is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh: or because there is much filth and dirt: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter which is discharged from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment: or because the corruption affecting the region is a kind of pestilence, or through a property of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which the digestion of illnesses is difficult, and the healing of abscesses is delayed there by nature: or because in it there is one bone, or a number of bones.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment of fistula and zuken, which is done by the way of operation with the hand.
Know therefore, that fistula occurs in all the members of the body.
For among them are fistulas which reach to large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sifac: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the compound joints: such as the hand and foot: and among them are those which go to the proximity of a principal member, and similar things.
Therefore, whichever of these fistulas is according to this manner, is among the illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
But if there is among the fistulas one whose depth does not reach those places which I have mentioned: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and wish to arrive at the knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze, or iron, if the fistula extends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
But if there is tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of thin lead.
Because lead, with the softness of its body, is eased, and is bent around the tortuosity.
But if the fistula has many orifices, it is not possible for you to explore it with a probe.
Therefore, inject a clyster into one of its orifices.
For the moisture with which you inject it goes towards the other orifices, and runs out of them.
Then diligently inquire, in whatever way is possible for you, to know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the cavity of the fistula is far or near; or whether it is a single fistula which has many orifices, and consider all this with the utmost strength of your judgment: with your questioning, by which you question the patient, and the discovery of pain on compression with your hand on the place, and similar indications and causes incidental to an abscess.
When therefore you have considered all these things truly, then proceed to treatment with confidence: and it is that you consider then if the fistula is near, apparent, or in a safe place far from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have mentioned to you: then cut the fistula as has been previously described in my account, and remove what is within it of pus and corrupted flesh which grows in its orifice from flesh or thelul, and similar things; and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you cut it deeply as much as is possible for you.
Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply lint wrapped in sharp medicaments: and insert them into the cavity of the fistula which you have reached with the iron; do this with it several times until the sharp medicament corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula of corruption.
Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by that, then cauterize it as we have narrated.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is ascertained by you: then investigate it, and cut it as I have told you: if nothing prevents you, such as a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
If therefore bone is discovered, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Then treat it with that which causes it to grow flesh, until it is healed.
But if it is not healed, and emits pus as it did before: then know that you have not arrived at the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore investigate it a second time, and meticulously perform its scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength.
Then restore it.
If therefore it heals, it is good: and if not, then know that that corruption is in a distant depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
But if a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps which are suitable for it.
But if there are many bones, then carefully draw out all of them, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
If, however, something of the moist parts opposes you, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them, then cut those moist parts and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then put something on the wound that will cause it to rot: and leave it until what is around those bones of flesh and moist parts has rotted.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
And let the incision which you made in your operation be constricted.
Rather, if you fear, put on it a lint ball soaked in crushed sulfur with oil; or a lint ball soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
For when those moist parts rot and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction will be easier.
But if it is one large bone, like a bone of the leg or a hip bone, and things like them, and the corrupted part of it is large: then scrape it with the utmost care until the blackness and corruption are removed.
Then restore the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it entirely to the place where the corruption has reached; then treat it until it heals. And I tell you, a thing which happened to a man in his leg, that you may put it as an example and help in your work.
There was a man, young in age, about thirty years old, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause which moved upon it within the body, that is, from the interior, until the materials reached the leg, and it became an abscess with a large abscess; and there was no external cause.
Therefore, time passed with him through the error of physicians, until the abscess was opened, and much material came together with it.
And its treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulated, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus and the body's humors.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of the hand, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials which flowed from those openings in great quantity: indeed, the whole man's body was already wasted, and his color was yellow.
Therefore I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to connect with each other from all parts of the leg. Therefore I prepared, and cut above one of those openings, until I uncovered part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already eroded, and blackened, and putrid, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore I sawed what was uncovered to me, and prepared [it] from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away and sawed.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and healed: and this iteration in its operation, and section of it, was not necessary, except because of the disposition of the weakness of the patient, and the smallness of his tolerance, and my fear for him of death: because syncopes happened to him at all hours from the superabundance of evacuation.
Therefore he healed with a complete healing: and firm flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he behaved according to his dispositions: and it caused him no harm at all in walking.
But if a prominent bone in the body is already broken: then it is necessary that you saw it, according to this method: and it is: that you take a ligature, and bind it to the extremity of the prominent bone: and instruct someone, who extends it upwards: and place another ligature of wool, thicker than the first ligature. Then bind it over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards: and you uncover the flesh above the place which you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place a piece of wood, or a board, neatly under the bone below: because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be slightly above the corrupted place, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone: and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compel another sawing in its place. But if the bone is corrupted, and is not prominent, but rather a part of it is continuous with a part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in a part of it: then uncover the flesh from all parts completely.
Then place wood below.
Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued from the other part: and let the sawing be slightly longer than the corruption, according to what we said.
But if the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it is continuous on the other side.
However, if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy for it except abrasion.
But if the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand, or in the metatarsus of the foot: then the matter is very difficult.
Truly it is necessary that you investigate how the corruption appears to you.
And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever method is possible for you, and with whatever instrument is suitable for you: when it does not oppose you, a vein, or a nerve.
And know that cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their thinness, and their size, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their softness.
Therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the kind of instrument you need, when you have long study.
And the knowledge of the methods of this art, a witness to the methods of illnesses: for then you will find for yourself that which is suitable from the instruments for every infirmity.
The shape of a saw.
The shape of another saw.
The shape of another saw.
The shape of another saw.
This depicted saw shape should be properly made. Let its upper arc be made sharp from iron; and its handle from boxwood, and let it be pyramidally and properly made.
The shape of a joint rasp.
Let the head of this rasp be according to the form of the head of a star-headed nail; and let its points be according to the form of the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not suitable except to rub with it the heads of joints when they are corrupted, or a bone is large and great.
The shape of a larger rasp.
The shape of a medium rasp.
The shape of a wide rasp.
The shape of a rasp in which there is a concavity.
The shape of another, slender rasp.
The shape of another rasp with a curved end.
The shape of a small, slender, and thin rasp.
The shape of a rasp with which bones are cut.
The shape also of a large rasp.
This is similar to a saw, and the end is like a saw; it is shown in many places because of the sawing of bones.
The shape of a rasp which is suitable for rasping that which has been perforated from bones.
Its end is triangular, of sharp points.
It is made of Indian (material).
And similarly it is necessary that all things which we have spoken of be made from rasps, and incisors, and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Chapter LXXXIX.
Extremities putrefy, either from an external or internal cause.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and the treatment does not help, and you see the corruption encroaching on the limb, which nothing repels: then it is necessary that you incise that limb until you reach the extent of the corruption, so that the infirm person may be saved thereby from death, or from a harm which is greater than the loss of the limb.
And a sign that this has happened is that the limb blackens until it seems that fire has burned it, or it putrefies after the blackness, until that putrefaction is incised to where it follows that limb, and creeps into the whole body.
Therefore hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the striking of certain venomous creatures: such as a sea scorpion, and a viper, and a small wheel, and similar things.
If therefore the corruption, or blow, is in the extremity of a finger, then incise the finger, and do not give space to the corruption, so that it may proceed to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens in the hand, then incise it from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold in the forearm.
And if it invades it, then incise the arm at the elbow in its joint. But if the corruption passes through, and you see it around the elbow: then in that is the death of the sick person.
And to administer beyond that in treatment, is a matter of skill.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then incise it at one of the joints; and if it takes hold in the instep, then incise the whole foot.
But if it ascends to the knee, then incise the leg at the knee joint.
But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except letting go, and leaving the sick person to death.
And the method of incising a limb, or sawing it, is to tie a ligature below what you wish to incise, and tie another ligature above the place.
And let an assistant pull one ligature downwards; and let another assistant pull the other ligature upwards.
And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures with a broad spatula, until the whole flesh is exposed.
Then let it be incised, or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw not touch the healthy place; and there may happen to the sick person an added injury and a hot abscess.
But if there happens an internal flow of blood while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly; or place on it some powders which staunch blood.
Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded member with a bandage suitable to it, and take care of it until it is healed.
And I tell you that which happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I tell you.
Which is, because there happened in his foot a blackness, with a burning which is similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Therefore the man hastened of himself, after he saw the corruption increasing in the member with its vehemence, which he found from its pain and burning: and he cut it at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time passed for him, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand. Therefore he came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with what I put on his hand of medicines after cleansing his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to go into another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore he called me, to cut off his hand: and I did not want that, hoping from myself concerning the repulsion of that excess: and I also feared for him concerning the cutting off of his hand, death.
Because the man's strength was above the case.
After therefore he despaired of me, he returned to his own land: and it came to me concerning him, that he hastened, and cut off his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not brought this narrative, except that it may be a help concerning that which falls under the kind of this sickness: and that there may be a signification by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be acted.
Concerning the treatment of fistulas, and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
Chapter XC.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it makes a collection of pus: then it breaks, or is perforated, and that which is in it of pus goes out, and a vacant place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like a cloth which has already been thinned: and it does not arrive at the last in its corruption, nor does it press upon bone, nor upon nerve, nor upon ligament: it deserves to be named Sinus: and it is not named Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged until the corruption presses upon any of these members, then it is named Fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is that you incise all that skin as it is rolled up: and especially when it has been thinned, and made like a cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin adheres, and that ultimate corruption does not follow from it: and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster: and it is so that you consider the Sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus which is emitted from it is foul-smelling: then clysterize it with the Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, let them be gathered in a vessel: and let them be decocted over a fire until the medicine reddens: and comes to the thickness of honey.
Then take of it what is necessary for you: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the Sinus with it: and bind its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for the quantity of two hours.
Then draw it out with expression: do this for so many days, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the stench is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present to you: and it is so that you take the ash of vine wood, or ash from oak wood: and pour water upon it.
Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now washed.
But if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey, to which something of crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Or clysterize him with mixed honey and wine, because it is of the property of honey to cleanse and wash; and wine causes the Sinus to adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you do this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the Sinus is now removed: then clysterize him with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
And it is, that you take from the diafinicon plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or clysterize him with certain other medicines and ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
But if the orifice of the Sinus is constricted, into which the clyster cannula does not fit: then enlarge it slightly with iron: or place in it a linen cloth rolled up in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged.
And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring together its lips with a suture: and leave of it an amount into which a clyster may enter without addition.
And similarly if its orifice from which pus runs is elevated to the upper parts: then cut it in a lower place which is in it, so that pus may run from it downwards: because pus when constricted in the depth of the Sinus, prevents flesh from being generated in it.
But if it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus around its lower part according to what you wish: then try to prepare the member with a preparation by which pus may run from it easily according to what is prepared for you.
Try so that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take consolidative medicines which are placed on the wound, suitable to that which you wish.
And spread them on a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such a quantity that the whole Sinus may be covered.
Then cut with scissors in a straight line with the opening of the Sinus a hole, a little larger than the opening of the Sinus.
Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole: and place it over it at a distance from the opening of the Sinus, so that the exit of pus from it may be eased: and do not remove the large cloth, except after some days at one time.
But the one which is over the opening of the Sinus, is the one which you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from pus may come out: and so that you may know whether that which flows from it, the virus, is much or little; or digested, or undigested.
And with this again consider the place of the Sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or there is no abscess in it.
When therefore your medication is extended in this way, and you see the matter which comes out over the opening of the Sinus, then you know that the Sinus is now adhering, or approaching adherence: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment. But if a subtle virus comes out of the Sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, because there are some men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are some who act contrary to that.
But if undigested pus comes out of the Sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If therefore the adherence of the Sinus is delayed, and its matter is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, truly let the physicians do, so that the medicines are moist in their substance, and dry in their virtue: such as diafinicon ointment, when an excess of addition from zegi is added to it.
And of the last things by which it is cured, it is that you take diafinicon ointment, and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it old wine equal in its substance.
Then mix it with it, and use it.
And now it does something similar to this action, when you do not have diafinicon ointment present, honey, when you boil it down until it thickens, and you use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind everything, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Then spread over it a cloth, and bind it over the sinus: and spread with the honey which you boiled until it thickened: and powder over it spices, and place over it a cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes there is administered in it long birthwort, and roots of celestial lily, and it is lily: and herb flour, and centaury.
Use them simple, or combined, grind them, and sift them: and powder over the honey which I have described, and use it.
But if the matter of the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment: then know that in its depth there is corruption: or it already makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, according to what has been premised. Concerning the treatment of whitlow and the rubbed nail, and the added incision of the finger, and section.
Chapter XCI.
A whitlow is an abscess which is born under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it is born in the other fingers.
When therefore its matter is prolonged, and its cure is neglected, and it becomes inflamed with a hot abscess: or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
When therefore you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you incise with an iron all the excess which remains of the nail.
Then cauterize the wound afterwards.
For cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail already compress the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it, and injure it: then it is necessary that you place a thin spatula under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and push it upwards: and incise that flesh easily, and place upon what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
But if the corruption already affects the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone, and extract it: for it is never healed while the corrupted bone remains in it.
But if you see corrosion and corruption proceeding in the finger, then incise it at one of the joints, according to what has been previously mentioned.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But if attrition or percussion should happen to the nail, and intense pain occurs, then it is necessary that you first bleed the patient.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, with a transverse incision from above downwards.
And take care that the incision does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause intense pain to the patient thereby, and it will be the cause of the growth of added flesh in the place.
Then treat the place with that which soothes pains.
The added digit which is born on the hands of some men, perhaps is wholly fleshy; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them are born at the root of a joint, or its origin is in some nodes of the finger.
That which is born in some nodes of the finger, is not moved; and that which is born at the joint of the finger, perhaps is moved.
Therefore, that one of them which is fleshy, its excision is easy.
That is, to incise it at its root with a broad spatula.
But that whose origin is at the root of a joint, its treatment is difficult.
Therefore abstain from its incision.
However, in that which is born in a finger at the last joint, then it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a round incision up to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Then treat it until it heals.
Now, the adhesion which happens to fingers mutually, very often happens either from a person's birth, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning by fire, and similar things.
Therefore it is necessary that you cut that adhesion until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place between them linen cloths, or cloths infused in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them; or place between them a thin lead plate until the place consolidates as it should.
And similarly if adhesion happens to some fingers with the palm, then cut that adhesion, according to what is prepared and suits the figure of the member.
Concerning the incision of a vice.
Chapter XCII.
Varicose veins are convoluted, thick veins, full of melancholic superfluities which happen in many members of the body; and their occurrence is most in the legs, especially in the legs of those who journey and labor and carry burdens.
Therefore it is necessary that you administer shaking of the body from black bile, several times with strong shaking.
Then phlebotomize the patient in the basilic vein.
The treatment of them with iron, however, is according to two methods.
One of them is that they be cut, and the black blood be drawn out.
And the other method is that the vein be raised, and the whole be drawn out.
The section of it, however, is according to this method.
First bathe the leg with much warm water, until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the leg of the sick person from the upper part of his hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then cut the vein downwards until a quantity of blood comes out which you see to be sufficient, and which the strength of the sick person can bear.
Afterwards bind it: and tell him to abstain from foods which produce black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and this harms the sick person.
Now its elevation is in this manner.
Shave the leg of the sick person if there is much hair on it.
Then put him in a bath; or rub his leg with warm water until it becomes red and the veins swell; or let him take strong exercise, if a bath is not available, until the limb becomes warm.
Then cut the skin in a straight line along the vein: either at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and uncover the vein on all sides until it is visible; and at its appearance you will see it is red tending towards black.
When it is taken from the skin, you see it white as if it were a cord.
Then insert a spatula under it until it is raised and comes out of the skin; suspend it with a blunt hook, gently.
Then make another incision close to that incision, three fingers away.
Then uncover the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Then raise it with spatulas as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need it.
Then raise it and incise it with the last incision near the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision that is above it.
And do this until you pull it out from the incision which is superior, or higher than all the incisions, until when it comes out entirely: then incise it.
But if it does not obey you to pull it out and lift it: then insert a needle with strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert a probe under it: and turn your hand to every part, until it comes out.
And beware lest it be incised.
For if it is incised, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and harm enters upon the patient from it.
Therefore, when you have pulled it out entirely: then place on the place of the wounds wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil: and take care of it, until it is healed.
But if the thing is constricted, having a tortuosity to which there is a winding around the parts, and is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary that you split it on every part of its tortuosity, and the places of its winding.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you lift it entirely: and beware in your section upon it lest you cut a vein, or wound it: for it will become difficult for you to lift, or extract it.
Therefore preserve your prudence.
The form of the incision by which the thing is healed.
The form of a blind hook.
It does not have a curvature like the other hooks, nor is it of a sharp extremity, so that it does not wound a vein: and it is of thick sinuosity, smooth: because if it were thin, it would cut a vein by its thinness: indeed let it have superfluous thickness, as we have said.
Of the extraction of a vein of the leg. Chapter 93.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Algeciras, and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, of little softness, that is, in which neither herb nor tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And its generation indeed is from the putrefaction which happens under the skin, just as serpents and ascarid worms happen within bodies, and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a vehement inflammation happens in the leg.
Then the place is blistered.
Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that blister, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
When therefore its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary that you wrap around it a piece of lead, whose weight is from one and a half drachms to two drachmas, and tie it: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
As often therefore as something comes out of it to the exterior, wrap that in lead, and tie it.
But if it is prolonged much, then cut part of it, and wrap up the remainder.
And do not cut it root and branch before it comes out entirely.
Because if you cut it, it contracts, and enters into the flesh: and causes an abscess, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be treated gently, and drawn out little by little, until it comes out to its end, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein indeed there comes out in certain men that which is in its length five palms and ten.
And now it has come to me, that it came out from a man of twenty palms.
But if it is cut into during your treatment: then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long opening, together with the body, until all that is in it of matter is evacuated: and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings happen to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Therefore treat it, as we said in the division, and with what has been stated before.
Concerning the incision for worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
Chapter 94.
This illness is called in a certain land among us bovine illness: because, for it often happens to cattle, and it is a single small worm which is born between the skin and flesh.
And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending: and its movement from member to member is perceived, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through in the skin, and exits.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Just as worms and serpents occur, that is, earthworms and ascarids in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malignancy.
Because when it goes in the body and rises to the head and arrives at a place, then perhaps it opens there and exits, and destroys the eye: and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, then this is not done except at its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore, it is necessary that you bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature.
Then cut above it and extract it.
But if it goes deep into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the place until it dies.
And what is more feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said. But if you see that it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good binding.
Then cut above it and extract it.
And it is necessary that the patient use purification of his body with medicines dissolving putrid, bad humors.
And let him beware of foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision upon the illness Nakir.
Chapter 95.
This illness is called in our land Nakir: and it is a pain which happens in certain members; then it is transferred from member to member.
And I indeed already saw it, according to what I relate to you.
I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I remained one hour, I saw one swelling moving with a swiftness, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it can be: so that it is like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Therefore the pain receded from that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it arrived in the other arm.
Then she told me that it was revolving in her whole body, according to what I saw.
Therefore I was amazed at the speed of its change from member to member.
And indeed before that I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way.
Nevertheless I saw many who found pain shift from member to member: and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it is, except that it is because the woman was one of those who are of those with dry bodies and exposed veins: hence therefore that shifting windiness appears to the senses.
And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, and hidden veins.
Therefore when you wish its cure, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to your eye, as we said, then bind above it and below it quickly: and cut above it, until that constricted windiness comes out: and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes: then cure it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels windiness, and removes it with foul-smelling pills, and pills of Serapinum, and the like.
Concerning the extraction of arrows.
Chapter XCVI. Arrows are diversified according to their kinds, and according to the places in which they fall in the body.
Their diversity is this: for among them are those which have large and small points; and concave and blunt ones.
And among them are those which have three points.
And among them are those which have barbs.
And among them are those which have barbs.
Those, however, which are according to the members in which they fall, are according to two methods.
For either the members are of the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and the like.
When therefore it falls into any of these members, and the signs of death, which I shall relate to you afterwards, appear to you, then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in most dispositions.
And when those bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and goes out through the dura mater which is over the brain, are: that there happen from it vehement thirst, and dimness of vision, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile.
And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils, or ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And a white moisture similar to pus comes out from the place of the wound.
And something like the watery part of flesh comes out of it.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs, however, of an arrow when it falls into the heart, are: that it is near the left nipple; and one feels with it as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty thing.
And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the motion of the pulse; and black blood runs from the wound.
And coldness of the extremities follows, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Know therefore, that death approaches without doubt.
And a sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung, is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels which follow the neck, become suppurated, and the color of the sick man changes.
And he breathes a great, deep breath; and seeks the intake of cold air.
But if the arrow falls on the membrane which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and great shortness of breath occurs with intense pain, with sighing: and all the members of the shoulders are moved.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food comes out of the wound.
And if an arrow falls into the belly, and is fixed in it: something of the excrement comes out of the wound, or pus, or intestine which has already been broken.
Therefore there is no hope in his cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
But if an arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain is stronger on the patient: then know that it is mortal.
The remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and clavicle, and vertebrae of the back, and breastbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are saved according to various dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery, or nerve; and the arrow is not poisonous.
And I tell you what I saw of the nature of these arrows, that you may thereby understand concerning your cure.
That is, because an arrow fell upon a certain man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of the nose.
Therefore I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell upon him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained from it only a small part of its end, with which it adhered to its shaft: and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with a soft iron head, in which there are no barbs.
Therefore the Jew was healed, and no evil accident happened to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is one which has barbs.
Therefore I cut over it between the two [muscles]: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Therefore I worked delicately with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his abdomen: and we thought that he would die from it.
After therefore thirty days had passed for him, and nothing of his condition had changed, I cut over the arrow: and I worked on it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no ill effect happened to him.
And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound had closed over it.
After therefore seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman into whose abdomen an arrow had fallen, and the wound had closed over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and none of her condition changed, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound closed, and it remained, causing him not much pain: and many similar things to these.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already deviated a little to the right side: and the whole arrow was hidden.
Therefore I was called to his treatment after the arrow's impact for three days.
Therefore I found the wound of the arrow very constricted.
Therefore I searched for it with a slender probe, and did not feel it: and he indeed found a puncture and pain under his right ear.
Therefore I hoped that that puncture was from the point of the arrow.
Therefore I plastered the place with a plaster in which there was attractive and digestive power, trusting in myself that the place would suppurate, and the sign of the arrow would appear to me, so that I might cut over it: and there did not happen in the place an event signifying that the arrow had reached the place.
Therefore I persisted with the plaster on him for many days: and no event happened, and the wound meanwhile healed: and he remained ill from its extraction for a space of days, until he felt the arrow on a certain day inside his nose.
And he told me that.
Therefore I put a sharp, corrosive medicine on that wound for many days, until it was opened: and when I probed it, I felt the slender point of the arrow adhering to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound by means of that sharp medicine, until the point of the arrow appeared visibly to us: and about four months passed with him.
Then after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not yield to extraction: then I did not cease to refine, and devise concerning it with ingenious methods, until I began on it on a certain day with decently made forceps, as their form will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore I restored it, and the wound consolidated, and the patient was healed with complete health: nor did anything at all harm him.
And I relate to you the manner of extraction of certain arrows: so that you may put that as a rule and explanation concerning that which I have not said.
Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed by narration: nor does the book encompass that, and a prudent artisan compares a little with much: and that which is present with that which is absent: and finds a new operation, and a new instrument in the course of the extraneous things of this art when they occur.
Therefore I say that arrows do not come out from the limbs in which they are fixed except in two ways. Or by traction from the place from which it entered.
Or by the opposite of the other part.
And that which goes out from where it entered, is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and is pulled, and goes out.
But if it does not obey exit at the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it some days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its traction is lessened, and its exit.
And similarly if it is fixed in bone, and does not obey you for exit, then leave it also some days: and repeat it with traction and motion every day, until it goes out.
But if it does not obey you for exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone itself on every side with a thin drill, until the arrow is widened.
Then pull it, and extract it.
But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already gone into one ventricle of the brain, and some of those accidents which I have mentioned appear in the sick person: then abstain from pulling the arrow, and leave it, until its being is equal after days.
For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate to the sifach: and the sick person remains for some days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him: then be ingenious in pulling the arrow and extracting it.
But if it is fixed firmly, and does not obey you when you pull it: then apply a drill around the arrow, as I have told you: then treat the place, until it is healed.
But if the arrow is now hidden in the place of the body, and is hidden and concealed from the senses: then search for it with a probe.
But if you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments which are suitable for its extraction.
But if you cannot reach it, because of the tightness of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then cut over it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
But if it has barbs by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them on every side, by every means that you can, and means, if it cannot be released without breaking the barbs, and twisting them, until it comes out.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps to all parts, until you cause it to come out: and the finest things with the finest subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and the attraction of it, and its extraction, becomes difficult for you.
But if you cannot reach it within an hour, then leave it for a few days, until those things which are around it putrefy.
Then try again; for the swelling will be lessened. But if the flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we said of treatment in its chapter: and guard your strength from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And administer the means in every way that is possible for you to remove the arrow: and let it be with ease and calmness, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that, when you pull out the arrow, you make the patient lie in the same position as he was when the arrow struck him.
Because it is more helpful.
But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the positions.
Now, an arrow which emerges from the opposite side, or something of it already protrudes outwards, or the point of the arrow makes a swelling through sensation on the upper part of the nearby skin, and you see it protruding: therefore cut over it, and let the incision be such that forceps can grasp it.
Then pull it out; for it will easily come out.
But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness until the arrow is embedded in the bone, and widens itself; then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days; then try again until it comes out.
But if the wood of the arrow is in it, then push it in with that.
But if the wood has fallen off, and you wish to administer a push: then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow; then push it with that.
But if the arrow is concave, then push it with an instrument entering into it.
For the arrow is lightened by it.
But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you hollow out all the flesh in which is the poison, if it is possible for you.
Then treat it with what is suitable for it.
But if the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near to what you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then sew the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be similar to a bird's beak, which are made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not let go of it.
And many kinds are made of them, large and small and medium-sized, according to the size and smallness of the arrow, and the size of the wound, and its narrowness.
The shape of the concave pusher.
And the shape of the blunt pusher.
This is a blunt end like a radius, so that its entry into the concave arrow is eased, and it is pushed with it.
The end of this concave pusher is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entry of the arrow into it and its pushing are eased.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
Chapter 97. The veins to be phlebotomised, whose custom has run in the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two lacrimal ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Lookers; and the prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and the vein which is at the tip of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins which are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins, moreover, which are bled in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the outer side: and the common people call it the vein of the head.
And the Basilic.
And there is the Median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the Basilic, and it is situated on the inner side: and it is also called Titillicaris.
And the common people call it the vein of the belly.
And the rope of the arm, and it is situated above the bend of the elbow: and it is that in which bloodletting is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with manifest application.
And the Salvatella: and it is a vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb from the outer side.
And the second is the Saphena: and its place is near the heel from the inner side.
And the vein Nesse: and its place is near the heel from the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Indeed, phlebotomy of the two veins which are behind the ears is helpful for chronic catarrhs, and hemicrania, and sahafati, and old bad head ulcers.
And the manner of phlebotomizing it is as I relate.
And it is that the head of the sick person is shaved: and his occiput in the place of the two veins is rubbed with a rough cloth with a good rubbing.
Then let the sick person bind his neck with a fillet until the two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head.
Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there mark with a branding iron.
Then take a lancet phlebotome, and it is that which is called Incidens.
Then insert it under the vein in the skin, until the phlebotome reaches the opening.
Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and incise the vein with the skin with an incised incision.
And let the length of the incision be the quantity of two joined fingers, or about that: and let blood flow out as much as you wish.
Then bind it with lint, and leave it until it heals.
And now the incision of them and their cauterization preceded in the beginning of the book.
Concerning phlebotomy of two arteries in times.
Truly, of the two arteries which are in the two times of phlebotomy, the help is for old hemicrania, and a bad toothache, and persistent ophthalmia, and the course of sharp effused superfluities to the eyes. And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I relate to you.
Let the infirm person strongly constrict his neck until two veins appear manifestly to the sense of sight, and let their pulse be demonstrated under your finger.
Then mark them with a cautery.
Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the cutting phlebotome underneath, and lift the vein upwards.
And incise it, as you did in the other two veins: and let blood flow according to the amount of your necessity. Then loosen the constriction of the infirm, and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Afterwards place a pledget and lint over it, and bind it tightly above: and leave it until it heals.
And now the recollection of them, and their incision, and their extraction have preceded in the beginning of the book.
Concerning phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein.
Truly, the help of phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead is, after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein, for old facial ailments: and for hemicrania, and redness: and foul ulcers.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is, according to what I tell you.
The infirm person constricts his neck with a band until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument which is called a Fossorium.
Whose form is this.
Place the prominent point which is on the head of the Fossorium over the vein itself, and strike upon it with a comb, or with another thing in its manner: and let the blood run according to the quantity which you wish.
Then loosen the perforation of the infirm person, and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotom.
However, it is not necessary that the phlebotom be of a sharp extremity, like the other phlebotoms, but rather of a broad extremity.
And phlebotomize it according to the transverse; because the bone is near: and perhaps in it the phlebotom will be broken when it is thin.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins in the two tear ducts.
Moreover, the benefit of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, is for the eye from scab and redness: and for sebil in the eye, and for sicknesses of the face.
And the manner of their phlebotomy is that the infirm person should bind his neck with a fillet.
Then phlebotomize them; and you should be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made across, a little in length, with a small, somewhat broad phlebotome, for there is no flesh in the place.
For if the phlebotome is of a fine point, perhaps it will break.
Then make the blood run as much as is necessary for you.
And place a pledget on them, and bind them for one night, and unbind them.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the nose.
Moreover, the phlebotomy of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fever, and violent headache, and diseases of the face, such as hemicrania, and redness which happens in the face: especially when it is chronic.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the infirm person should bind his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long phlebotomy instrument; and fix it in the middle of his nose, between that which divides the nose according to its length.
Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you move your hand with the phlebotomy instrument a little; and you should make the blood flow according to your need.
Then bind it for one night.
For it is restored quickly.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the Guidegi.
Truly, the phlebotomy of two Guidegi veins helps in the constriction of breathing, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those which corrode, that is, herpetic esthiomenes.
And the manner of their phlebotomy is that the infirm person should bind himself under both in his neck with a ligature; and the practitioner should stand over the head of the infirm person, and the infirm person should sit upon a seat.
Then the phlebotomist opens the vein to the length of a fairly wide phlebotomy.
Then draw out a moderate quantity of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for it.
Then do similarly with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and bind the two veins with a moderate constriction, so that the infirm person is not strangled.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound heals.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins by Albucasis.
Moreover, the vein of Albucasis is helpful for phlebotomy because it contributes to the canker in the mouth, and the corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those which are in the nose and around it.
And the manner of phlebotomy of these is that you make the infirm one sit before you, and bind his neck with a fillet.
Then roll back his lip and look at the two veins: of which one is to the right of the lip, and the second to the left of it; and the indication of each is by the blackness of both.
And this is true: because around them are small, black veins.
Therefore, incise each with an incisive incision. But if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then attend to the incision of the larger of them, and the more manifest of them.
And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed the custom runs most with it: and incise the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after cephalic phlebotomy.
Truly, the help of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that cephalic phlebotomy is for obstructions which are in the throat, and illness of the uvula, and illnesses of the mouth.
And the manner of phlebotomizing them is that the infirm person sits between your hands before the sun: and lift his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein: and the color of each inclines toward blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize both: and take care lest you injure your hand in phlebotomizing them.
For under them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will happen from those arteries.
Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
Now the three veins which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those in whose phlebotomy custom runs in all men.
And phlebotomy of them is done according to two methods.
Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome: or an olive-shaped one to a sloping thinness: or by cutting with a knife-shaped phlebotome, and it is Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is that which is suitable for section.
And of them are broad and subtle types according to the size of the veins and their narrowness. The form of the myrtle phlebotome is broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of less breadth, and of more subtle point.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of subtle veins, which contain subtle, yellow blood.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the basilica.
Now the basilica, which is one of these three veins, is an aid to phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from sicknesses which are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest and belly: and it befits the phlebotomist, when he phlebotomizes it, that he be cautious, and be on his guard against it, for under it is an artery.
Therefore if he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will happen.
Therefore it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a pointed phlebotomy instrument; rather, let it be cut with an alnesil.
But if the basilica does not appear in manifest appearance, then it is necessary that you abandon it and change to another, or seek some branch of it: or phlebotomize in its place the cord of the arm.
For it itself is manifest, and cut it with the alnesil phlebotomy instrument, as we have said.
But if you wish the phlebotomy of that same vein, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm that you touch the place until you know the place of the pulse.
Then mark the place with a cautery, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with the alnesil phlebotomy instrument, as we have said.
And beware lest the incision fall into the space from the place of the artery.
And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place which you marked with the cautery, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
But if you see the blood at the phlebotomy leaping up like the urine of a boy, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Then therefore hasten, and place your finger upon it for a long space, then remove your finger.
If therefore the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then bind the arm, and release it: and let the patient beware of movement of it: and be over his fear.
And let him not move it for a few days, until it is healed.
But if the blood is not cut off, and it overcomes you: and medicine is not present to you in your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
For its extremities are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Or take the bark of a fistuca, and split it: take one half, and bind it over the place of the vein constriction decently, with a bandage and powders until another day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
And if not: then treat it with that whose mention preceded from the place of powders cutting off the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in most dispositions, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the dark vein.
Now the help of phlebotomy of the dark vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head, and the lower part of the body: therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the basilica, and a branch of the cephalic, as we said.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomist that he be cautious about its phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve.
If therefore he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, numbness happens in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not completely healed.
And this nerve often appears to the sense.
But if it is hidden in some men, and is subtle, and is not shown: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy by which you phlebotomize, an incision with an Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
But if the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the Cephalic vein.
Moreover, phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to illnesses of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by puncturing with an olive-shaped phlebotome, or with a myrtle-shaped phlebotome: because it is the safest of all veins, because there is neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it. Nevertheless it is fitting for you in phlebotomy, that you avoid with the phlebotome only the head of the biceps, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found with the first puncture, that it be repeated upon it with phlebotomy several times. Nevertheless, perhaps it will become inflamed in some men when it is not phlebotomized at the first puncture, but that inflammation does not harm it in any way.
Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Moreover, the quality of phlebotomy, and its consequences arising from it, in whose rectification it behooves you to think.
First therefore of that it is necessary that you know, that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health, and its continuance, and precaution against the coming of illnesses.
And that phlebotomy be done in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Median, and the Basilic.
And that phlebotomy be done at the beginning of Spring upon fasting, in spring and summer: and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be done on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomy however which is administered in illnesses, does not have a determined hour: but when convenience and necessity prompt to it, in the night, or day, and at every hour, and at every time.
And it is not fitting that boys be bled until fourteen years come upon them.
Nor let a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth month to the seventh.
Nor let old men be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore when anyone wishes to be bled for whatever reason: it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained faeces in them: lest the veins attract during phlebotomy from the bowels putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members.
Nor let a patient suffering from nausea, that is, a sickening fullness, be bled; nor one who is intoxicated, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Nor one ill with dropsy.
And let phlebotomy be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhoea, excessive intercourse, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and everything that weakens the bodily or vital strength.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with food and drink and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him: or let him take some exercise, so that the blood may be thinned.
And place his phlebotomy in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we have said: and strive that his chest be evacuated that day from all evil accidents, both animal, such as anxiety, anger, and fear: and bodily, such as labor, pain, excessive intercourse, and the like.
And let him have present in his seat things with whose use the custom of men runs, from fragrance and scent, and dancing and things like these, to the extent possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion, which is higher than the cushion of the one to be phlebotomized; afterwards let him draw out his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice or thrice.
Then let him tie the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because when constriction is unequal, or excessive, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Then after the constriction it is necessary that the one to be phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins swell and become apparent to the sense.
Then let the phlebotomist wipe the patient with a little old oil.
Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself below the place where he wishes to phlebotomize, a little: so that the vein does not slip away and the incision is not missed.
Because there are veins which you find like a fleeing cord during phlebotomy; and there are those which are full of wind; and when you place the phlebotomy instrument on it, it contracts under the instrument, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein; and if he does open it, it is constricted: therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm and careful in all these matters.
Then let him remove the phlebotomy instrument.
And if not, then repeat it another time a little below that place, or above it quickly, if the place is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, or the patient is frightened, then leave him for a day or two days: and do not tighten the ligature.
For perhaps it will draw a hot abscess.
Nor should he enter a bath.
Then let him repeat the phlebotomy, if he wishes.
But if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly, and you fear that the quantity of blood you desire will not come out: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same opening according to its straightness, and add a little to the operation.
And do this quickly, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place is in many men a small operation.
Therefore if you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat it at all, for nothing excuses you. And place on it something of the dregs of oil; because it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomy, which phlebotomizes veins in the prohibition of the flow of blood: and they do this, theriac alfarach and sagzenea, when one of them is placed on the place.
For blood is thinned and dissolved when it is thick.
But if a large abscess happens at the place of phlebotomy, for this happens many times, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except at that time, or the opening of the vein is small, then hasten and place on the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated a little: and bind it for an hour: because it is dissolved.
And it is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood from the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
And indeed abscesses and swellings often happen at the phlebotomy of the basilica.
Therefore put your hand on it, then if you find softness at your compression on it, then that swelling is bad.
Beware therefore, that you put on it something of that which we have said.
For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Then take care of it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract from every man from the blood according to the quantity of his strength.
And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it becomes red: and similarly if you see it thick: then let it out until it becomes thin: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the vein phlebotomy be widened, and the phlebotomist be wide: and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary that he extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow: and the better method that is administered in vein phlebotomy is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of a nerve: and it is more laudable, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
And for whom fainting is accustomed to come upon in phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice: or in sugarcane juice, if it is warm: and extract blood from him in three or four stages.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in dates syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, or in aromatic perfumed syrup.
But if fainting happens during phlebotomy, and its cause is the exit of much blood: then it is necessary that he take in drink meat water and fine perfumed syrup: and use aromatherapy with aloe, and let his chest be anointed with it: and use the other things which we have said in the division in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
But he who wishes to bleed his arm, and to release his blood a second time: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he release blood gradually according to the amount of his strength on continuous days.
But he who wishes to bleed his arm, and to release his blood a second time, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
But he who wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite of the part to which it inclines: it is necessary that he be bled on the second or third day.
But in whose body there is much blood already heated, and sharpened, and causes fever to happen: it is necessary that much blood come out of him at one time, and a large quantity be drawn from him: and the opening be enlarged until fainting happens: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy: and that you put your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not happen instead of fainting.
For often that happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence occurs.
And it is not necessary, when you wish to bleed the arm and release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that it be pressed upon vehemently, and the bent arm be quickly extended.
For that is very bad; indeed, leave it until it is bled a second time.
Or remove with the sharpness of a phlebotomy instrument that which has coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place upon it something of salt dissolved in water.
And place upon it something of theriac alfarach, or sagzene, and apply gentle compression until the blood flows out.
But if the vein is already inflamed, then leave it, and do not cover it, until the inflammation subsides.
But if necessity demands a second bloodletting, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize in the same place, or in another vein in the other arm.
Moreover, the rope of the arm is phlebotomized in the place of the Median and Basilic veins, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the manner of this phlebotomy is that the patient should put his hand in warm water until the skin reddens and the vein clearly appears.
Then it should be bound above it with a ligature of moderate tightness.
Then phlebotomize transversely little by little, neither laterally nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize slightly above the joint of the hand.
And indeed, the running of blood into warm water is most done in wintertime.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy, however, of the Salvatella of the right hand, is beneficial for liver ailments.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that you constrict the Salvatella of the hand with a ligature, or with your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly apparent.
Then phlebotomize it transversely.
And if you incise it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
And be careful not to excessively cut your hand with the phlebotomy instrument.
For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, denuded of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and will be prevented from flowing.
Therefore, when you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not close quickly.
And similarly it is necessary that you do with every constricted branch.
Truly, the help of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it contributes to the illnesses of the spleen: and similarly do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
Moreover, the help of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for illnesses which are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menstrual flow, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should put his foot into warm water: and make friction upon it until the veins swell: and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap.
And indeed the place of the vein is near the heel, appearing towards the great toe: and many branches ramify from it on the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its confluence; for this is better and safer.
But if you phlebotomize it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are under it on the surface of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy, by which you phlebotomize it, transversely, as if you wished to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be skillful.
But if the flow of blood is prevented, then bathe his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into it, until it is evacuated.
But if he misses the vein in the first attempt, then let him repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you avoid the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is near the heel on the outer side.
And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the patient should enter the bath and hurry; and bind his leg from the side of the hip to above the heel with four fingers' breadth, with a long, thin band; for it does not appear except because of that.
When therefore it appears, then phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you, or according to the transverse direction: and it is better, or to incise it with an incision, or to cut it with a section.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most men.
But if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the sense at all: then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood you wish flow.
Then loosen the binding, and place a piece of leather over the place of phlebotomy, and bind the place.
For it heals quickly.
Concerning cupping, and the quality of its use.
Chapter XCVIII.
Cups are made from horns, and from metal, and from glass.
And cupping is done in two ways.
With scarification and the extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification. And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Or it is with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And there are fourteen places on the body for cuppings which are administered with scarification and bloodletting.
One of which is the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck: and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are two plates of the neck on both sides together: and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades: and the cuppings of Alachosos on the end of the spine: and the cuppings of the two elbows, and they are the middle of the two arms: and the cuppings of the two thighs: and the cuppings of the two calves.
And cupping indeed does not draw blood from you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that strength does not fall from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Nor should cupping be administered, whether with fire or without fire, in any illnesses which arise from repletion, until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity demands cupping because of illness or habit, we administer it at any time at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
That is because there are men in whom blood multiplies until it needs extraction by cupping, and they find heaviness and headache in their head.
And there are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And there are those who find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And there are those who scratch the place of their cupping. And there are those whose laughter increases.
And there are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth; or their tongue is ulcerated, and they spit blood.
And there are those whose sleep increases.
And there are those who see in their sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to them. Therefore, when we see something of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order that bloodletting be done, after two or three hours of the day have passed. Now, the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that it helps with heaviness in the head and that which spreads to the eyes.
