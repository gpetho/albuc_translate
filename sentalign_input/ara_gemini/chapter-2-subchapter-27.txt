Chapter twenty-seven on removing the nodules that appear on the lips.
Many people may experience small, hard tumors inside their lips.
Some of them resemble chickpea grains, while others are smaller or larger.
It is necessary to turn the lip outward, make an incision on each nodule, catch it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Then, after cutting, pack the area with powdered vitriol until the bleeding stops.
Then, rinse the mouth with vinegar and salt, and treat the areas with astringents until the wounds heal.
