and when the incision is completed and all the flesh is removed, then fill the eye with ground salt or distill red eyewash and similar corrosive medicines, and place cotton soaked in egg white on the eye, so that it is protected from a hot abscess; and if anything remains, and hot blood rises, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with soothing substances for hot abscesses; then return to your procedure until it is healed, and do the same when flesh is added to the eye in this manner.	And when you have finished your incision and removed all the chemosis, fill the eye with powdered salt or instil the red powder or similar corrosive; and apply to the outside of the eye cotton wool with white of egg to ward off an abscess. If there is any chemosis left and blood is getting the better of you and you fear an abscess, then desist and treat the eye with those means for settling a tumour. Thereafter return to your operation till cured. So must you do with superfluous flesh that arises in the eye.	0.905352
But always, you must adjust the treatment of each weak eye according to the natural way; and the accidental way, with the work of iron; and do not place your hand in any of these procedures until you see that the members can endure that procedure.	But you must avoid treating surgically any eye that is weak, whether congenitally or by acquired disease. Never set your hand to an operation of this kind till you have seen if the organ can endure such an operation.	0.6505532
