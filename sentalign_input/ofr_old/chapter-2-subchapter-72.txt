Of wandering or erratic behavior
Erratic condition is when the female genitalia are not pierced, or the opening is small; it is congenital or occurs due to disease; or it is due to added flesh, or thick or thin syfac, located deep in the womb, or on the sides, or below, or anywhere; it prevents conception, childbirth, and sometimes menstruation. The knowledge of this is by the inspection of the midwife. If the blockage is visible, search with your fingers or a probe. If it is thin syfac and near the two lips, hurry and break it like this: put your two index fingers together, and the woman lies on her back with her legs spread; then spread the two lips firmly until the thin syfac is broken, and the blockage is opened; then take wool, moisten it in oil, and place it on the spot, and the woman should lie with a man every day, so it does not close again. If the syfac is hard and thick, cut it with a spatula resembling a myrtle leaf. If the blockage is of born flesh, suspend it with a hook and cut it; have hemostatic medicines ready, like acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, along with egg white; then insert a wide lead tube so the wound cannot close; and keep it long, administering a dry linen tent; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
