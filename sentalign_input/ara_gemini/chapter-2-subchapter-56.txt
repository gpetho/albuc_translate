Chapter fifty-six on the rash that appears on the foreskin, glans, blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the glans.
This ulcer often appears in the urethra, and it is a fleshy, foul growth, and it can be malignant or benign.
The benign one should be grasped with a delicate hook and cut until it is completely cleaned, then apply to it cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterwards with palm ointment until it heals.
But if the ulcer is malignant and foul-colored, then cauterization should be used after cutting and scraping it.
If the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and some of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and some of it is outside, then the ulcer that is inside should be extracted first until it heals, and then treat it from the outside because if you treat them both together, you cannot be sure that the foreskin will not be perforated.
Blackness and decay may also occur in the labia and in the foreskin, so it is necessary to scrape all that has blackened and is about to decay or has decayed, then smear on it honey with ground, sifted pomegranate peels and kirsana, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped iron in this way:
Cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and a wound if it becomes infected.
If the glans penis is eroded and completely gone at some point, then a lead tube should be inserted into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it.
As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans penis, and this adhesion only occurs in someone whose foreskin is intact and who is not obligated to be circumcised, and its adhesion may occur due to a wound or swelling, it should be peeled off with a blunt scalpel until the bond dissolves and the glans penis is freed from every side.
If it is difficult to distinguish them upon investigation, then something from the glans penis and the foreskin should be peeled off, because the foreskin is thin, so it may be perforated quickly due to its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the glans penis with a thin linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water so that they do not stick together again, then treat it with an astringent drink until it heals.
