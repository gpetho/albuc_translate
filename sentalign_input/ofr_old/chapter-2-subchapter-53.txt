Of the chancre
We have said in the division the characteristics of cancer, and how it should be treated with medicines, and how to avoid the treatment with iron; and we say cancer developed in the womb, and there is great caution in the treatment, and the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where it can be scraped out such as cancer in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, it should be completely removed when it is in the beginning; and when it is large and old, then you should not approach it, because I never managed to heal any; nor did anyone heal any before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you sometimes purge the patient of black bile; then make him bleed if he has clear excess, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the procedure; then throw your hooks into the cancer, and pull it from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything; and let the blood flow completely, and press the place well with your hand or something, and if the bleeding troubles you from the incision of the artery or the vein, then cauterize it until the blood stops; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
