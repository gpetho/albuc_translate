This book is finished for the time being, either because I have finished explaining everything to you, my son, or because this book is a part of the science of medicine and I have reached the end of its objectives in terms of clarity and explanation.
Since practical work with the hands is highly esteemed in our land and our time, medicine continues to advance until almost all of its secrets are mastered and its effects are eliminated. And as for the remnants of the early writings which are still extant, their authors have either abandoned them because of the progress of the hands and their knowledge, or because of their errors and confusion, until their meaning has become obscure and their usefulness has waned
I have seen that some of these matters are explained in an unclear or ambiguous fashion in the earlier books, while their authors have neglected to explain their practical aspects or provide illustrations. So I have decided to elucidate them in this treatise through clarification, explanation and brevity, and to include images and other instruments which are essential for understanding.
The reason why there is no skilled surgeon among us in our time is because the art of surgery is lengthy and requires many years of training before one can become proficient in it. Galen described this very art in his books. Until one is able to grasp the functions of the organs, their humors, temperaments, connection and separation, the bones and nerves, their veins and arteries, and the locations of their insertions and exits
And thus Hippocrates said: "There are many physicians in name only, but few in reality, especially in the art of surgery. We ourselves have mentioned this matter at the beginning of this book.
Since he who has not learned what we have mentioned concerning anatomy is likely to make mistakes which may cause the death of people, as we have seen many instances of this in this science where incompetence has been attributed to knowledge and learning which is not true
When I saw a layman physician who had cut into the neck of a pregnant woman, causing her to bleed to death between his hands.
I also saw another physician who had attempted to remove a large stone from a man's bladder with a piece of metal, but the operation was unsuccessful and the stone remained in place A man died three days later, and I had recommended that the stone be removed, for I saw the condition of the stone and the cause of death that resulted from it
I also saw another physician who was lazy among some of the people of our land concerning the practice of medicine.
There was a black slave who had a fracture in his leg close to the heel with a wound, and the physician who saw him was hasty and did not set the fracture properly, so he bound the wound tightly with strips of cloth and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he left the slave and did not look after him any more, until he died of his wound and swelling of his leg and foot.
I called for him and he hurried to bandage the wound and the swelling in his leg disappeared, but the gangrene had already spread in the limb and I was unable to save it
The gangrene continued to spread in the limb until the limb died
I saw another physician who treated a cancerous tumor and the patient recovered after some days, as the tumor was black pus which did not require exposure to iron salts.
Except when it is in a limb which must be saved at all costs.
Certainly, my son. Know that work done by hand is divided into two parts: work that promotes safety and work that is done alongside medical treatment in most cases.
Work of this kind necessitates caution and prudence in every place where danger and fear are present.
For one lacking wisdom will not find the way to speak or to act with safety, so take heed of yourselves, be cautious and vigilant, and do not neglect mercy or compassion
Utilize the better way that leads to safety, peace of mind, and noble goals, and abstain from perilous diseases and painful afflictions.
Beware of what may bring disgrace upon your religion and your people. This is greater in the world and the Hereafter for your worth
As Galenus has said in some of his sayings, do not be healers of bad diseases, for this will make you bad doctors.
This section of the text is divided into three parts.
The First Chapter
Regarding the instruments of surgery and their arrangement, from the tenth century until now, pictures of instruments and all that is needed for handwork in general
The Second Chapter
As for the incisions and excisions, fractures and amputations, and similar procedures, all of these are included and explained in detail with pictures of instruments
The Third Chapter
Regarding fractures and dislocations, treatment of wounds and similar matters, all of these are detailed in this section with pictures of instruments from the tenth century until now
Chapter One.
In the First Chapter.
Before we discuss the work itself, it is essential to mention the adversities and dangers associated with it, as well as the precautions to be taken in any given situation.
I say that the knowledge of the benefits of surgery and its dangers is vast and profound, and the secrets of healing are often hidden and known only to a select group of experts
There are many different types of people involved in this field, some of whom are simple and cautious, while others are more adept and fearless
I say that surgery benefits everyone, regardless of their temperament or the nature of their ailment, whether it be hot or cold, wet or dry
Some people claim that surgery is beneficial in hot and dry conditions, while others argue that it is ineffective in cases of heat and moisture because the nature of fire is hot and the nature of moisture is cold
It is possible to treat a hot and dry ailment with a hot remedy, and a moist and cold ailment with a cold remedy. Some people claim that fire can cure a hot and dry ailment, while others disagree, stating that fire is the cause of such an ailment in the first place Since fire is combined with the body and moisture is added to it, the body becomes cold
I say this because I have seen many instances where this has been the case, and it is not appropriate to generalize about it Each person has a different temperament and different diseases, with different symptoms and durations
Concerning all other diseases, there is no fear of them, nor any specifically cold and wet diseases, for all physicians are in agreement that they all benefit from this treatment.
Know then, O sons of knowledge, that the secret of treatment lies in fire and medicine, for fire is a single essence that does not transcend its effect on any member without benefitting it, and does not harm any other part connected to it except as is necessary for the cure.</start_of_turn>
The treatment with the burning medicine may extend beyond the limb and may cause a disease in the limb itself, which may impede its treatment or even cause death. Fire, however, with its dignity and virtue, does not act thus except to expel the evil.</start_of_turn>
We have learned this from experience, serving for a long time, taking care of the art and being attentive to the facts.</start_of_turn>
So we have dispensed with lengthy discourse, since it is not befitting of this book to elaborate on matters which are obvious to those who possess understanding and knowledge of this art.
Know then, O sons of knowledge, that they have differed in the time in which they found benefit in this treatment, and that the best of times is the time of spring.</start_of_turn>
I say that the treatment has been found useful in every time, for the damage caused by time is absorbed in the benefit obtained from this treatment.</start_of_turn> Especially when the disease is an urgent and powerful one that cannot be delayed, for fear of its increasing harm which surpasses that of the passage of time.</start_of_turn
And do not imagine, O sons of knowledge, that because the physicians have said that this treatment is beneficial for a general disease that it will not return to its original state once it has departed.
Is not the mischief of the people that they suppose that the cause of pain is other than the medicine that allayed the temper and dried up the humors which are the cause of the pain.
Indeed, the cause of pain is not other than the medicine that quickly relieves it, strengthens it, and increases its power.
The disease may sometimes recede with time, according to the temperament of the patient and the capacity of the disease and what facilitates its growth in the body and its abstinence from food and the like of that
The learned one should know that the disease which the physician employs is a mild disease, of little humors and moisture. Like the bite of a tooth concerning pain, it may sometimes disappear without it.
As for the general saying, they are all wrong because they think that there is no remedy except for medicine and not for anything after the occurrence of the disease and the like of that.
Indeed, the meaning of the proverb is that whenever we use one kind of treatment for a disease and it does not recover, we then use another kind of treatment and it recovers from that. It is not like the generality of the people and many of the physicians.
Perhaps it is better for the physician to go to the root of the matter than for him to stick to the general principle that it does not benefit the state of the disease
For indeed, I have seen that this is done in some patients without any benefit, and even with more harm than before, as they say.
If the cold is applied too quickly to a feverish patient, it melts in the fire and produces a stench. It is better to work slowly and cautiously, as the quickest and most correct method is to do the work as God wills.
The sections of this chapter have been arranged from the head to the foot to make it easier for the student to grasp what is desired
Chapter One
The head is like a single vessel.
These two factors contribute to headaches, eye and ear infections, sleep disorders, toothache and sore throat The cold is like a patient suffering from fever, phlegm and swelling.
The patient must vomit three or four times to be cured of the ailment
Then he should be made to swallow his saliva and sit between the palms of your hands, placing your hands over his chest.
Then place the heel of your hand on the bridge of his nose between his eyes, with the middle finger doing the work
Then remove the clot of yellow pus that appears in this manner
Expose the bone as much as the head of the tibia or the heel of the ulna, grasp the hand and do not let go until the limb is restored or until another hand is available. Until you see the bone as described, then take some salt and dissolve it in water and give him to drink and apply it to the place and leave it for three days
Then apply a wet compress to the wound and leave it in place until the phlegm has gone out of the fire. Then remove the compress and apply a liberal amount of aloe to the wound, God willing, until it heals.
Some say that the wound is better when left open than when closed, as long as the pus remains.
And some advise that skin be left on the bone until some of its thickness has burned away, then it should be removed, and the remaining bone should be treated.
Others say that great force should be used until it affects the bone strongly, causing it to break like the splinter of a ship or a small ulcer, and they claim that this causes the smoke of the head to ascend and leave the wound open for a long time
Then it is treated until it is healed, and I have not seen these two methods of treatment in some people except on the road of madness and leaving it at rest is better and safer if the head is not severed at its natural junction as I have seen in all other organs
Especially when the head is weak by nature. The first method is better and safer for me, God willing, and I advise you to do the same
Chapter Two.
Also in the head case
If there is something in the head and it has been delayed and prolonged, and the ointment and bandage and sweating and washing and the like have been used for it, and especially if one of the humps has already been treated, it will not benefit from all of that. Look If the head is strong in its structure by nature and is not weak, and if there is a severe wound above that little one. Then he sews upon every head of the bones until the skin becomes taut and the bone is exposed as much as we have described. Then he sews upon every head of the bones until the skin becomes taut and the bone is exposed in the place known as the facet, and lighten your hand in this place and do not uncover the bone, for the reason is that it causes great pain in comparison with the pain of all the other parts of the head. I shall mention this method in its place.
Then he sews upon every head of the bones until the skin becomes taut and the bone is exposed in the place known as the facet, and lighten your hand in this place and do not uncover the bone, for the reason is that it causes great pain in comparison with the pain of all the other parts of the head. This is the method that is used for the horns of the head and the back of the head, and this is its form
Third part.
In the acute case of fracture of the limb that has not yet consolidated
If there is a fracture of the head and pain with swelling and protrusion of the eyeball, then drain the abscess with medicinal poultices for the head and use all the treatments mentioned in the classification of diseases, and if this does not occur there is a swelling on two faces Or by acute medication of strong heat or by iron.
Or if the swelling is caused by medication, take a needle and take one-fourth of the millet and cover the surrounding area with it, then make an incision in the place of pain from the prominence with a broad knife until there is a space under the skin that can hold a millet.
Then insert it under the skin until it disappears, and tighten it securely and bind it firmly, and leave it for five hours or more, then remove the millet and remove the swelling, and leave the wound for two or three days, then carry out the treatment
The wound must be closed with sutures until the area is healed, and then it should be treated with ointment until it is healed, God willing. If you wish, you may also use some caustic medications that are mentioned in the eighteenth chapter on caustic medications.
And as for the specific method, it is mentioned in this passage: 'The wound must be closed with sutures until the area is healed'.
The wound must be closed with sutures until the area is healed, and then it should be treated with ointment until it is healed, God willing.
Then you put it on the site of the pain and hold your hand and move your thumb slightly, and the amount of heat that burns the skin is like half of it Then you move your hand so that it does not burn the blood vessels that are underneath, and you soak the sutures in salt water and put them on the site and leave them for three days. Then you leave the sutures for a while and treat the wound with ointment until it is healed, God willing
And if you wish, you may also use some caustic medications that are mentioned in the eighteenth chapter on caustic medications.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the section on the specific method.
If you treat the wound as we mentioned earlier and what is mentioned in the sections on the classification of diseases, then you will not find any other treatment for it except what we mentioned of the medicine or the burn The wound must be closed with sutures until the area is healed, and then it should be treated with ointment until it is healed, God willing. If you wish, you may also use some caustic medications that are mentioned in the eighteenth chapter on caustic medications
You must beware of the fracture of the jaw which moves when you bite down on the opening of the palate or the nerve that moves it during swallowing.
Be cautious of the fracture of the jaw which moves when you bite down on the opening of the palate or the nerve that moves it during swallowing. Be especially cautious of those who are inexperienced and have not been trained, and leave the work to the first person who is skilled and experienced
The fracture of the jaw which moves when you bite down on the opening of the palate or the nerve that moves it during swallowing is to be mentioned along with the bleeding of the temporal artery on the face in its place. If you see those who are learned and skilled not doing this, then do not do it yourself
I have seen a case where the body was limp and pale like a corpse in the middle of the head as we described, and the wound was treated until it healed, by the grace of God
If you wish to use the clamp which we mentioned in the section on the ligature of the arteries, then this is better than the knife and the lancet
Chapter V.
Regarding the pain in the ears...
If there is something in the ear which causes pain and discomfort, and all the treatments which we mentioned in the division have not relieved the pain, then know that there is a swelling which is called the "knot" which has appeared there
Then it will burst after inflating the whole ear as if it were rotating or surrounding it all around if there is pain in it And it will come out from the root of the ear slightly after learning the position with the needle and there will be ten points in each ear or thereabouts, and then treat the places until they heal, by the grace of God
Sixth Chapter.
In the Chapter of Soreness of the Muscles.
Soreness which is treated with oil is the kind which arises from phlegm, as described in the sections on diseases
and does not arise from cavity or nerve damage
When it is treated with unguents and washes and powders, it does not require anything further. One at the root of the ear, two below the middle of the eyebrow, and three at the junction of the lips.
And make the application from the side away from the diseased part, for the expansion takes place in the healthy side
The shape of the application should be like a triangle whose apex is at the root of the ear and the base is under the chin, with a length equal to the length of the thumb
The oil is rubbed on the area until it has soaked into the skin to a depth equal to half the thickness of the skin, and this is a kind of plaster which is excellent because it is neither too soft nor too hard And the plaster should have a moderate consistency, then be applied to the area until it solidifies. God willing, it will heal the soreness if it is done as directed.
Seventh Chapter
Chapter of Chronic Swelling
If the swelling persists after treatment and there is no reduction in the heat, four things are required: A triangular application on each side of the head, one in the middle of the head as mentioned previously, and one on the crown of the head as described earlier
The method for excision is as follows: and it may also be necessary to perform it on the mouth of the stomach if it is swollen. Then it is treated with what follows.
The eighth section.
In the pit of oblivion.
That which is from mucus which necessitates that the little be excised or the large intestines and the pills which contain brains be eliminated.
Then it grasps its head and carries it to the back and the surgeon writes the inscription of the antidote on a piece of aloe and throws it into the fire
And do that on the level which has been mentioned previously. If the person is a cripple or if there are three fistulas in the back of the head, they are placed in a line from the top of the head to the nape of the neck
And make between each fistula and the next a breadth equal to the thumb, and then treat the intestines with what follows. If you wish to increase it and the little is limited for that, remove the middle intestine
If you wish to increase it further, remove two corners then treat until it heals, and it will be oily like the preceding case.
The ninth section
In the pit of the belly and relaxation of all the body
It necessitates the advancement in the evacuation of the head with the intestines and what we have mentioned previously. Then grasp the little head and remove a fistula from the middle of the head and two fists from each corner of the head and one from the back of the head.
And do that on the vertebrae of the neck. If it necessitates more than that and the patient is strong and capable of enduring it, remove four fistulas from the vertebrae of the back I will speak to you until your skin boils and your hand rises. Then I will treat you according to what I have mentioned until your pain is gone, God willing.
Chapter X.
In the handling of pain.
When a wound is painful due to bile, its head must be elevated above the level of the large veins and all treatment mentioned previously should be undertaken if the cause is great and the pain is severe, so that medication can be taken.
If the patient is young and cannot tolerate medication, do not perform major surgery or apply strict fasting for a long period of time before improving his diet.
Then I will speak to you until your skin boils and your hand rises. Then I will treat you according to what I have mentioned until your pain is gone, God willing And on every tenth part of the head, if the patient is strong and capable, I will perform a flank incision at the jugular vein and in the loin of the loin, and I will make an opening on the front of the neck and the back, and this will be a complete treatment for the pain.
If the cause is young, make a small incision like this
Chapter X
On the management of boils.
If the cause of the boil is fatty and viscous bile, I will perform a flank incision as mentioned previously
If the cause of the boil is dark and the patient is greasy, do not elevate the head and do not apply fasting as mentioned previously
Wash the head and make a tight bundle from silk thread, then pass it through the middle of the head and the small finger [index finger] should reach the base of the hair. Then take a single drop of unguent from the udder of a pregnant goat.
Wash the head and make a tight bundle from silk thread. Pass it through the middle of the head, so that the small finger reaches the base of the hair. Then take a single drop of unguent from the udder of a pregnant goat. Apply it to the head and leave it for a while until it cools. Do this every week along with the other treatments until the ailment is cured, God willing.</start_of_turn>
And if you see that there are many small boils that have appeared without your hand being grasped by the towel, then this is a sign that the treatment is too strong. This type of salve is harmful to the brain with excessive use.</start_of_turn>
Then apply a soft compress soaked in oil or fat from chicken.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 12.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the water blister that descends into the eye.</start_of_turn
If you notice at the beginning of the water blister descending into the eye, then immediately prevent the head and hair from all moisture and keep it dry in the bath or on the road for a few days.</start_of_turn
Then take a hold of the head and make a bundle in the middle of the head, and put two fingers over the temples if the water blister descends into both eyes, or one finger if it descends into one eye.</start_of_turn
Then cut away all the blood vessels and nerves under the skin and keep the abscesses wide open to prevent bleeding.</start_of_turn
If you see something of it, grasp it on the spot with any available treatment. Remain calm and utilize the ligature of arteries and cutting them off to prevent bleeding.
It may be bound around bones at two points with two ligatures.
The third part is the rectum.
In the veins of the rectum
If the veins of the eye are permanently congested and were previously caused by the arteries that are outside the head and enter the head, and are stopped because of the cold of the bile that has increased, this is a sign of a spasm of the rectum A condition in the middle of the head and two on the temples and two in the pelvic region, and if it extends to the increase of the bile of the small intestine in all parts surrounding the eye on the side of the cheek with a small swelling.
The fourth part is the brain
In the bones of the nose
If treatment for what we mentioned in the division does not occur, and the swelling persists for three days, then cut off the supply of the marrow of the middle ear with the olive oil compress Then apply the olive oil compress to the marrow of the middle ear above the eyebrow under the hair and preserve the artery without cutting it off, this is the treatment of the spasm.
The fifth part is the bone of the jaw
In the swelling of the cheek of the eye
If the cheek of the eye relaxes from illness or moisture, put a crescent-shaped bandage on it
If necessary, make incisions above and below the joint, a little wider than the nails in each direction, and distant from the edges of the joint. The length of each incision should be equal to the breadth of the joint.
Do not make the incisions too wide, but rather as much as covers a third of the skin, and be equal in size to the mark.
Sixth Chapter.
On the Knee Joint.
If the membranes have turned inwards in the knee, there are two types in it Either the knee is burned or infiltrated with a warming medicine. If the knee is burned, it is necessary to give a little time before removing the membrane if it is possible to do so, until it has become longer and more even
If it is grasped at its origin and the knee is relaxed, it will open wide. If it is grasped at its furthest point and the knee is relaxed, put a little bougie in the crease of the knee and teach the knee to be flexible by marking a sign like a leaf on the knee joint with the thumb
The sign begins close to the membrane, and under the knee you place a sponge soaked in urine or in the saliva of dogs, and then cover this mark with a dressing of this kind
Then you should practice in this way until the surface of the skin becomes like the shape of a sheet of paper, with a specific mark and a sign of health that your work has been successful and that the knee joint is not stiff and that the feeling has returned to the knee and the knee has become flexible again
Keep your hand away and leave it for three days, then put on it a bandage of butter until the wound is healed, and then apply the plaster until it is complete, and God willing, if there is any hair remaining after that and the knee is relaxed.
Return the eye to its original position as you first did, and if there is hair in the lower eyelid, remove it until it returns to its natural position without causing hair loss from the eyeball. As for the eye that is treated with the blistering agent, command the attendant to leave the sutures until they lengthen and become even.
Then make from the sponges a piece like a leaf of gold, then take from the known soap and from the unmixed gypsum of each one a weight of dirhams or as much as you like, and mix them all together and do it quickly lest it dry out.</start_of_turn> Then spread some of it on the sponges which you have made like a leaf of gold and put it on the eyelid of one or both eyes and put under the eye a cotton swab soaked in urine in the pupil of the eye and the head of the attendant in the cheek.</start_of_turn>
And put your index finger over the medicine and press it slightly and move it whenever you feel the attendant feeling it because it will feel like fire. As long as it feels the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. If the burning subsides, withdraw the medicine and wash the eye with water.</start_of_turn>
And if you see that the eyelid has lifted as it lifts when burning with fire or cutting, do not give it any more medicine until it has subsided and you have completed your work and have blown out the lamp, and then put on it the ointment until it is expelled.</start_of_turn>
Then treat it with the nourishing ointment or the like until it heals. And be cautious in your work that you preserve the utmost care that no medicine should fall into the eye, for if it does after days and hair has fallen out of the eye.
Return the medicine to the place where it was relaxed from the special jaw as you did before, then proceed until it is healed, as this is the correct approach.
Observe that the eyes of people differ in size, so be aware of this and do not deviate from the correct path for one who has a large or small eye
Seventh Chapter
Regarding the swelling of the eyes which is manifested in the corners of the eyes
If you treat the swelling as mentioned in the classification of diseases, the treatment will not be effective unless you address this factor.
It is necessary to place the head in your lap and hold the head with your hands, preventing movement and any pressure on the head
Then put a damp compress over the egg white or on the tip of the nose on the eye, and cover the area with a bandage
The swelling will be like that of a rooster's tail from one side and if you like it to be loose from the other side and if you like it to be firm as a rock, but the best of this swelling is that which I mentioned before
Then tighten the swelling if it is open and drain from it a little, and cover the wound with a bandage, or if it is closed leave it closed and let out its pus, then put a compress on it and hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone
And after that move your hand a little away from the eye towards the nose, so that your hand does not touch or irritate the eye, and that the compress does not slip from the eye and damage it. If you reach with your hand to the bone at the first attempt, do not put the compress again, but if you need to put it on again do so, God willing
Leave it for three days, then apply a bandage soaked in alum and cover with dried balsam until it heals. If it has not healed after forty days, apply strong medicine until the bone is exposed and its position is as described in its chapter, God willing.
As for the other method for treating fractures, which is mentioned at the beginning, it consists of cutting the fractured bone and then placing over it a splint made of material of this kind. This is its form.</start_of_turn>
And put over it a weight of lead shot mixed with gum, and bind the limb firmly with a bandage which will not move, for if you move the limb too much, the melted lead will get into the eye and cause damage. So put on the limb a soaked pad of white lead or in water.</start_of_turn>
If the lead has burned the site of the fracture and caused swelling, the fracture will be healed by means of the methods which we have mentioned previously, or other methods as will be described in their appropriate chapters.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Eighteen.</start_of_turn>
Concerning fractures of the cheek bone.</start_of_turn
It often happens that the cheekbone fractures, and it is especially common among young boys. If this fracture is treated according to what has been mentioned in the preceding section, it will not be cured. So we put a small cushion made of cotton wool on this form.</start_of_turn
It is put on the swelling then covered with a thick bandage which reaches the depth of the fracture, and it is treated with plaster until it heals, God willing.</start_of_turn
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In the management of traumatic lesions of the tongue.
If the lesion extends to the root of the tongue or the hyoid bone or to the tonsils and is soft, foul-smelling, and has increased in size, it should be excised and the wound should be closed.
So, the dressing is inserted into the wound and held with forceps until the margin reaches the point where the protecting layer has reached its limit and the other is sutured. This is done once or twice, and then the wound is treated as mentioned above until it heals, God willing
If the tissue has retracted and healed, there is no need to uncover the bone. The fractured bone should be exposed according to what will be mentioned in the following chapters, God willing.
The Twentieth Chapter
On the management of tonsillitis and relaxed tongue swelling
If the tongue is relaxed and the swelling of the tonsils has subsided, and the treatment with medicine has not been effective, place the patient’s head downwards in the basin and then apply pressure with the thumb to the area which appears after this, and put the tongue tube in place again
So, insert the dressing cautiously and hold with forceps for a while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tonsil. Then remove the forceps and repeat the process as desired. Finally, fill the mouth with salt water
He should be held for an hour and then washed with cold water, for the fractured tonsils will have become stabilized and the relaxed tongue will have become taut, thus drying up the excessive moisture.
The Twenty-fourth Chapter
The Twenty-fourth Chapter: Concerning the Tooth and Gum Disease.
If the toothache originates from cold or there is pus without treatment or medication, there is in it two faces either the swelling or the burning.
Or the swelling face is that you take barley bran and grind it to a powder then mix it with fat and apply it to the painful area and cover it with a bandage and leave it for a while.
Then you repeat the process until the fire of the tooth reaches its root. If you wish, you can put gum or linen in cold fat and put it on the tooth and cover it with a covering until the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And as for the fiery face, it is that you make a tube of alum or iron and there will be some gravel in it so that it does not reach the throat, then you put the poultice on the tooth and cover it with a dressing until the fire reaches the root of the tooth. You do this several times
Then if the pain goes away either by day or night, and after that put in the mouth of the patient some good butter and leave it for an hour and then remove it. This is the treatment for the poultice.
You may do it whichever way you like, and this is the method of the tube.</start_of_turn>
The Twenty-fourth Chapter ends here
Concerning the wisdom tooth
If the wisdom teeth are affected by pus and cold liquids but do not swell or mature with treatment, it is necessary for them to mature secretly. You should put a soft poultice on the affected area which has this appearance of being soft from both ends.</start_of_turn>
Smoke will emerge from the cavity through the other opening. Place a protection over the wound twice if necessary until it reaches the depth of the wound. If the wound is small, make an equal opening to the size of the wound.
Then leave it for three days and cover it with moist cotton wool in the meantime until the fire has passed. Then apply ointment and dressing until it heals, God willing.</start_of_turn>
The Third Section and Twenty-eighth.</start_of_turn>
In the cavity of the chest with a sound like a stifled gasp and a narrowing of the chest.</start_of_turn
If moisture has settled in the chest, especially if associated with cold temperaments, then it is necessary to evacuate the phlegm or facilitate its discharge with laxatives. Then form a compress over the nape of the neck at the root of the ribs in the lower position.</start_of_turn
Beware that the opening does not reach the windpipe and does not burn the skin except for half, then apply another compress at the nape of the neck at the end of the ribs with bleeding, and make an escharotic plaster over the part that has advanced.</start_of_turn>
Then apply ointment to what has advanced, as mentioned previously, until it heals, God willing.</start_of_turn>
The Fourth Section and Twenty-eighth.</start_of_turn
In the cavity of respiratory diseases and coughing.</start_of_turn
If coughing and respiratory disease are due to cold moisture and not due to heat and not accompanied by fever, and if the disease is chronic, then form two compresses over the supraclavicular angles and another compress in the middle of the chest between the breasts.</start_of_turn
The wound should be closed with sutures that match the size of the wound. If desired, the knots can be hidden within the wound itself. The point of the suture should be placed from three to four points towards the wound.
The wound should be closed with sutures that match the size of the wound. If desired, the knots can be hidden within the wound itself. The point of the suture should be placed from three to four points towards the wound. This is a triangular wound closure.
Chapter XXV and twenty-one.
On the skin of the thigh.
If the head of the limb is loosened by soft swelling or if it has not been secured when it is loosened, it will usually swell up again and loosen when any movement is made as I have seen with the thumb where it is necessary to secure the bone or the surrounding tissue will swell up again Then place the bandage on the back or the right side and lift the skin inside the thigh up to above with your left hand if the joint has been dislocated inwards
Then cover the wound with a triangular bandage of this size.
Then close it with sutures until the wound is healed. The wound will be triangular and there will be three sutures. The sutures will be placed at the base of the triangle and will extend towards the wound.
This is a triangular wound closure with three sutures
The number of sutures may be increased by one to make eight in total. Then fix the bone securely with wire and salt and keep the limb still until it has healed. Even if the dislocation is high up, do not move the limb too much
If there is one painful swelling or several that discharge pus, and the joint is stiff and swelling goes down, the cause is likely an abscess.
Sixth chapter and twenty-eighth.
In the abdomen.
If there is an accumulation of pus in the abdomen, due to many discharges, the patient should be put on his back, raise his legs and arms, and then apply three incisions A pocket under the armpit as much as the thumb and a marker of good feeling, and two below the flanks of the kidney until the shape of the abscess is like a triangle and there is space between them so that if they touch each other, there will be a risk of bursting. The depth of the incision should be one-third of the thickness of the skin, and the shape of the abscess should be triangular.
In this way and no more
And if you wish to open a large abscess in the middle of the abdomen, do it in this way
The marker that is on the abscess in this way is circular in shape on this image
The abdomen may discharge pus and parts of this abscess, which is that you should learn on the abdomen where you want to puncture, then make an incision there and treat the infection until it is healed
Seventh chapter and twenty-eighth
The spleen is cold
If the spleen appears and causes cold and swelling or a foul odor until it discharges naturally, this is a profuse discharge. The treatment for this is as we mentioned previously. The small finger should be placed upon the palm and three fingers should be taught on this manner, and this quantity should be done below the ribs where the ribs end.
After each finger and finger, there should be a swelling of the knuckles, and the palm should be kept straight without bending the wrist forward or backward.
The amount of pressure which should be applied should not be more than half the thickness of the skin, and the hand should be kept upright with the fingers extended, for if the hand is bent forward or backward it will be uncomfortable.
You can support these fingers on the soft tissue of the abdomen if you have compassion and experience in this industry, and this will protect the skin of the abdomen from opening and breaking, and reaching the intestines, for the skin there is thin and sensitive
The eighth and tenth ribs.
Below the ribs and the liver
If there is swelling in the liver and you are learning whether it is in the liver tissue or the peritoneum, if it is in the liver tissue it will be tough and painful without limit
If it is in the abdominal cavity it will be painful and the doctors will give treatment, so you should place your hand on the palm and learn on the warm place with the needle.
Then cover it with a burn that looks like wax, and this is the picture of it. And you keep it like this until it has healed all the skin and the ribs, and comes out of the abdomen until it has expelled all its contents, and then treat it with herbal medicine until it is healed
A type of vessel that should only be used by one who has traversed its path in the art of medicine and has experienced these diseases many times. He should then perform such work and leave it with me.
Chapter Twenty-Ninth.
On the Bottle Vessel.
I have mentioned the initial vessels with their origins from the pomegranate tree. The cold one of these is applied to this quality because it takes from the origin of the pomegranate tree a thick hair and one longer than you find in it and makes it like cloves of garlic, then submerges it in oil and boils it. Then it makes one vessel with two connections of the vein with the neck and two small ones without joints somewhat leaning towards the side under the lip and two large ones above the breasts between the third and fourth ribs
And two more between the fifth and sixth ribs leaning towards the back somewhat and one in the middle of the chest and another above the abdomen and three behind one between the shoulders and two under the armpits below the vessel which is between the elbows.
And it is not permissible to touch the vessel with your hand but rather in the outside of the skin showing respect, and some of the ancients mentioned that some people used a needle of iron like a nail to protect it and enter it between the ribs until it reaches the same swelling
And it comes out like what we mentioned concerning the swelling of the liver, and in this case it is applied with the vessel from the cavity of the abdomen either that it should die a little of its time or that it will show in the place a wound that does not heal.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
Upon the occurrence of illness.
When the disease of the abdomen is treated with what has been mentioned in the classification, it will not be cured except for three things: three compresses or four placed along the intestines.
The three compresses or four placed along the intestines should be of a size such that their breadth equals the thickness of the fingers or slightly less, and their height should be equal to the thickness of the palm of the hand.
The other side of the abdomen should be elevated and the swelling above the abdomen should be lifted where the lower rib ends and where the left lower rib ends. The skin should be raised over the width of the body so that the compresses can be placed along the body
Then insert greased sponges until they reach the skin on the other side. Then draw out the sponges and cover with another compress which has three layers of sponges.
Then the area of the intestines is treated after the swelling has subsided, and the patient is kept for a long time until the pain has subsided.
The thirty-sixth chapter.
In the condition of swelling
The treatment which we have mentioned in the classification is useful in the specific case of abdominal swelling. If the abdominal swelling is treated with other treatments besides what has been mentioned in the classification, it will not be cured. Four compresses should be placed around the tumor and one compress on the abdomen.
And another on the liver and one on the abdomen and two behind the ribcage, one above the chest and the other below the abdomen. The depth of the compresses should be close to the thickness of the skin, then leave the intestines open and allow the swelling to subside for a long time.
Do not neglect any treatment after the main procedure, but rather gather the remaining materials quickly to preserve their efficacy. The image of the poultice which relieves the back pain should be of pure gum and not resin-based.
The Second and Thirtieth Chapters.
In the foot and leg regions
If they swell in the sitting position and are filled with yellow fluid, it is necessary to apply a bandage to the back of the foot at the juncture between the phalanx and metatarsal bones
Fix your hand over the bandage without tightening it, then lift your hand and do not set it down until the yellow fluid has subsided and the bandage is of this type
Then bandage both legs from knee to ankle. The main part of the bandage should be around the calf and there should be a smaller portion below the knee and another below the ankle on each leg.
Leave the main part of the wound open without treatment for some time until it discharges its discharge. Then treat it with all that has been mentioned previously.
The Third and Thirtieth Chapters
Regarding piles
If the piles are soft and soft stools still appear despite the application of various medications and treatments to the stomach and intestines, and if you notice little benefit from these measures and the strength has decreased, then make a large incision in the abdomen to remove them. As for the progress of the abdomen wound with the four corners around the opening of the abscess, and the gum bandage surrounding the large vessel or two near the large intestine or below it
If you see moisture and swelling, and the cause is obvious, then apply a poultice to the abdomen and to each particular area. It is possible that two small ones may be applied to the stomach alongside the large one. This is a successful treatment that does not harm if God wills.
The tenth portion and thirty-third.
On the navel and every part separately.
If there is much swelling or a thick, cold clot or moisture in the cavity, and this is the cause, then do not perform the treatment mentioned previously. Apply three poultices below the loin and under the ribs a little below the navel, as mentioned previously
And apply two fingers under the skin at the hip and if you think the stomach has become cold and the food has not digested and you see the face flushed, then apply a poultice to the stomach, a large one on what has advanced and two on the abdomen. And leave the opening open for a while and then close it when the swelling has subsided, if God wills
The fifth portion and thirty-third
On the flanks
After cutting it, if you cut the vein, grasp the vessel like a curve and put your finger into the vessel until you reach the armpit where blood flows from it. Do this once or twice
If the veins are many, apply a poultice to each one as we have described, and then treat it with the appropriate medications until it subsides. If there is also a large one on the loin, do not be afraid to apply three poultices
Sixth Chapter Thirty.
In the case of patients who are sitting and their surrounding areas.
If the cause of the ailment does not necessitate incision and work in its place, then perhaps it will suffice to treat it with medication. If, however, any of the patients develops swelling or discharge from the affected area, then you must measure it with a fine probe.
Then know the quantity of the probe and then tie a ligature resembling the sensation. Insert it into the affected area parallel to the vein, and when you have inserted the amount of the probe, remove the ligature until all of the phlegmas have been expelled once or twice or thrice, as much as you need
And be cautious not to burn the nerve if there is one, or to cause excessive discharge from the area. If the patient has a large wound in the loin or in the abdomen, take care of it accordingly
Open all of these places, and if the patient is in a state of composure and you have confirmed that it is not swollen, then treat the area until it heals. If you close the area and leave the foreign matter therein, and remain quiet for a while, know that it has healed completely
And if you leave the foreign matter therein, know that it is swollen or that there is infected bone or something of the like in that place.
Seventh Chapter Thirty.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the kidney.</start_of_turn
If there is swelling and stench or a foul odor in the kidney, and if the cause of the ailment is not obvious, then you should ligate it on the same kidney as the ligature of the seminal vesicle. Perhaps three ligatures will suffice in the same space.
The Eighth Chapter of the Third Book.
On Swelling of the Testicle.
If there is swelling of the testicle and relaxation of the skin and moisture do not suffice to relieve the pain, it is necessary to make an incision below the crease of the groin where the hair begins on the groin and below the scrotum on the right and left sides.
The incision is made on either side of the penis as far as the thumb's breadth and as deep as the tip of the thumb and two if necessary. There should be a marking of sensation on what advances.
The Ninth Chapter of the Third Book.
On the Uterus
If there is material in the uterus from moisture and cold, it becomes firm and difficult to expel. If it persists there for a long time, it becomes necessary to ligate three veins around the uterus as we mentioned in the case of the testicle and make an incision below the back of the loin or two. There should be a marking of sensation on what advances
The Tenth Chapter
On Suppuration of the Hip Joint
Moisture may collect in the hip joint causing displacement of the limb and indicating that some of the bone has slipped from its place. There is an empty space in the dislocation. It is necessary to ligate the limb itself at the hip joint
after the ligature around the limb has been performed, so that the limb rests in the middle of the circle. There should be three ligatures of the large saphenous vein.
Directly apply pressure deep into the wound until the bleeding stops, God willing.
Close the wound tightly and securely.</start_of_turn>
Apply pressure to the wound.</start_of_turn>
If there is bleeding in the groin, it is due to blood clots and moisture. This necessitates excision of the minor part of the groin which has clotted and does not require treatment. Delaying treatment will only exacerbate the bleeding.</start_of_turn>
Then, compress the wound and apply pressure on it with two fingers or medicinal poultices or with mustard plaster and the like, so that the pressure applied on the wound itself is three fingers thick as in this case.</start_of_turn
And keep pressure on it steadily and moderately with every alternate finger and over a distance of four fingers, and put a pad of lint over the wound itself and put over it another pad of lint of the size of four fingers, and if you wish, you can remove one of the fingers from the pressure.</start_of_turn
So as to encompass the whole of the groin and cover the thickness of the skin, this is the way of treatment for the pain of the groin which does not extend to the thigh and the leg.</start_of_turn
And if it extends to the thigh and leg, remove two fingers from the groin over the area where the pain originates and put a pad of lint over the crease of the hip bone to the knee with four fingers, and the depth of the wound should be equal to the thickness of the skin only.</start_of_turn
And if it extends to the knee joint, remove three or four fingers from the groin and put pressure on the area where the pain originates with three or four fingers, and if the pain is in the thigh towards the leg, remove one pad from the pressure.</start_of_turn
Beware in all your practices that you do not reach the point where you burn the fascia or nerve excessively, lest you cause damage to the surrounding tissue or delay the healing process.

Then she is let down upon the right hip and the lesser trochanter is grasped with the left hand and the hand is elevated. Then water is poured between the two circlets, and it is covered with a bandage and an aromatic substance. It is held for an hour and a quarter, and the lesser trochanter is patient with the pain and the burning. If he finds pain like fire, he has found his remedy.
Then she is let down upon the right hip and the lesser trochanter is grasped with the left hand and her hand is elevated. Then water is poured over the hip all around with fresh water and it is covered with an aromatic substance. It is left for three days and is covered with ointment until the burn disappears and there is discharge from it.
Then it is treated with liniment until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, he says: "This is what the water does when it is applied to the hip." This is the property of strong water and it has been proved in the section on medicinal preparations
She takes from the salt of the barley and from the gypsum, unburnt from each one a part and puts them into a new vessel that has a small hole at the bottom. She puts under the bottom of the vessel another vessel containing another mixture.
She pours water over the barley and gypsum what covers them with the fingers. She grasps them with her hand and elevates them. She leaves the vessel until the strong water has gone down to the bottom of the vessel. She collects all the water and pours it over another vessel of barley and gypsum again.
If it is like this, the limit of heat will be found in many works of medicine and concerning all the members, because it does the work of fire in itself. And among the medicines that are useful for the hip are saffron, honey, gypsum with soap mixed with them.
Galenus reported that an ancient physician once treated a dislocation of the hip, swelling of the knee and enlargement of the thigh. He claimed that no other treatment was necessary and that it healed in one instance.

If cold matter is administered and the excess is evacuated with love and attention, it should be applied to the back where the pain is, in three rows over the width of the abdomen. After the position has been learned with the needle in every row, five keys or more should be applied according to the probability of the cause and its strength.
The key should be applied to the point [of pain] if you wish. Three keys or four keys with an intermediate needle may be applied on this image.
The third part and the following.
The key at the beginning of the wound
It is often seen in children and is a sign of its early onset that there is psychological distress when doing it and movement, and that there is a wrinkle on the lower back that extends over the rest of the scars
If you see it and want to stop it, make a circle on this image. To take the key on all sides of the vertebra, including the back, and if you wish, to apply it around the vertebra with a circular needle. Make the needle points close to each other, and then treat the position until the pain disappears as mentioned above
And preserve that the key is used in a wound that is caused by stretching the nerve.
The fourth part and the following
In the key of the fracture and the joints pain
If the pains of the joints are from cold moisture that is administered to any part of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, it is usually called a special fracture.
If the cold abscess persists despite treatment as described previously, the physician should perform an incision around the knee joint. Many small incisions should be made, and the area should be infiltrated with moderate amounts of oil.
If an incision is required on the face of a man, make a point-blank incision, for the pain often ascends to the knee-joints or other joints. Many incisions are usually made on each leg, with this oil infiltration in each.
If further incision is necessary, do not grasp the limb tightly but only grasp the skin, for if the pain ascends to the groin or back, repeat the incision as described previously
If the pain is only in the hands, make an incision around the knuckles as for two rows of beads, and if the pain persists in the fingers, make incisions at each joint and at the base of the thumb. If the pain later ascends to the forearm or upper arm.
Make incisions from all sides and do not neglect to apply poultices and medications. If food improves and vomiting ceases, this will be beneficial with this treatment, God willing.
The excerpt concludes here.
The excerpt concludes with "In the name of God.
If there is a wound in the abdomen and some intestines have protruded to the outside and it is early in the process, order the patient to abstain from eating on that day and to take laxatives that will expel the feces from his belly
Then place your hands between his shoulder blades and order him to strain until the feces or intestine is expelled through your fingers. Then teach him to use the enema under the wound on the rib cage, as if it were half a circle with its ends towards the upper part of the body
Then protect the area surrounding this shape.
Then until white comes out, it will remove the gut and put it in its belly, and a servant will hold his hand over the place so that it does not protrude and has not escaped between the two thighs. It will place a cushion under it and another servant will tie it over his thighs.
And another one will grasp his hands and the area surrounding the mark will be placed on the mark itself and his hand will be fixed on the area and will not be moved until it reaches the bone or is brought back once more if it has not reached the bone the first time
And preserve your effort from the protrusion of the gut, while you are holding his hand lest you should tear it in the process of healing or cause him great pain, and know that if you do not reach the bone with your attempt, your work has not been successful and it is better for the young ones to be given a soft cushion for their legs and for the old ones a hard cushion for their legs.
Then treat the place after three or four days of rest until the swelling of the fire has gone down, and then treat it with all the ointments until it is healed and the thigh is relaxed on his back for forty days until the wound is healed.
And you should make his food during his treatment soft so that it does not cause the gut to protrude when he moves and when he burps. And if he wants to do anything after forty days, you should use a bandage to tie it and keep it bound for forty days and reduce the movement of food and drink and the shouting of laughter.
And if you do this treatment in this way, praise be to God, and I will remind you of the treatment of the wound in the armpit in his book, praise be to God. As for the wound which happens in all the belly and is new, if you wish that it should not increase in size, do not make its treatment severe on him on his capacity Injuries to the skin should not extend beyond a third of the affected area. As for what has been mentioned previously, if God wills, it will not exceed this. Some of the early scholars have related that a burn may be remedied with a patch like that which is described in this image.
After you have learned about incision with the needle and have made a line at the upper end of the incision and another line at the lower end, and you insert your hand in the middle with a clamp, the first is easiest and best if God wills.

If there is bleeding in some of the organs due to a cut or injury and the blood continues to flow for a long time without stopping, despite treatment and medication, then it is necessary to cauterize the point of bleeding and do so according to the size, position and strength of the organ.</start_of_turn
And it is possible that the pain and swelling will subside from the first degree and will not return to it again, for it is usual for these pains to spread from the organ to what is nearby, so you must follow them until the cause is eliminated.</start_of_turn

Two are on the corners and one behind on the cartilage. Keep your hand steady and slightly tense until it reaches the bone, as its effect will be gradual.
The unit will remove scales that do not facilitate the escape of thick vapor from it and will form a cavity also on the same side of the head as it advances. If the tumor has persisted for a long time and appeared externally, it is necessary to form these cavities which we mentioned in the head A cavity is on the side of the nose and two on the cheeks and two on the cervical vertebrae and two on the thoracic vertebrae and one large one on the scapula and another above it in the same line and two on the lips on each side and one in the middle of the chin. Two are on the ankles, one on each ankle, two on the knees, two on the elbows, two on the shoulders, two on the collarbones and two on the thumbs and toes and one on each heel of the foot and ankle
Be careful of the sciatic nerve which is behind the heel bones so that you do not damage it. There may be a cavity on the bone of the loin and another on the stomach and another on the liver. Know that the more cavities you make, the more effective and beneficial it will be.
Note that excessive force will not benefit the hand and may cause damage. The size of the incision should be appropriate for the organs and joints as they progress in stature.
Then treat the cavity meticulously with the needle and thread and all treatment until it is healed, God willing.

Then evacuate it from all sides until the pus has drained completely. Then leave it for three days and apply a paste of powdered potassium iodide with oil until the wound has healed.</start_of_turn

Chapter Fifty-three.
Regarding the reversed and non-reversed procedures of incisions.
It is common in the feet of these people that this wisdom occurs, and it is a harsh thing that teaches men, and in it is upon two faces either cutting with the knife or with water that boils over
Or as for cutting with water that boils over, it is that it should cover the wound with soft wool and place over it a wet cloth that is boiled until it becomes soft, then place the wet cloth over the wound and rotate the wool around the wound until the wool reaches the depth of the wound
And leave it for three days, then cover it with powdered charcoal mixed with salt and leave the dressing on for a night. When it is taken off, it will have drained from its source. Then treat the wound with unguents until it is healed, if the incisions are not reversed
It is common on the surface of the body, and especially on the hands and feet, that one should take a tube of lead or iron or from the bristles of a brush and pass it over the wound or fistula, and then pour into the tube a quantity of boiling water.
Grasp your hand and rotate your wrist slightly so that the tube's margin reaches the root of the suture or fistula, and wait patiently a little for the boiling water to penetrate the root of the suture or fistula.
Then leave it, and if the suture comes loose from its source, so be it. Do this one by one until you have done all of them, and then treat the remaining parts with ointments after they have drained from their source.

If any foreign body has entered the vein from the foot or from the hip or from something else, then it must be removed by making four or five incisions between each two incisions and at the front there must be an incision.

It often happens that bleeding occurs from a vessel that has been cut due to an injury that is exposed from outside or at the root of a swelling or a part of an organ and so on.
If any of these occur, grasp your hand quickly to the orifice of the artery and place your thumb there to impede the flow of blood until it is confined beneath your thumb. Then place some small and large pieces of lint on the fire and burn them until they are consumed.
Then take one [lint] either small or large according to the wound and its location. Put it on the same vein after you remove your thumb and secure the lint until the blood is cut off.</start_of_turn>
If, when you raise your thumb from the orifice of the artery, the bleeding continues, put another lint on the vein immediately from the pieces which you burnt in the fire. Continue doing this until the bleeding stops.</start_of_turn>
And keep your hand cool, for if there is any other bleeding, know that the artery will not clot and will not stop bleeding, especially if the artery is large, except for one of its four faces, or by ligation as we mentioned before, or by cutting off the supply of blood.</start_of_turn> If it is cut, its two ends will contract and the blood will stop flowing. Or tie it off with sutures and tighten. Or put on it medications that will stop the bleeding and tighten the edges.</start_of_turn>
And whoever attempts to cut it off with a suture or by tightening it with a clamp or putting in burning things and the like. It will not stop the bleeding except at the wound. If its width has not been reduced by a physician or medication, then it is best to put your thumb on the orifice of the wound itself as we described.</start_of_turn>
And tighten it firmly until the blood is confined beneath the thumb and does not emerge from above the wound or the artery. The cold water should be used always, for it will freeze the blood and thicken and stop it from bleeding.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Two.
On Incisions, Abscesses, and Surgery Therein.
As we mentioned in the previous chapter, diseases that necessitate surgery include fractures, burns, wound infections, and various ailments. Their treatment involves excision, cauterization, medication, and dressing changes. This has been elaborated upon in several sections of this century-old book
And in this chapter, we elaborate on the aforementioned approach without further elaboration...
Before proceeding further, it is worth noting that what is contained in this chapter surpasses the knowledge found in the previous chapters regarding these matters.
Given the extensive knowledge encompassed in this chapter concerning incisions, abscesses, and surgical procedures, it is advisable to approach the subject matter with utmost caution. Many procedures mentioned in this chapter involve bleeding, which poses a significant risk to life when performing surgery on organs such as veins, abscesses, tumors, or joints. This necessitates meticulous attention and necessitates great care to minimize potential harm and ensure patient safety.
I urge you to exercise extreme caution in your pursuit of knowledge concerning this field, as there exists a significant risk of harm and potential death associated with the procedures outlined in this chapter. Many individuals have perished due to complications arising from such practices.
Given the great danger involved in the procedures described in this chapter, which often lead to death due to excessive bleeding and underlying health conditions, it is strongly advised against attempting them. Many individuals have tragically lost their lives due to such reckless practices. Do not be lured by promises of miraculous healing or exaggerated claims of health benefits.
Therefore, exercise extreme caution and prioritize safety over any desire for healing. Seek knowledge from reliable sources and prioritize safety in all your medical endeavors.
May Allah aid you in acquiring praise, glory, and remembrance, and grant you success and providence.
I have compiled this chapter from sections dealing with the issue of the kidney from the tenth century AD book on surgery by Albucasis, so that you will not have to go through all that material if you do not wish to
The First Chapter
Concerning the treatment of water that accumulates in the heads of young children
This ailment often occurs among newborns when the fontanelle of the head is pressed too tightly and can also be caused by some unknown cause
I have not observed this ailment in anyone other than newborns, and among those I have seen, some died immediately and others gradually grew better. Until the child is able to sit up on its own and the swelling subsides, which may take until its death
Or it collects under the skin and within the abdominal cavity. The work in this case is that if the swelling is small, a small incision should be made in the middle of the head and the fluid should be drained out. This is like making a puncture wound about two finger-widths long.</start_of_turn>
If the swelling is large, make two intersecting incisions like this.</start_of_turn>
If the swelling is under the skin and you see the sutures of the head open from all sides, and the fluid diminishes when you press your hand over it, do not be hasty and open three incisions like this.</start_of_turn
After the incision, all the humors evacuate and the edges are closed with silk thread and sponges. It is then extracted from above with wine and oil until the fifth day. The ligature is then severed and the wound is treated with lancets and plasters. The head tension is not to be neglected and all food should be dry and little in humors.
Until the limb is healed and the wound has closed, another incision is described to look where the swelling of the bone appears and the water has gathered, as it may be more in the back or front or right or left side of the head
The incision is made where the swelling of the bone appears and the water is gathered. The bone is split open on what can be preserved without cutting any arteries, causing some bleeding which is stopped by vomiting of humors
Second incision.
Cutting the two arteries known as the posterior and anterior ethmoid arteries
When a severe nasal bleed occurs in the eye or chest and treatment with medications has not been successful, it is reported in this case that cutting these two arteries is necessary
If you wish to cut them, you should first put the head in the basin, then mark the area with a burn or indelible ink where the artery is located. Then tie the thread tightly around the neck of the limb and look where the sweat and the two places that are behind the ears are and little of what is under that is not covered by the eye.
Then you will learn about them with the needle and then cut them. The cutting will be made on the bone and if you wish you can put a plug under the artery and extract it with the cutting. The length of the cutting will be about two fingers wide.
If the vein has been severed and blood is spurting profusely, do not attempt to close it at the origin. Rather, place the thumb and index finger behind the pulse and learn by trial and error where the artery is. Then, using the needle and thread, pierce through the bone.

Third section.
Regarding the two arteries in the fingers
If a vein has been severed and blood is spurting profusely, do not attempt to close it at its origin. Rather, place the thumb and index finger behind the pulse and learn by trial and error where the artery is. Then, using the needle and thread, pierce through the bone.
Regarding the two arteries in the fingers. If a vein has been severed and blood is spurting profusely, do not attempt to close it at its origin. Rather, place the thumb and index finger behind the pulse and learn by trial and error where the artery is. Then, using the needle and thread, pierce through the bone. And direct the work in shaving the hair of the fingers and cutting the visible artery in the palm if you can see its pulse and its quantity in people.
Or when the cold is severe and you do not see it directly, tighten the dressing with praise until you feel the warmth of the pulse, then prick with the needle or make a hole with a hot needle until the artery appears clearly Then you take the part which is under these images. Then you peel it to the skin and uncover until you reach the artery, then you insert the cautery into it and grasp it upwards until you draw it out through the skin and remove it from the fatty layers underneath from all sides. If the artery is large, you twist the cautery at the tip of the vessel. Then you cut off a part of it as much as its two ends are distant and grasp it tightly without causing any bleeding. If it has not been cut off and is still intact, there will be no bleeding. Then you drain the blood from six to three holes.</start_of_turn>
If the artery is large, then you should ligate it in two places with a strong suture. The suture may be of silk or gut. If not, it will accelerate clotting before the wound is healed, causing bleeding.</start_of_turn>
Then you cut off the remaining part between the ligatures. This is done at that moment or later. If you wish, you can fix it to the bone with a callous hook until its ends are fractured, which is the same as doing it in this way or better as we have said.</start_of_turn>
Otherwise, if there is swelling or congestion of the temperament because the kidney is somewhat obstructed, it is certain that the evacuation of humours will be useful. After you have ligated the two arteries, you should fill the place with cotton wool and apply a tight dressing. After that, you should apply an ointment of lard and alum to the wound until it heals if God wills.</start_of_turn>
If, during your work, there is bleeding from the artery, do not delay. Either cut off the part or fill the place with cautery and clamp your hand until the bleeding stops. If this does not work, put your finger on the bleeding until the blood clots.</start_of_turn>
Cool the affected area with strong cold water until the sensation subsides and the tissue becomes taut. The most beneficial method is to apply an ointment composed of two needles after the affected parts have been rendered insensible by the cauterization.
Cool the area until the sensation disappears and the tissue becomes taut. Apply an ointment composed of two needles to the two points once the area has become insensible
The needles are like two small pins, but they are less sharp than usual because if they were too sharp, the cold would not stop the bleeding quickly enough, and if there is any clot or inflammation the fire would be hindered.
The bleeding stops quickly, which is better than any other method and is the lightest and easiest, but there must be some space between the needles as much as possible.
Space between the needles is required.
For the treatment of persistent bleeding from two holes in the eye
When bleeding is continuous and the source is the arteries at the back of the head, outside the eye, and nothing has helped to stop it by medical or pharmaceutical means, I have seen the face of the sufferer become pale. And I saw in his face a faint tremor like the buzzing of a bee and his eyes wide with fear, for I had heard that this method is used for treating such bleeding.
Then three parallel incisions were made on the brow, each as long as the nose, and the middle one was at the level of the eyebrows and the others below.
The preservation of the two arteries located between the thumb and the index finger and beyond the wrist is essential. After every incision, there should be three included fingers of support. But with respect to the sponge and its variations, or the breaking of the scaphoid bone, many things which may cause bleeding are left unsaid.
Then the needle enters at the base of the thumb and index finger as this image shows. From the incision at the elbow to the middle incision and all the skin between the incisions with the periosteum over the bone, and do this also from the middle incision to the third incision, and then withdraw the needle. And also enter in the first incision another instrument called a scapel sharp from one side and a blunt needle from the other side and this is the image
The sharp side of the scapel is directed upwards towards the fatty tissue covering the skin, and the blunt side is directed towards the bone and is pushed until it reaches the middle incision and cuts through all the blood vessels that descend from the head to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin
Do this also from the middle incision to the third incision, and after bleeding has ceased place a compress over the incision and apply over it a pad of cotton wool soaked in oil or resin or fat and oil.
So that no swelling appears today on the third day, and use plenty of cold water, and treat with balsam and henna and all that is used for wounds until it heals if God wills it.
Chapter five.
In the treatment of bleeding and the discharge from the eyes from the inside of the head.
When a person living in a crowded place experiences a severe injury that causes permanent paralysis and their eyes are fixed and small, and their vision is weak and their nose and lips are swollen, and mucus drips from them. When the head is deep and the pain is severe and continuous, know that this is from many large blood vessels that are obstructed. The best treatment for this is to cauterize the edge of the jaw and make a single incision in the middle of the jaw.
When the head is deep and the pain is severe and continuous, know that this is from many large blood vessels that are obstructed. The best treatment for this is to cauterize the edge of the jaw and make a single incision in the middle of the jaw. Or raise the area slightly and make an incision from the left zygomatic bone to the right zygomatic bone. The incision should reach the bone and extend beyond the movable parts of the jaw until the bone is exposed and all the blood vessels are divided
Separate the edges of the incision with cotton wool or a piece of gut and then suture from above with silk thread and tie the knots with wine and oil so that no swelling occurs. When the knots are removed and you see that the swelling has gone down, know that the swelling has been overcome and that it is permissible to move the bone until fat begins to grow
Then treat it with dry dressing that promotes fat growth like taking two parts of barley flour and four parts of wool grease and applying it to the wound.
Sixth Chapter.
On treating what falls into the ear.
There are four kinds of what falls into the ear: either a metallic or stony object like iron or glass, or a botanical substance such as hemp or acacia, or something liquid such as water or vinegar, and the like.
If an animal is alive, when it falls into the ear, a piece of gravel or any foreign body that does not rise in the ear should be left alone. If you see the gravel only, put something soft in the ear such as fat or ointment and then try to expel it by shaking the head or pressing the earlobe. If the ear canal is blocked after putting a plug of cotton or wool around the ear, and after stretching the ear upwards as much as possible, if the obstruction does not come out, attempt to remove it with gentle probing as shown in this illustration
If it comes out with the forceps, well and good. If not, try to remove it with a thin needle or hook, without causing excessive bending. If it still does not come out, make a tube of gutta and insert one end of the tube into the ear hole.
Close the surrounding area of the tube with fat to prevent air from passing through, then pull the tube strongly and steadily until it comes out. If it still does not come out despite these measures, take a needle or thread and pass it through the tube and tie it at the end that is outside the ear
After tying it securely, insert it into the ear hole after drying the ear, if it still does not come out despite all of this, seek surgical intervention before the swelling or pain occurs.
The incision should be made slightly higher up and the opening should be drained of blood as much as possible. Then sit with your ears up and make an incision at the base of the ear at the lowest point.
The incision is crescent-shaped until it reaches the gravel, then grasp it with the instruments available and remove it as quickly as possible. Then close the incision with stitches as soon as possible and treat the wound until it heals
If any foreign object is lodged in the ear from one of the medications that causes swelling, attempt to expel it as we have mentioned. If that is not possible, take a gentle pinch at the edge of the image.
Attempt to remove the type of medication that has fallen into the ear, as previously mentioned. Do so only if you are confident that the medication has solidified and become small pieces that can be expelled through the eardrum or by gentle pressure or withdrawal
As previously mentioned, it is easier to expel the medication when it is softened. If water has entered the ear, add a little astringent to the ointment or fill the ear with cotton wool, which will cause the ear to swell and expel the medication
Do not take large portions of ointment at a time and apply it thickly. Wet a little of it and put a little in the ear. Close the ear with the thumb and index finger of the hand that is not holding the ointment and strike the ear with the thumb of the other hand.
Do not keep pressing until all the water is expelled. Some water may remain in the ear and a little chill or breeze may be applied to one side of the ear and the other side is closed with the thumb and index finger and struck with the thumb of the other hand. Repeat this until the water is expelled and some of the chill has gone out of the ear
Repeat the process until all the water has been expelled or until it is driven out through a tube. If there is a small animal inside the ear, such as a flea, grasp it actively as mentioned previously and do not irritate the ear any more.
If the animal is large, it is better to grasp it and remove it with tweezers or other instruments. It is easier to do this than to irritate the ear in other ways. If the worm that has been treated as mentioned previously persists, there is no need to repeat the treatment.
If you look at the ear in the sunlight and you see anything moving, extract it with forceps or cotton swabs. If you do not see anything, take out the tube [earwax].
If you look at the ear in the sunlight and you see anything moving, extract it with forceps or cotton swabs. If you do not see anything, take out the earwax tube.
If the worms do not emerge as mentioned previously, use these drops that we mentioned earlier. They will kill the worms and you will find this in the drops section. Mix these drops with water in the ear and this is its form.
You also make it from pounded silver or a tight copper tube with a small hole at the bottom and a wide hole at the top. If you wish, the dose which is in the body of the tube may be made of copper. If you wish, take a spoonful of oil and wrap a bandage around the end of it.
Then apply oil, vinegar or whatever of these medicines you like into the ear and insert the tube with the bandage from above and press down firmly until the oil is expelled from the ear canal and the pain subsides.
Therefore, whatever is inside the ear will either be softened by the oil or will be expelled by the vinegar or the like. Do not be afraid that it is hot or cold, for the ear cannot tolerate either
Seventh Chapter.
On the treatment of earwax obstruction.</start_of_turn>
Some children expel their earwax from their mothers' wombs and their ears without difficulty.</start_of_turn
Sometimes people suffer blockages within the ear canal due to injury or swelling, and this blockage may be deep within the ear canal and beyond visual inspection.
Sometimes people experience blockages within the ear canal due to injury or swelling, which may be located deep within the ear canal and thus escapes visual detection. And if you see the blockage only at the opening of the ear canal, then open it with a gentle touch.
The outer portion may show some extent of exposure, but most of the blockage lies deep within the ear canal and cannot be seen. In such a case, one should apply a soft touch to open it up. If the blockage is due to swelling of tissue, it should be separated from the surrounding area by gentle traction until all the tissue is removed
If the blockage is deep within the ear canal, grasp a soft probe cautiously and pull it out slowly while applying pressure, until you feel the blockage along with any accompanying discomfort or loss of hearing.
And preserve the eardrum from being punctured, then pull the drum membrane outwards without tension until the size of the opening has been restored. This can be done at any time until the wound has healed or until a hole has been made and closed with a powdered dressing
Or if you see that the ear is swollen and inflamed, make an opening and replace it with another tube which has been moistened by broth until the swelling subsides. Then treat the wound as usual until it heals
If blood appears, soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear. Use all the treatments mentioned in the preceding sections to stop the bleeding.
Chapter Eight.
In the treatment of wounds that occur in the chest.
These wounds which appear in the chest may be bloody and cause pain, so it is necessary to grasp them with forceps or sutures and cut them from their roots. Then support them with powdered sulfur on the surrounding area.
If there is bleeding from them, tie a tight ligature around the vessel and leave it for a while. It will be better after cutting and more bleeding will not occur if some of the root remains. If the fire burns those roots, they will no longer exist
Chapter Nine.
In the treatment of abscesses in the chest of the eye
There is often something resembling a cold in intensity and swelling in the chest of the eye
This is called an abscess, which is a gathering of thick pus in the upper and lower eyelids, causing them to swell outwards.
Then drain them from every side until they are empty, then suture them and cut them off. If you do not cut them off after they have drained, it will not cause any harm. But if the incision is large, gather it with sutures and treat it until it heals
And if it is small, it is not necessary to cut it off. If the abscess is directed inwards towards the inner surface of the eye, do not open the abscess but suture the abscess from the outside without cutting
For if the eye is opened by cutting, this will not cause any harm. Then wash the eye after cutting the abscess with salt water and treat the surrounding area until it heals
Chapter Ten.
In the treatment of ailments affecting the nasal cavity that manifest in the eyes.
The nasal cavity is a swelling that exists in the upper layers of the eye and is more prevalent among children. It causes their eyes to become heavy and causes them to discharge pus in the mornings, making them unable to see the sunlight. To accelerate the discharge of the mucus
When they rest their faces on their hands and sleep with their eyes covered by wet patches of moisture that may have come from their tears, and when their fingers touch the swelling between their eyes, they will feel the swelling of the nasal cavity
Then take a piece of cotton and wring it out, make a loop from it and put it on the swelling from all sides, and then put it on the swelling and press on it from all sides to collect the swelling in the center
Then make a cut in the middle of that moist area with a knife that is not wider than the incision in the palm of your hand and as deep as necessary so that the skin of the entire area is split until it reaches the swelling.
In most cases, the swelling of the nasal cavity will come out through the cut like a piece of white fat. Grab it with a bandage that you have wound around your fingers until it comes out outside. While you are doing that, keep your hand steady and level. Be careful not to widen the incision too much, otherwise the eyeball will be damaged
If the swelling of the nasal cavity does not come out through the first incision, it is necessary to widen the incision slightly and wait until the swelling comes out. Then grab it as we mentioned before and cover the wound with a bandage and water. Press on it until it is firmly in place, and from among the people who are skilled in this there are some who mix salt.
He will place it in the belly of the incision to absorb what remains of the moisture, and then he will treat it until it is painless, even if it develops inflammation and swelling in the place.
Chapter Ten.
In the area of the eye socket.
If it is applied to the eye socket, it will secrete like ordinary mucus under normal circumstances, and if it remains for a long time, it will cause inflammation of the eye and its surrounding area, leading to discharge from the eye, swelling, and itching, until the eye becomes blind
It can be applied to four faces: with the brush or needle, or with a strong medicine on the wound, or by cutting and stitching, or by pressing on what is causing the pain
It is necessary to keep the head of the eye low and then turn the eye socket with your left hand, and if you turn it or if there is a needle in it, insert a thread from below the eye socket and pass the needle from above, and this will be close to the hair itself and you will pull the thread up to the top of the eye socket
Then move it to the root and puncture in the belly of the eye socket without the hair of the plucked area, and then close the wound with silk thread from the greater to the lesser puncture, and then tighten the thread under the skin around a small piece of cotton or foreign body, and then cover the eye
Like the shape of a sheet of paper, except that it is necessary to make the shape as much as you want to lift the eye socket because people are different and some of them may need to cut more of the eye socket than others depending on how much the eye socket is relaxed
Among them are those who require less of the cutting. All of that is upon the extent of relaxation of the eyelids. Then make the incision on two lines which you have been taught. Begin from the larger aperture to the smaller one. The incision should be close to the natural hair line like the thickness of the pupil.
Then insert the needle into one of the corners of the skin and then pass it through all of it. Then gather the edges together with a fine needle and silk thread. Hemostasis should be achieved by pressing and by applying some absorbent materials. Fasten the remaining stitches on the bridge of the nose with some bulky substances.</start_of_turn>
Do it like this, and if not, it does not matter. Leave the stitches and the thread in for about three or four days, and then treat it. If you wish, leave the wound unstitched and treat it with something that absorbs and contracts. The eyelid will rise when the wound is closed and the sutures are removed. It is better to leave the suture and treat it with something that absorbs and contracts.</start_of_turn>
Thus the face from the swelling mentioned earlier, except that there is some support for the reason. This is from the quality of the work and there is no risk in it. The other face in the swelling is also like that of a piece of paper as we have described.</start_of_turn> Then raise the eyelid in three pinches, which are separated or gathered in this fashion.</start_of_turn>
Then cut the remaining eyelid with a small scissors in this fashion, cutting in moderation.</start_of_turn
If you are unable to grasp the pinches and it does not please you, take a needle and thread and pass it through the middle of the shape and pass another thread close to the larger aperture and another thread close to the smaller one. Gather the threads together with moderation. Then lift the edges with your hand lifting upwards moderately.</start_of_turn>
Perfume the wound liberally with what we have described previously, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat until healed. If there is swelling or a lump at the site of your incision or wound, evacuate that swelling with curettage and soften it with soothing substances.
The lower abdomen may also swell, so use what we have mentioned of excision, sutures, cautery, and medication for the pain, or medication for the pain and make the incision less painful and tighten the sutures and excisions as much as possible.
The incision should be closed with sutures in such a way that the edges of the wound are approximated and the underlying tissue is not injured.
The sutures should be placed in the extremities of both layers of the skin, and the edges should be approximated with tension and care, leaving any excess tissue that might cause tension or infection.
Until it heals, if you notice swelling of the wound and it has not closed, remove the dressing and treat until healed. If the swelling persists and the edges of the wound are still gaping, make two small incisions and close them with sutures of an appropriate size and length for the width and depth of the wound
Chapter 22.
In the elevation of soft hair from the eye of the needle.
If there are hairs or two in the work, take a fine needle and pass a silken thread through it and tie a knot at one end, leaving the length of the thread towards the tip of the hair
Then put the loop of thread over the hair root and bring the needle back through the base of the hair without damaging the surrounding skin.
The thread is drawn through the eye of the needle urgently and is passed out from above the natural hair, then the thread is grasped above the knots and enters the knots themselves with the hair if it is one or two or three at most.
Then the hand grasps it until the hair comes out with the knots in the eye of the needle with the natural hair, and if the knots did not come out with the hair, the knots are grasped by the thread until they come out from the higher opening.</start_of_turn>
Then the hair is drawn out again and grasped, and this is done until the eye of the needle is raised in the higher opening and is seen by the eye, and when that happens the knots and the thread are removed from the eye and the eye is closed and left closed for two or three days until the hair returns to its place and the surrounding tissue heals.</start_of_turn>
If the hair is short, either add some long hair from the natural hair and draw it out with it, or leave it until it grows, and when it has grown, raise it up.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of the wound in the upper part of the eye.
The wound which is exposed to this infection is called a corneal ulcer and it is either natural or traumatic. The traumatic one is from the infiltration of a foreign body such as glass or a piece of metal, or as a result of an injury.</start_of_turn>
The work in this case is to dissect that infiltration and separate its edges, and to make a tunnel from silk and tie it until it heals, and it is not permissible to use anything that may dry or tighten.</start_of_turn
If you do that, you will return the patient with more damage than before, using things that worsen the condition like bands, tourniquets with blood clotted in them, and ointment of diaorrhoea.
There is no known cure that does not cause some harm to the body, and this work that we mentioned only brings some restoration to the condition, but does not return the body to the state it was before.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Fourteen.</start_of_turn>
In the treatment of a wound that is in the lower eyelid.</start_of_turn>
This wound is one of the most severe called 'haqiqah strah' which is natural and its width is from a perforation or tear or something like that.</start_of_turn
The way to do the work is that you take a needle with a strong suture and pass it through the meat and pass it from the inner angle to the outer angle until the suture becomes tight in both ends, then you expand the meat above the needle and cut it with a wide knife.</start_of_turn
If you return the shape of the eyelid to what is desirable, otherwise you take a pledget and put it on the site of the cut and turn it inwards and make two incisions from the inside of the eyelid and the ends of the incisions are from the corners of the cutting that was made until they meet, and from this there is a triangle.</start_of_turn Until when it gets together it becomes like this shape.</start_of_turn
And it is the Greek letter lambda, then you remove that piece of meat as much as is below the edge which is towards the eyelid, then you gather the scattered parts with two sutures and tie it with a thread of wool, and then you treat it with what we mentioned of soothing medications and the dressing until it heals.</start_of_turn
If the wound is wide or has edges that need to be approximated, or if there is a hanging flap of tissue, a simple incision without undermining surrounding hair should be made. Then, the edges should be separated with a separation suture.
If the wound is from above or below, work should be done according to the nature of the wound. There are many variations in appearance, and the surgeon must be skilled in any method available.
Until the wound returns to its natural shape or comes close to it, the disease will tell you what is appropriate for it in terms of work and instruments in most cases
Fifth section.
In the adhesion of the eye-lids to the conjunctiva or the cornea.
This adhesion may present many people with the situation where the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, hindering its normal movements and activities. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a sub-ocular incision
It should be raised above or stretched with forceps, and then the adhesion should be severed with a fine needle that does not cause excessive bleeding, as it should be done cautiously to avoid causing damage to the eye during work.
The adhesion is resolved only when the eyelid returns to its natural position and the adhesion is completely eliminated. Sometimes, after this, a salty tear will flow from the eye or there will be bleeding from the veins. Then, separation of the eyelid from the eye should be performed using a silk suture
A wet compress is placed over the eye and after three days, fine sutures are used until healing is complete
Chapter XVI.
On the cutting of veins and the tying of arteries.
Veins are either pulsating or non-pulsating. Pulsating veins are like solid fat veins, while non-pulsating veins are like solid blood clots filled with iron or lead. Take hold of the vein with forceps and cut it off
Neither of these two types of veins should be cut without holding them firmly. The larger the vein, the more force should be used to grasp and cut it. The work of cutting the vein should be done slowly from the root towards the tip, so as not to damage the eye or move the eye socket, or cause any other injury
Then open the eye and raise the eyelid with your hand. Grasp the vein with forceps and stretch it upwards. Insert a needle and pass a hair of horsehair or a piece of strong thread through the vein and tie the knot securely at the centre of the vein.
The needle should be passed through the vein and the knot should be secured with the thread. Stretch the vein upwards and cut off the remaining part of the vein at the root with a slight pressure or a small scissor and leave the natural tissue of the vein intact
To prevent bleeding from the incision, the vein can be stretched with the forceps alone or with the thread as we mentioned above, and then be secured with a tight ligature at the desired point.
Care must be taken that the ligature does not touch the cornea during ligation, as this may cause pain and swelling, and after cutting the vein, put some powdered salt or zinger in the eye and leave it for a while, then treat it as needed until it heals completely.
If the wound is not nervous and does not permit the insertion of a needle or the holding of a cautery, then many things are beyond the power of drugs to remedy this type of wound. It should be left as described in the classification, and if you wish to cut it open, do so cautiously.
Take tweezers that are dull and weak and gently grasp the edges of this kind of wound And remove the wound from above the navel gently, for if you see that it is deep and will break and leave only the fat behind, then keep your hand away from the wound for a while from the zangari seed or the red seed or powdered salt and press the eye until tomorrow.
Then do the work again until it is all gone, except if there is an inflamed tumor in the eye. Leave the tumor and treat the inflammation until it heals, then do the work again until it heals, and do not touch the fat tissue around the wound
If it is the fat that is causing the pain, do not cut it away with the cautery. Cut away some of the fat and do not worry about cutting too much, for if you do there will be bleeding, and then pour some of the red seed or zangari seed or powdered salt into the wound until it heals.
The Seventeenth Chapter.
On the cutting of varicose veins and what comes out of excess fat in the eye.
Some people have red fat that grows in their eyes until it covers the pupil or approaches or extends over the eyelashes, and perhaps the eyelashes turn outwards like the grapes of the vine
And the work is to put the little finger over your cheek and open the eye and grasp that red fat with the forceps according to that
If the tissue is still tough, grasp it firmly and cut through the first layer of fat until all of it is severed. Preserve the eye from damage during this process. The cut should be either as described in the section on cutting fatty tissue or as a small incision. If the tissue is still tough, grasp it firmly and cut through the first layer of fat until all of it is severed. Preserve the eye from damage during this process. The cut should be either as described in the section on cutting fatty tissue or as a small incision.
If the tissue is completely cut through and all blood vessels are severed, protect the eye from any foreign matter by wiping it with a clean cloth or swab and applying pressure with a white bandage around the eye from outside the wound.
If some blood vessels remain and there is bleeding, dry the wound and treat the swelling. Then, do the work again until the swelling subsides and remove any excess tissue that is exposed in the eye of this type.
Be sure not to handle a weak eye with either pressure or work. Do not insert your hand into anything related to this work until you are sure that the patient is suitable for such work
The Eighth Chapter.
In the cutting of the vessels of the eye.
The blood vessels that are red in color are seen on the eye in order to prevent loss of sight from them and to weaken the eye over time. Therefore, you must be careful not to look at it if the eye in which the vessels are strong and there is no other disease except for the vessels.
The process of ligation is that you order the assistant to put his head in your chest, then grasp the vessels one at a time or two at a time according to your discretion and the vessels should be soft in this image:.
If two foreign bodies are juxtaposed in one body in this fashion:
Then it will be grasped with a fine pair of forceps, and blood will be evacuated from it until it is seen that the vessels have become freed from that foreign body, and the blood has returned to its place. This will protect the eye from the parts of the forceps which do not touch it, although the work will take half a day in the shade.
And it will be confirmed in your work just as if you did not cut except those vessels. For when you evacuate only that, green or red bile will remain in the eye which will eat away at the remainder of the thread which remains. If you are unable to grasp it all in that hour, leave what is remaining in the eye as it is, for it will cause no pain to the eye.
And leave it for some time until the pain subsides and the swelling is gone, then repeat the operation with the eye closed until the foreign body has been removed from that part of the body.
And leave it [as the pupil dilates and the eyelids droop, and secretes mucus, and confirms the spasm in front of the eye and behind it, and closes the eye with small incisions or like that which grasps the iris].
The pupil dilates and the eyelids droop, and secretes mucus. The spasm is confirmed in front of the eye and behind it. Choose whether to grasp the foreign body from above or from below. The first is if it is in the middle of the pupil, and the second is if it is at the edge of the pupil
And grasp it between the middle and the edge, then hook it with hooks from under the eyelashes, and grasp it between the pupil and the iris. Withdraw your hand slightly until you see the thread has gone from under the iris.
The surgeon should diligently apply pressure on the wound and bind all structures until the elevation reaches the level of the hump and breathing is not impaired.
Then cut off the clamp beyond the prominence from above and below until no pulsation remains in the hundredth part of an inch. If possible, raise it from the prominence cautiously with the hand of the surgeon. This is better and may sometimes heal in some people.</start_of_turn>
If you have cut it, let the surrounding area rest and be quiet and calm the inflammation. Then work on it again.</start_of_turn>
The Nineteenth Section.</start_of_turn>
In the armpit towards the nose.</start_of_turn>
It is called Napsara by the physicians. If you treat it with a leech or with strong medication applied to what is advanced of the description, and it does not heal, do not do anything except make an incision on the swelling when it becomes taut and evacuate all the pus or discharge from it.</start_of_turn
Until the bone is exposed. If you expose the bone and see pus or phlegm in it, cover it with this instrument.</start_of_turn
It is called the iron clamp. It is made of Indian steel and its head is rounded like the chisel. We make an incision with the scalpel or the hook of the clamp an incision resembling a peg on the bone, then place it on the site of the swelling and rotate it between the fingers until you know that the swelling has subsided.</start_of_turn
And do it several times. Then impose dry and astringent medications. If you stop the location and there is fat in it and cut blood vessels, and fourty days have passed and it has not subsided, and there is no swelling or discharge, there is no change.</start_of_turn
If the wound has healed, there is no remedy except to open the abscess again. This is done either by incision or by administering strong medication. If the bone is exposed, take forceps and grasp it in this manner.
The new part will be like a third, and will be secured firmly in place as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, which will be close to the eye and far from the hand. Then bring your hand over the hook until the bone breaks and becomes flexible.
When you feel the wind coming out, put your hand over your nose firmly so that the powder from the poultice will not rise. I have told you about these strong medicines that will dry out the abscess. If the flesh has been split open and the bone is exposed, the matter which was pressing inwards will return to the nose, making it easier for the patient
Chapter 10.
In response to eye ailments
If the eye is clear of any blemish and does not suffer from any defect, then make the pupil dilate by rubbing the ointment on the edge of the eye. Then remove the speck of dirt from the corner without causing any harm, and put a drop of salve in the corner without pressure.
Then put on the eye a compress made of vinegar, salt and oil, and urine. Keep it on for a long time, pressing the eye from above with a lot of pressure. The salve should be applied with a lot of gentleness so that no discharge comes out on four sides. Make many of these compresses
Then put one on top of the other on what the eye needs. Keep them on with a strong bandage. Put the salve on without pressure and remove the bandage after a day or two. Leave the eye closed for a day or two
If the ligament has relaxed within that period, then it should be tightened once more before removing the ligature. If the eye has recovered by that time, then the dressing, tension, tightening and probing should be repeated until recovery is complete.
The Twentieth Section.
In the limb segments.
If a hernia appears in the tendon layer and then becomes visible outside the vessels as a limb-like tendon and a bulge like a man, then I would cut it and do the work there as described previously
And that I insert a needle from under the tendon to the top, and then insert another needle into it with a silk thread like that from the flank and pass it through, and withdraw the first needle in its place
Then I cut the place of bending of the silk thread and tie it to some tendon around the needle and tighten it once more. I then remove the needle and put on the eye a piece of soft wool soaked in alum and leave it until the threads are absorbed with the tendon.
Until the wound heals, and the tendon has been tightened from all sides by the dressing until the eye recovers by itself, and becomes flexible once more, and is bound with soft cotton that reaches the root of the eye, so that the moisture of the eye is released and the eye descends and swells on the base. Then tighten it until recovery is complete
The Twenty-Second Section
In the treatment of burns.
This knowledge which is called burn, is when a collection of liquid like water descends on the eye without causing pain, and the method of action in this is that the physician should sit on a chair and take the head of the patient from both sides with his hands.
When the eye is downward-looking, it becomes fixed and does not move, and light shines forth from it and the objects appear as they did previously. If it does not descend to the lower part, we know that it is water. If its descent is not prepared as we have mentioned.
When the lower part of the eye is between the fingers, take a little powder and sprinkle it over the membrane covering the white of the eye, slightly pressing it into place until the mucus is expelled from the edge of the eye towards the pupil.
If only water comes out, it is hot water that has been mixed with ash or liquid that has boiled with ash and is treated with all the medications until it is healed
The Third and Thirtieth Chapters.
We have mentioned types of water in the division, and which one reaches the vessel in speech without explanation. Take it from there on the surface. When that happens, the lower part of the eye should be placed between the fingers and held against the light of the sun.
Connect the healthy eye and tighten it firmly, then lift the eyelid of the eye with your left hand if it is the left eye or with your right hand if it is the right eye
Then put the tip of the vessel close to the pupil with a slight bend in the front part of the eye, then push the vessel with force and hold it with your hand until it comes out into the white of the eye and you feel that it has reached something empty
And it should be known that the amount of the vessel’s descent is from the edge of the pupil to the bottom of the white of the eye, and that the pupil is seen in the same position as the reflection of the cornea. Then the vessel should rise above to the place where water is
If water descends gradually from its container, the cause of its movement is what opens its container from its side, and the [essence] is protruded in its eye. It settles slightly, and when water ascends again, it descends once more without the [essence] having exited.
If it settles and does not ascend again, the [essence] comes out along with the protruded part and you can feel its breaking by your hand a little at a time. Then it melts into the water with some salt that is like sand and washes the eye from inside out. Finally, put over the eye all the hair or cotton wool that you want.</start_of_turn>
It adheres to the pupil and the white of the eye and connects with the healthy eye. As for us and our time, we put over it a tightly closed bandage with white of egg, because sometimes the eye is too solid for the [essence] to enter due to some people.</start_of_turn> It is necessary to take a little of the substance that is called "the cold" which is in this image.</start_of_turn>
And pierce with it only the membrane without causing any damage, and indeed the essence will penetrate easily in a soft place. When you are finished, put in a little ointment and cover the eye with a clean bandage that is placed on the patient's face in a dark room.</start_of_turn
And avoid all movement and swallowing, and make his food what does not repel him naturally. Do not move his head from side to side or front to back. Keep his eye fixed on something still without blinking for three days, and then remove the bandage in that dark room and try his sight.</start_of_turn
Then give him things and rest the bandage until the seventh day. Do not do this at the time of treatment or after an hour of your time, but rather avoid it before the water ascends quickly and the sight is strained.</start_of_turn>
If the swelling is hot and wide, the eye must be treated before the seventh day. This can be done by administering what is contained in the swelling until it subsides. When it subsides, the eye should be wiped with a piece of cloth and a bandage should be placed over the eye which will protect the eye from any pressure. This should be done in a darkened room.
The swelling gradually subsides and becomes apparent in its margins. The surgeon should be aware that pride is not helpful in this matter. When he performs the operation, it has been reported by some of the Iraqis that he made an incision in the proud flesh and poured water into it.
None of us in our land have ever done that, nor have we read of it in any of the early books. It is possible that this is a new invention, and these are the types of bandages which are used for this purpose
A special kind of lead is used to make these bandages, and one end of it is like a needle with an eye at the end like a needle with an eye, and the other end is like a hook with a head like a nail
Twenty-four sections.
On the treatment of abscesses in the nose
Abscesses can occur in the nose due to various substances, some of which resemble spiders with many legs, and others which are cancerous tumors that secrete pus.
What is not harmful or cancerous, must be grasped between the fingers before sunrise, opened from below and the pus should be squeezed out of it, and then the edges should be cut off with a sharp knife from one side
Until you learn that all the flesh has gone, and if any remains, grasp it with any instrument and cut away everything until nothing remains. If blood or swelling remains, it is in vain
If there is any swelling or tumor that necessitates excision, perform the procedure until blood supply is severed and all tissue is excised. Then, insert the remainder into the nose, either through a natural opening or by creating an incision.
If it appears that the procedure has been successful, and the moisture has not escaped from the area that should retain it, know that the vital parts have been protected within the higher vertebrae, which have not been severed by the incision. Therefore, it is permissible to tie a thread of gutta-percha over the area for some protection
And make many knots there and put between each two knots the thickness of a thumb or less. Then, grasp the end of the thread with the little finger and pull it into the nose through the mouth or whatever opening is convenient, until it reaches the tonsils.
And comes out through the ring and is done like this by the unskilled people in the books. This is something easy for those who wish to do it. Then collect the two ends of the thread, one that comes out through the mouth and the other that remains in the nose
Then use the remaining fatty tissue around the thread to make knots. This is done until one learns that the tissue has been severed by the knots and the thread comes out and passes into the nose after wiping away the blood. This is done for three days or more.
Until all the remaining tissue has been consumed by the salve, and only the thread remains in the nose. The other substance in the nose becomes a tube of lead at any moment until it heals, and if there is still a need for treatment, this method is used
This image depicts the ligation of blood vessels in the nose using gutta-percha thread.
He places some cotton wool or beeswax resembling a small candle under the flap of skin and around the blood vessel.
If you desire, make the closed tube like the intestine and anoint the surface with oil.
If you wish, make the closed tube like the intestine and anoint the surface with oil. It has a grip at its end which grasps it if you put fat or any liquids or objects inside it.</start_of_turn>
The fifth and twentieth sections.
In the lower part of the nose on the side.</start_of_turn
It is often that in the side of the nose there are black spots which grow bigger and become visible until they disappear.</start_of_turn
And for that it is necessary to cut it out from its first appearance and take out all of it, and then bear upon the place either the cautery or the medicine which is like the cautery, for if you leave it there it will grow bigger and cause pain, and if it is solid like dark putty a little oil will suffice.</start_of_turn>
Do not expose it with iron, for it is a cancerous tumor and I have often seen that many of these tumors have been removed from their place with great ease, and if the tumor is soft and not like dark putty I have seen that the cutting can be performed in all of these cases.</start_of_turn Expel the urine and cut it out cautiously without haste and treat the place with what dries and contracts until it heals.</start_of_turn

In the sutures of the nose, cheek and ear.</start_of_turn If it has separated from the wound or something like that, know that it is late when it has separated in any of these places except for some people.</start_of_turn
When a portion of an organ has protruded due to a wound, if the wound is easily closed with blood clotting, the edges of the wound should be sutured together and the wound should be treated until it heals. However, if the wound has separated the edges and the connection between the tissues has been completely disrupted, each fragment should be left intact and the wound should be undermined until the fragments reunite.
The edges of the wound should be sutured together and the wound should be held in place with sutures. A paste of alum and powdered gypsum should be applied and a layer of lint or bandage should be placed over it. A layer of adhesive plaster or ointment should be applied on top and the wound should be left closed for two or three days before it is removed.</start_of_turn>
The dressing should be changed and the wound should be left open until the sutures have dissolved naturally. The wound should then be treated with ointment until it heals. The instructions for suturing the wound apply equally to its repair in the abdominal cavity or by other means as described previously.</start_of_turn>
Seventh and Twenty-eighth Chapter.</start_of_turn>
In the event of an extrusion of an organ that has protruded through the edges of a wound.</start_of_turn>
You may see many people with swellings within the edges of their wounds, resembling small abscesses or carbuncles of various sizes. In such a case, the edge of the wound should be turned back and the organ should be grasped and sutured to the underlying tissue.</start_of_turn
The edges should be cut from all sides. Then, powdered charcoal should be dusted over the area and the wound should be held closed with sutures until bleeding stops. The surrounding area should be treated with salt and ointment until the wounds have healed.</start_of_turn
Eighth and Twenty-ninth Chapter.</start_of_turn
In the excision of surplus flesh from the teeth.
In the excision of surplus flesh from the teeth, much is commonly found upon the teeth of excess flesh which is called the first [apical] of Apolloseus. It must be grasped with forceps or held with a hook and cut off at its base and a space is left open, or blood, and then a powdered bone is placed in the place.
Or if the molars are dry and one has previously treated the flesh and it recurs, much of it will not return after the treatment; if it recurs a second time and does not return after that, it is certain that it will not return ever.</start_of_turn>
The nineteenth section.</start_of_turn>
In the excision of the teeth with iron.</start_of_turn>
It may happen that in the teeth there is a collection of dentin from inside and outside and between the teeth there are rough scales which may become soft and fluid and reach as far as the teeth and cause them to loosen.
Therefore one must sit between the thumbs and index finger of both hands and grasp the tooth and the one which appears to you to have scales and sand and the like until nothing of it remains, and do the same with the swab and the poultice and other things like that until it is extracted.</start_of_turn>
If you have not extracted what is in front from the first incision and you do not extract it, it will return tomorrow and the day after and the day after that until you reach your goal in what you are doing. And know that the tooth requires different pangs and various forms according to the nature of your work.</start_of_turn
In order that the purge which is expelled from the tooth from inside should be different from the purge which is expelled from outside and the purge which is expelled between the teeth, there are various pangs which must be used for each of these conditions.</start_of_turn
Chapter Three.
In the extraction of teeth.
It is necessary to treat the tooth from every aspect and to be able to remove it without causing damage to the surrounding tissue. If it is not possible to remove the tooth without damaging the surrounding tissue, it is better to leave it in place rather than risk damaging the valuable nerve tissue surrounding it.
If one is forced to remove the tooth even though there is a risk of damaging the nerve, it must be done cautiously and skillfully until the tooth is completely free from the socket The patient often pretends that the pain is in the sound tooth when it is actually in the diseased tooth which is being extracted. We have seen this happen many times with cunning barbers.</start_of_turn>
If the patient claims that the pain is in the sound tooth, then one must tighten the bandage around the tooth with some force until the gum is loosened from all sides and can be easily moved with the fingers or forceps or slightly rotated until it is dislodged.</start_of_turn>
Then you can easily extract the tooth with the large forceps, which can grasp the root firmly without damaging the surrounding tissue. One should grasp the tooth from all sides and rotate it slightly so that it comes out easily without fracturing the tooth. If the tooth does not come out, do not use excessive force but rather insert one of the aforementioned instruments beneath the tooth from all sides and push and pull until it comes out.</start_of_turn
If the tooth is perforated or fractured, it is necessary to fill the hole with gutta percha and seal it tightly with a soft rubber stopper to prevent further bleeding. It is also important to ligate the surrounding tissue from all sides, even if it is not bleeding.</start_of_turn
Maintain your effort, for some of it will remain even after adversity has passed. Do not imitate the superficial practices of physicians, who perform their procedures without adequate knowledge.
Many do things to people without adequate knowledge, causing them great harm. Either the whole principle is broken or some of it remains intact. Or like what we have seen repeatedly - some break bones and then join them back together with a sponge or with nails and salt, and if there is a haemorrhage from the wound, they are amazed at the thing and blame the material.
And do not think that the application of plaster will suffice - if the bones were long to begin with, they will become even shorter when the plaster is applied, and if you grasp them too tightly, they will fracture again
Thus will be like what you see - too tight a grasp will break them even more than before, and if you grasp them too loosely, they will not be held together.
Indeed, you may make the limb flexible and strong at the same time.
The flexible and strong together.
In removing the roots of teeth and extracting fractured bones of the jaw.
If the root of the tooth remains after extraction, the fracture will persist for a day or two until the wound is healed, and then the sponge or plaster is placed Which resembles the plumage of the bird called the thrush, and this is the plaster method
If the incision has not been made from within or from beneath, and it is not necessary to exit through these openings, then one must dig up the root and expose all the tissue in the area, and then insert the instrument which resembles a small awl having this form.
If the incision has not been made from within or beneath, and it is not necessary to exit through these openings, then one must dig up the root and expose all the tissue in the area, and then insert the instrument which resembles a small awl having this shape. The first of these instruments is like a chisel with some substance in it.
Like a chisel with some substance in it.
We may also use this instrument which has two blades having this shape as well
And other instruments and hooks mentioned in the treatise of surgery, and we may also use this large awl having this shape
Like a chisel with some substance in it, little or much, for it is not painful, and I know that the instruments of surgery are many, and there are other instruments which have not been mentioned which are useful for various diseases and conditions.
For various diseases which have not been mentioned previously, there are instruments which are not like any of those mentioned, and which are useful for removing bone fragments from the jaw or any other bone in the mouth, or for opening wounds in their place with these instruments or other instruments mentioned previously in the opening of roots
And we use this image as an example.
There is some substance in it to stabilize the bone so that it does not slip out, and we apply the medication according to that. If there is a callous running in the bone, we remove it with the infection and then close the wound until it heals
The Third Chapter of the Tenth.
In the exposure of the protruded viscera from one another.
The viscera if protruded beyond their natural passage must be separated from each other. This is especially important if it occurs in women and children, for in such cases the viscera may have protruded from behind another viscus.
It is not possible to retract or elevate them without causing damage, and if they are adhered to another viscus it should be separated by means of this instrument which is commonly used for this purpose
It is like a small beak and its tip is like a sharp iron hook. It will sever the vessels and nerves that bind them to other viscera without damaging the surrounding organs. If the viscera are large and cannot be grasped directly, it should be grasped with forceps that are cold to the touch. This will cause them to retract without injuring anything else.
It is all from India and its tip is like a needle. It is cold to the touch like the needle which is used for stitching. It causes the viscera to retract slightly without causing them to tear. In many days it will sink into the viscera and become fixed there with some fat
If some of the viscus have fractured, it will cause the tongue to bleed when speaking. Therefore it should be removed along with the fracture and the surrounding area should be sutured so that it is smooth and does not cause bleeding or impair speech
The Third Chapter of the Tenth
In the stitching of the mobile viscera with threads of silver or gold.
If the viscera are old and tough they will tear and move away from the wound or fracture and will not be able to withstand any weight without falling off and causing further damage. Therefore it is not advisable to suture them without the use of strong medications that will prevent them from falling off during treatment
The ideal is to suture with silk or gold thread as the gold does not deteriorate over time while the silk is flexible and will not cause harm. The silk should be neither too loose nor too tight on the wound.
The image shows the process of stitching: take the thread and pass it through the hole between the two healthy teeth, then pass the needle through the tissue between the movable teeth until it reaches the healthy tooth on the opposite side.
Then you return the needle to the starting point and tighten the knot firmly so that the tissue is secure without causing damage. Cut off the excess thread and gather it together, then bury it under the healthy tooth and the movable tooth
Without causing damage to the tongue, and leave the remaining secure. If it dissolves or breaks, it can be secured with another thread. This image shows the teeth and the surgical process of stitching between two healthy teeth and two movable teeth as seen
The tooth or two that have fallen out may be repositioned in their place and sutured as described earlier. This is often done with the assistance of an assistant, who may use bone from a cow to create a new tooth socket. As described earlier, and it will remain comfortable.
Chapter 33.
In the sections that are shown under the tongue in the prevention of speech.
The suture of the tissue under the tongue may be either natural or traumatic, as in an injury that has healed over time
When performing the procedure, open the mouth of the patient and rotate the head towards the chest. Raise the tongue and cut the nerve connecting it to the tonsil until the tongue is freed from its obstruction. If there is some stiffness or resistance, and this is due to inflammation of the wound, cut through the swelling and split it open until the nerve is severed and the knot is released.
Beware that the incision must be deep into the tissue, and that a vein may be cut in the process. It should then be ligated using silk thread or a mixture of alum and cold water. Finally, keep the tongue covered with a bandage that binds the tonsil securely at night.
If there is no further bleeding, if, however, there is bleeding from the wound, sprinkle the area with powdered alum. If the bleeding persists, insert a swab soaked in adrenaline into the wound to control it Then leave the wound open until the bleeding has stopped
The fifth and thirty-third days.
When the swelling subsides under the tongue
There may be a swelling under the tongue resembling a small blister which hinders the natural movement of the tongue, and perhaps causes pain even when swallowing. The procedure involves opening the mouth wide in the sunlight and looking at the swelling.
If you see it pale or black and hard, do not be afraid of it. It is cancer. If there is pus in it, split it open with a fine needle from all sides
If there is bleeding during the procedure, sprinkle powdered alum over the area until the bleeding stops. Then continue the procedure until the wound is closed and finally suture it with salt and pepper
Treat according to every established method until the ailment is cured.
Sixth Chapter Thirty-three.
On the Treatment of Swelling of the Appendix
And nothing that appears in the throat of all swellings except that which is within the throat, and which appears outside are glands like those which appear outside is called an appendix. And if it is treated as mentioned in the previous division, it will not be cured
If the swelling is firm like a little black spot and little sensation, do not treat it with iron. But if it is red and thick, do not treat it with iron either for fear of bleeding, but leave it alone until it disappears naturally. Either drain it or let it burst by itself
If it is white and soft and its root is firm, this is what must be cut out. The act involves looking before acting if it has subsided and the swelling has become quiet or if some of the deficiency has disappeared
Then put the little one under the sun and raise its head in your chest and open your mouth and take a servant between your hands and stretch out your tongue downwards with this posture: .
You make from silver or from tin a piece that is thin like a knife. If you put it on the tongue and it shows you the swelling and you put your finger on it and grasp it outside what can be grasped without grasping anything of the bowels.
Then cut it with this instrument, which is like a pair of scissors, except that each one of its ends is hooked so that the tip of each one is parallel to the tip of the other. Make it from Indian steel or Damascus steel
If it does not harm this instrument and its fragments do not protrude beyond its outline, leave them as they are.
If it does not harm the instrument and its fragments do not protrude beyond its outline, leave them as they are.

If it does not harm the instrument and its fragments do not protrude beyond its outline, leave them as they are
If it does not harm the instrument and its fragments do not protrude beyond its outline, leave them as they are.
If it does not harm the instrument and its fragments do not protrude beyond its outline, leave them as they are.
If a hernia descends to the abdomen and becomes white and cylindrical, it is called an pillar. If it is thick at the bottom and rounded, it is called a hernia.
If the swelling has settled and is thin, it may be necessary to cut it. If there is no height to it and it is neither long nor short, and its color is pale or dark or black, or if it feels no pain, then it is best to avoid cutting it.
If a wound is suspected on the abdomen, if after examining it one finds it to be white and of equal length, then one should sit with the patient in the sun and bite one's tongue with the instrument that is being prescribed, then stitch the wound in the hernia
One should draw it downwards and cut it with either of the two instruments mentioned previously, and one should not cut it except as much as is necessary because cutting more will cause greater pain and speech impairment.
Then, after cutting, one should use what has been mentioned regarding cutting the hernia and treat it until it heals. If the abdomen is relaxed after cutting the hernia, then one should use the technique of tying it up without fear or caution and directing the face towards the head, for that is by the strong medicine, which is placing the head in the abdomen
Then one bites the tongue with the instrument that was mentioned previously and takes strong medicine which was mentioned in the chapter, and makes it neither thick nor thin, and fills it with the contents of the wound.
The part of the instrument which is placed with the medicine has a wound similar to a wound in a purse, and the instrument is placed over the hernia itself and the abdomen is pressed against it so that no saliva can escape from it from inside the loop, for otherwise it will descend into the loop and cause him pain
Hold the hand of the patient firmly with the drug and keep it on the Lord for half an hour until you see that the discoloration has vanished and the wound has healed. If you wish, take a small piece of cotton and wrap it around the tip of your finger and press it into the drug.
Hold the hand of the patient firmly with the drug and keep it on the Lord for half an hour until you see that the discoloration has vanished and the wound has healed. If you wish, take a small piece of cotton and wrap it around the tip of your finger and press it into the drug. Insert the swab into the tube from above until the swab is firmly fixed to the Lord. Repeat this until you reach the desired length. Then remove the swab when it has softened and fallen out after three or four days. If necessary, repeat the drug
After the length has been achieved, wrap the swab around the circumference of the wound with a moist compress and leave it on. Then drain around the wound with cool water and treat from outside with compresses and from inside with poultices until healed. This method is safe and eliminates fear of amputation.
The Lord can also treat some of the wounds by pouring perfume on this manner. Take alum, saffron, alum stone, water hemlock, chamomile and vinegar and mix them together or some of them in a vessel and pour them onto the wound
The vessel should be covered with a layer of wisdom and be placed in the middle of the cover with a perforated utensil made of silver or gold on this manner
Insert the tip of the swab into the nostril until the vapor reaches the Lord on the tube until it is sufficiently softened. Repeat this process until the Lord has recovered. Even if you perform this treatment from the beginning of the swelling
It is often necessary to increase the swelling when the swelling has subsided and the tumor has become soft. If you do not have this instrument, take a piece of quince and press it onto the tip of your finger and bind it to the side of the wound so as not to burn the nostril.
Since the membrane of the belly [intestine] is tough, it hinders the burning of the vapor [of the medicine] that would otherwise burn the mouth, which is beneficial for treatment with safety.
The Tenth Section and the Thirtieth Section.
As for the protrusion of the bone and what emerges from the throat except for that...
There is often protrusion of the bone or a thick thorn or something of that kind in the throat which escapes the eye after the tongue is grasped by the instrument at the time of exposure to the sun.
This will enable you to see what is in the throat which escapes your sight and is hidden in the throat, so that you may vomit before swallowing food, lest what escapes should come out with the vomit or be swallowed in pieces or entirely lost
or swallow a piece of bread which has become stuck or take a piece of marine sponge which you tie in a knot and then swallow it. If it reaches the position of the thorn, grasp the knot quickly and do this several times.</start_of_turn>
For indeed much of what protrudes from the bone or the thorn remains within it and escapes, except for what we have mentioned. If it does not escape with what we have mentioned, use an instrument resembling a needle for this purpose.</start_of_turn>
It is thick, little, and at its tip it grasps the tongue and raises it towards the head and protects the epiglottis from the bone or thorn, or the physician inserts it with his hand.</start_of_turn
The insertion of the tongue has a better effect on the treatment of the escaping substance and drives it downwards or grasps it with the instrument above all that, when done correctly, until it escapes.</start_of_turn>

If the lesion does not respond to the treatment and medications mentioned earlier, and if it persists in the throat after the tongue has been sutured with the instrument described previously.
...then a small incision is made over the lesion, or a tight ligature is placed around it. If this is not sufficient, a tube is introduced through the throat to the vicinity of the lesion, and a tube is placed inside another tube which is protected from the flame.
This is done repeatedly. The throat should be kept dry for a whole day. Then, a cold compress is taken and applied to the mouth, and the wound is closed with sutures. He should not drink anything, but drink plenty of water after some time with his hand holding the water
...If the tonsil finally descends after these measures have been taken, and if he feels water, do not drink water, but apply pressure to the throat with the thumb and index finger of the hand that has the instrument. This is done repeatedly until the tonsil descends
...Take care of the smoke so that it does not take too much of the powdered charcoal and the fuel. Put a little covering over the middle of the opening and put the instrument in that opening and throw the smoke and put the throat in the tube and close the mouth so that the smoke does not escape until you are certain that the smoke has reached the throat
...If the tonsil descends finally, and if it does not descend, repeat the smoking process several times. The patient should be patient and inhale deeply and exhale slowly without drinking water. He should not be forced to vomit, for this is an indication of excessive smoke. This is an instrument which grasps the tonsil from the throat if it comes into contact with it
The wounds resemble boils, except that they have this peculiar marking that enters the throat and their extremities resemble the beak of a bird in its dryness.
There are other instruments that grasp the tongue. They are wide rings of iron as large as the mouth can contain, which enter the mouth alongside the tongue and rest on its side, leaving the mouth open without the patient's will, and the tongue cannot be retracted until it is expelled from the wound
The instrument that opens the mouth to this extent is like that.
The limb fractures
There is speech in tumors and their cutting
Tumors are various and differ in their nature and cutting from one another depending on their type and the presence of moisture in them
The second type is that which speaks from the body because the head tumor is not like the abdominal or pelvic tumor, and the head tumor in the hamstring is not like the tumor in the elbow or knee joint, each of which is judged by its work.
Some tumors should not be treated until the pus has matured in them, and some should not be treated at all, for they are not fully matured like those that are close to joints
Because if the tumor happens close to a joint and persists, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, which will cause lameness of that limb or the organ
Because if you remove it until it matures, you may damage the main limb or organ nearby, or if it is close to the buttocks, leaving it untreated may cause it to burst inside the buttocks and become pus-filled
The disease persists until it ceases to cause pain. One must learn the times when the swelling has subsided and the fever has vanished, the redness has diminished, and the pain has ceased.
One must expect the swelling to descend to a lower part of the swelling if possible, as this will make drainage easier. But if it descends throughout the body, if the swelling is in the hands or feet, it must be drained from a higher level.</start_of_turn>
The muscles, nerves, veins and arteries, and all parts of every level that does not flex, must be drained by the incision. As for those that flex, drain them according to their situation. And if the swelling is in a high place, it is better to leave the incision in that place.</start_of_turn>
Until the swelling subsides as we have mentioned, if you drain it before that, much pus will issue from it and be much thicker and perhaps split the edges. Some swellings may be drained across the body when necessary, or according to the need of the limb.</start_of_turn>
One must use a fine needle for small swellings and a large needle or multiple incisions for large swellings. Some swellings may require the excision of the skin and cutting if it has become like a membrane.</start_of_turn>
It is like what is seen in many diseases and plagues, and among them what has three angles and what cuts like a sheet of corrugated iron.</start_of_turn>
Among them are the spiral incision, the crescent incision and the like of them. As for those that do not have a head like flat tumours, it is enough to make a small incision only. But if the swelling is large and has gathered for a long time, and you drain it all at once, the pus will come out together at that time.</start_of_turn
Some of the pus is expelled, then the swelling is tightened until the next day, and some of the pus is also expelled repeatedly in stages until all of it is expelled.
There is no particular reason if the patient is weak or powerful, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man. The vital spirit is often what hinders the discharge of pus with its expulsion.
After the removal of these abscesses, the wound should be washed and inspected. If the abscess is small or the incision is simple, use a piece of cotton or linen and if the abscess is large and there are many incisions, use silk thread
The incision should be made in each opening so that some of them reach others. If the abscess has been cut through the skin or has become soft, it should be covered with cotton wool or linen and bound on the third day.
Then it should be drained and dressed with whatever is necessary until it heals. If there is bleeding during the process, use cold water and vinegar after swallowing them to soak up the blood and carry it away.
If bleeding persists, various treatments and medications are mentioned in many places of this book and in other medical texts. If it is winter and the abscess is in a sensitive area, it is recommended to apply wet compresses and mustard plaster
Apply it to the place. If it is summer and the area is sensitive, it is recommended to pack wet compresses with mustard plaster or with water and oil or with wet compresses only until the third day as mentioned previously, and the abscess will be healed and the wound will be washed
The treatment is used for whatever does not resemble it until it is healed. As for the method of treatment, it has been mentioned for each tumor how to treat it briefly and concisely.
The section heading reads: "The Hundred and Forty Sections.
Regarding the tumors that appear on the head and neck...
...There are small tumors that appear on the head and neck, such as those that resemble swelling of a chicken or tumors that contain fluid resembling blood.
Some of them contain fluid resembling pus or blood, while others are solid and do not pose a risk. Their excision does not obstruct any vessels when they are removed
The method of excision is as follows: we first numb the area with an instrument, then we make a small incision on the surface of the tumor until we learn what it contains. If it contains fluid, we make a larger incision to remove it completely.
We begin by incuding from line ~b~ to line ~g~. If the fluid is drained, remove the sac that contained it completely and do not leave anything behind. Many times, if anything remains, it will come back again
Then we apply a compress to the wound with either oil or salt water and leave it open until tomorrow. If there is still swelling, we repeat the procedure of applying a compress with oil or salt water a second and third time if necessary
Until the tumor is completely gone, we continue to treat the wound with medications until it heals, even if it contains fat tumors. In this case, we remove the tumor in this manner
If the intestines are tied up in the wound and prevent evacuation of the abdominal cavity, cut them from all sides and use all your effort to remove the intestines that are contained within. If any arteries are encountered during the process, cut them off without hesitation. If there is any suspicion of an abscess, cut it open if necessary.
The treatment is as described above. Incision of the abscess is easier because it has little blood and purulence. Some of these abscesses in the head may have no pus because of the lack of blood supply to them.
The abscess of a woman of advanced age is like a stone abscess. It cannot be broken by hand or by anyone who attempts to break it. The other abscesses that are common in the heads of children are different from this
When the intestines are tied up in the wound and prevent evacuation of the abdominal cavity, make an incision through all of them and use all your effort to remove the intestines contained within. Treat any arteries encountered during the process without delay and treat the abscess if necessary by making an incision
Second and fourth parts.
The abscesses that are commonly seen in the nape of the neck often appear in the neck and armpits and sometimes in other parts of the body. Some of these abscesses are caused by some of the others
Every abscess of this kind has its own special abdominal cavity. There are abscesses in the neck, armpits and head, as we described previously. There are different types of these abscesses. Some are purulent and some are bloody, and some do not respond to treatment
I have not seen anything like it in terms of its outward appearance, close to the color of the skin, moving in all directions without being bound by the neck vein, jugular vein or artery, and not being filled with pus The incision should be made in a straight line from the upper to the lower part of the body, following the line from ~j~ to ~b~:.
The incision should be made from all sides and the edges of the skin should be stretched with a slip or two or more pins as needed, as is often done in head wounds and the exit should be gradual and not too deep, and should be on the neck, not cutting the vein or artery, but rather slightly beyond the bone.
Otherwise, do not make the incision too deep or too shallow, for excessive bleeding will make the work difficult. If the vein or artery is cut, tie it off with powdered charcoal or some sponges which will stop the bleeding.
Close the wound and leave it until the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes. Then check for bleeding, which may recur, and if there is still bleeding, use your thumb to press on the wound until the bleeding stops. Then open the wound again with smaller incisions and remove any remaining blood clots.
If there is much blood in the wound from the beginning, do not cut through the original wound but should tie it off with a suture and leave it until it falls off naturally without causing further harm. Then cover the wound with cotton wool and apply Egyptian plaster and treat it.</start_of_turn>
If the entire wound has been cut, gather the edges of the wound and suture it from its suture time after learning that the bone is not displaced. If you see that some bone remains, leave it in place.</start_of_turn>
The incision should be made from the root and the bone should be repositioned and sutured as described previously. The pins which were placed to hold the wound open should be removed when you can see the area of healing and make the area below as described earlier.</start_of_turn>
If the wound has become infected with pus, use an absorbent dressing and cover it until the wound has healed and eaten up the remaining pus.
Third and fortieth section.
In the epiglottis there is a swelling that has occurred within the throat
It has been mentioned previously in the epiglottis that I have not seen anyone in my country who has suffered from this, and as for those who have laryngitis, they should not neglect the epiglottis because it will not benefit them in any way
In order that all the limbs and the chest may be relaxed, and as for those who have a swelling in the mouth or throat or tonsils and there is no cause in the chest, it is necessary to use the epiglottis to escape from the poison
It is necessary if we are going to do this that we cut the epiglottis under three rings of the chest or four small incisions in width between two rings as much as the incision is in fat and not in bone, and this position is consonant with the epiglottis
Since it is devoid of fat and blood vessels, if the surgeon is cautious, he should cool the throat with snow and then make an incision until he reaches the chest alongside the blood vessels if he sees anything of them.
Then he makes an incision in the fat which we described, and he takes hold of the epiglottis from the mucus which comes out of it with the barking and hoarseness and leaves the wound open for a while. If the time which was expected to pass has elapsed without any relief from the choking, he should gather the edges of the wound from the skin
And he did one step only from the bone then he uses the medicines which promote the growth of tissue until it heals, as this book explains, this is the interpretation of this sentence which we mentioned if you see little of it has closed one of these swellings
The ruler has ascended death and those who are with him have cut their tongues to the epiglottis so that the ruler may have some air and escape death, while they leave the wound open until the plague has passed and their verse is three days.

The ruler has ascended death and those who are with him have cut their tongues to the epiglottis so that the ruler may have some air and escape death, while they leave the wound open until the plague has passed and their verse is three days The incision should not be made too large, except for very small wounds. If the incision is made too wide, it will resemble a wound caused by a blunt instrument and will not be related to any of the arteries. It should be excised with its sac if it is in a sac, otherwise remove all of it. Then treat the remaining area as required.</start_of_turn>
The incision is made at the fifth and fourth intercostal spaces.</start_of_turn>
On the ribcage of different types of wounds.</start_of_turn>
There are many types of wounds. We have mentioned most of them in the division. It should be known that the abscess is accompanied by heat, swelling, and pain until it subsides. The swelling subsides when the heat and pain cease. The abscess does not accompany heat, swelling, or pain and contains a fluid-filled sac that has its own container and is pale in color, resembling porridge, and becomes large and small.</start_of_turn>
It exists in two forms: either fat or moist. The color of moisture is many as we mentioned in the division. If the abscess is suspected, it should be incised first with the instrument called the forceps as described previously.</start_of_turn
The size of the abscess can be known. Then, the forceps are used to open it and observe what comes out. If fluid comes out, regardless of its color, the wound is incised with a simple incision as described previously. If no fluid comes out despite using the forceps, it is known that the abscess is fat.</start_of_turn>
Close the incision carefully with sutures as needed, and remove the skin from all sides while preserving it within the pouch if possible.
If the pouch bursts during the procedure and the contents cannot be safely extracted, leave only enough skin attached to prevent excessive loss, and perform closure in stages until no skin remains attached to the surrounding tissue.
If some skin remains attached despite the bursting of the pouch, leave only a small area of attached skin to prevent excessive bleeding, and gradually close the wound with sutures until no skin is left attached to the surrounding tissue. If there is significant bleeding, close the wound cautiously and treat the underlying cause of the bleeding
If there is excessive bleeding or a blood clot is visible, immediately apply a powdered sponge or bandage and maintain pressure for two or three days until the wound heals and bleeding subsides. Then, proceed with the closure of the remaining skin.
Sixth and forty-fourth section.

When dealing with incisions and wounds, there are three types of sutures commonly used: large, medium, and small
Large suture image caption
Medium suture image caption
Small suture image caption
Suture material is made of iron or steel, and is available in three sizes: large, medium, and small. The image shows the different types of sutures, which are called "bandages.
Medium suture image caption
Small Incision
Small Incision
Surgical instruments can also be made from black lead. These are effective in softening tough tissues. There are three types of these instruments: long, intermediate, and short.
As for the parts that require softening, their toughness will be overcome by the large lead weight placed on them
(Image caption: A surgical instrument made from black lead
(Image caption: A surgical instrument made from small lead
There are many types of needles because some have a single hook and are classified into three types: large, intermediate, and small. Some needles have multiple hooks and are classified into three types, and some needles are curved and are classified into three types. And there are needles with three barbs and are of three types. All of these types are suitable for their respective purposes, as for simple sutures of great size (Image caption: Simple suture (Image caption: Simple suture of small size

(Image caption: Intermediate needle with three barbs Surgeries of small size involving three categories.
These surgeries of small size encompass three categories: large, medium, and small in size.
Medium-sized surgery
Small-sized surgery
The incisions in small surgeries are limited, while the extremities are not limited. This makes it easier to remove the foreign body in the event of a nerve or vein cut, and provides greater comfort with little pain.
These surgeries are deceptive in that they encompass three categories: large, medium, and small in size.
It is made from a piece of semi-flexible material like a twisted reed, with one end resembling a wide split lip that hangs downwards like a bird's beak. It extends inwards and outwards as desired
The painless procedures that are placed between the fingers when tumors exist are of three types: large, medium, and small in size
The procedures that cut bleeding are of three types: large, medium, and small in size.
It is made from gut or silk thread, somewhat short as you see, and should be of large or small size to stop bleeding quickly in an emergency when medication is unavailable
Blood is not to be used in every part of the body, but rather in areas that are humi, such as the bone of the limb, the knee, the arm, the shoulder, the abdomen and the testicles.
Blood should not be used in every part of the body, but rather in areas which are humi, such as the bones of the limb, the knee, the arm, the shoulder, the abdomen and the testicles.
Blood is to be cut if it bleeds from a wound or when cutting a vein or artery, and may be formed into an instrument resembling small scales of pistachio in this fashion
The Seventh Forty-Second Section.
In the area of the shoulder joint
Which resembles the shoulder joint of women, sometimes swells in some people to the extent that it becomes like the shoulder joint of women, and it becomes unsightly. Whoever dislikes this should dissect the shoulder with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner
From line ~b~ to line ~g~ Then remove all the fat and fill the wound with absorbent material, then close the wound with sutures and treat until it heals, and if the shoulder does not descend and relax its bone as women do.
It is necessary to make two incisions on the upper sides which resemble crescent shapes, each connecting to the other at its end so that the larger circle encompasses the smaller circle in this fashion From line ~b~ to line ~g~, then separate the skin between the incisions and remove the fat, and use what we mentioned of sutures and dressings as needed until it heals
If it does not swell after cutting what is necessary to tighten the limb or before bleeding stops, then it is necessary to fill the wound with cotton soaked in ointment and leave it until it has eaten up the remaining fat, and then treat it until it heals
The Eighth Forty Section.
On the parts of the body which are exposed under the armpit.
These parts of the body which are exposed under the armpit are of the kind of solid humps which contain sacs and which also contain liquids. As for what is contained in them, some of it contains liquids and some of it does not. Therefore, it is necessary to make a circular incision on this form
From line ~b~ to line ~j~. And if you evacuate all that is in the abscess from the opening, cover it with cotton wool and leave it for another day, then remove the cotton wool
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the abscess is of the kind of solid humps, make an incision on it as we mentioned concerning humps, whether you perform the incision immediately or later when the wound has subsided. And use the knife as we mentioned previously in what follows.
The Ninth Forty Section
On the incision of the abscess which reveals a vein or an artery and is called an aneurism.
If you cut the vein and the surrounding skin above it, there is often a lot of what is revealed from that and swelling also reveals itself in the vein that there is swelling and inflation
And the signs which show that the abscess is from a vein or an artery are that the swelling is continuous throughout the body and if you press your finger into the abscess you will feel pressure as if there is air in it
And if it is from the vein, the abscess is superficial on the surface of the body and the incision for these abscesses is dangerous, especially if it is in the armpit, the groin or the neck and in many parts of the body where it is great. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid their treatment by incisions
If there is swelling in the limbs or the head, it is necessary to avoid any dissection there. As for any swelling that is caused by a bursting vessel, pierce it through the skin with a needle of suitable length, then open the opening with sutures and extract the vessel from the surrounding fat.

Chapter Fifty.
In the swelling which reveals nerve torsion.
The swelling also reveals itself in the artery and vein, as well as in the nerve itself, if there has been a blow or if there is excessive tension or prolapse in any of these. This is more common in the joints and the heels
In every place where there is movement of the joints, and in every swelling which is fluid-filled and resembles the color of the rest of the body, and which is more common in most conditions than not, and if pressure is applied with force, there is a sensation similar to pain, but the swelling is not deep-seated in the body
It remains superficial and moves in all directions, not going forward or backward, and what is in the joints does not need to be exposed with the needle as it may cause damage and may take time. What is in the head or the brow is not like that
The skin should be split open with a knife, and if the swelling is small, grasp it with forceps and excise it from its root. If it is large, do it with a burn and then remove it and gather the wound with sutures and stitch it up until it is healed.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On the parts of the thigh which are exposed in the abdomen.
It is often seen in some people in their abdomen and in all parts of their body, a swelling called the fat-ring which resembles the fat of its origin, is soft at the root and hard at the head, has become split and is small, and from it there comes what is not great or little.
And sometimes men have seen in their abdomen two swellings which resembled two grapes, which were like the fat of their origin, soft at the root and hard at the head, had become split and burst, and moisture poured out of them always, except that we put our hands on them and threw them away with one eighth or two-tenths of a pound, or sometimes with six-tenths of a pound
When dealing with an infected wound, if the cause is wet, and the color of the boils is white and thick in origin, then only a broad needle should be used to drain it. Keep the wound elevated above the level of the heart so as to reduce the amount of blood that flows out.
When blood flows excessively and the wound is closed, if you observe that the boils are closed and hardened by the hook, take a strong suture and tighten it securely around the boils. Leave it in place for two days, then remove the suture gradually until the wound is completely healed
When the boils become soft and loosen from each other without any violent action, if the boils are of thick origin, there is some fear and danger in cutting them, especially if they are in the abdomen. However, it may be necessary to cut through half or some of them.
Then let it be closed so that it does not open again, and treat the wound until it heals completely. Take caution that when cutting boils there is little sensation and much pain, for it is a cancerous tumor and we shall speak of cancer later on in this book.
Chapter 25.
In the treatment of tumors.
Tumors have many causes, either due to the bursting of the abdomen and the discharge of its contents, or the presence of tumors in other parts of the body, or the emission of blood from veins or arteries, or from gases under pressure
If previously the abdomen had burst and its contents were discharged, the tumor will be white like the body and will appear greasy without causing much pain. Different postures will be seen If previously the intestines had protruded, it will be more painful. If you grasp it with your fingers and it relaxes, and there is perhaps vomiting and great pain when exposed to heat or water, this is an indication of an abscess.
If a swelling appears in your hand, neither increasing nor decreasing in size, and if it is due to blood, it will show black spots; if it is due to fatty tissue, it will be firm and solid and will rest on one portion.
If it is caused by air, it is easy to detect; when there is swelling due to a blood vessel or a vein or air, it is necessary to seek treatment, for there is fear and swelling as I have mentioned previously regarding swellings caused by blood vessels and veins.</start_of_turn>
If it is caused by swelling of the intestines or fat, it is necessary to order the patient to lie still and rest, and then learn by palpation around the swelling of all its parts.</start_of_turn> Then order him to lie between your hands on his back, and grasp around the swelling with a broad bandage at the place where you learned by palpation, and extend the swelling upwards to above the navel, and then tie the place of the bandage with a strong thread or silk cord securely.</start_of_turn>
The cord should be tight, then open the swelling and insert your index finger into the opening and ask the patient if he feels it has taken hold. If so, loosen the tightening and bring the swelling inwards towards the abdomen. If there is fat, push it down into the navel.</start_of_turn>
Close the opening, but if any blood vessel or vein is obstructing, remove it. Repeat the work and take two needles and pass two strong threads through them, and pass the needles through the swelling in four places that you have made around the swelling, and then tighten the swelling securely.</start_of_turn
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the fatty tissue hanging. It will naturally slip away or cut it off if necessary. Then treat the wound with what is necessary until it heals, if there is fatty tissue in the swelling.</start_of_turn
If the swelling persists despite application of pressure, it should be drained of blood or fluid. Then the underlying tissue should be treated with an absorbent substance.
The third part and the fifth part.
In the treatment of tumors.
We have mentioned previously the different types of tumors and how to treat them with medication and precautions against their treatment with iron, as it may worsen the condition. We have also mentioned tumors that arise in the uterus and precautions against their treatment
The first part stated that when a tumor is located in a place where it can be completely excised, such as that which is in the chest or thigh, and the like, it should be removed entirely. This is especially true if the tumor is small and has not spread. But if the tumor is large, it is not advisable to attempt to remove it completely
And if I am unable to cure it for anyone and have not seen previously anyone who has reached that stage, and the work is laborious as we mentioned, it should be gradually increased until the black bile is discharged. Then it should be drained if it is in the veins or filled between the layers
Then an incision is made with a strong instrument, and the tumor is evacuated with the aid of forceps. The surrounding tissue is then cauterized with a needle until the bleeding stops. The blood is allowed to flow freely without being obstructed
The thick blood clots should be removed with the hand or with instruments, and if there is bleeding from a vein or artery, it should be ligated until the bleeding stops. Then the wound should be closed with all the treatment until the wound is healed
The fourth part and the fifth part
In the Treatment of Wounds.
We have previously discussed the classification of wounds and how water interacts with each type, along with their signs and treatment medications. This applies specifically to the scalpel wound, which should not be treated with the same methods as the traumatic or incisional wound
If this is the case, and you have treated this type of wound with medications and it has not healed, then perhaps the cause is weakness or another underlying disease other than the wound itself, such as an infection
So do not hesitate to treat it with the clamp if you think that is appropriate. If you see weakness and do not see any other disease besides the wound itself, then confine your work to the wound and abstain from other procedures. And behind him one grasps his abdomen with both hands and passes water downwards to the navel area and then takes a small incision over this area
Limited in extent, long, restricted to the tip like a clamp, except that there is a little pus there which does not exceed the work when performing the procedure on the intestine, as it evacuates if the wound originates from the intestines
The distance of the incision from the navel should be three fingers downwards. If the wound originates from liver disease, the incision should be three fingers below the navel. If the wound originates from spleen disease, the incision should be on the right side three fingers below the navel
It is also not permissible for the incision to be in the area where the surgeon wants to place his hand to prevent fluid from collecting in that weak area. Then grasp the skin around the incision with forceps and enter the instrument through the incision and raise your hand.
If you insert the trocar between skin and tissue as if you are sewing them together, the quantity of tissue you can grasp is equal to the amount of air or whatever is in it. Then grasp the peritoneum until the trocar reaches an empty place, which is the place of water, and then withdraw it and insert the instrument which has this shape.
It is like a tube made of soft metal, fabricated from silver or tin or gutta percha with a small hole at the bottom and three holes on the sides, two from one side and one from the other as you see
The tip of it can be made blunt like the pen on this form.
At the top of it there is a ring. If the instrument reaches the water it will slip from its handle. It will drain from the water gradually, for if you drain it too quickly the spirit of the animal will be lost.
Or shows him a covering close to death, but drains from him in proportion to its power and what it implies for the condition of the animal, then the instrument is withdrawn and the water is held by it, for it has grasped from its handle
Because of the skin which grasps the hole on the peritoneum which you were told to grasp on that form, then the instrument is returned another day if you see the animal covered with that.
It also comes out of the water easily. This happens every time and you are cautious and protect from mistakes until there is left of the water except a little which is effective in the burial of the dead in the sand
There is much sweating in the bath and the sun and pouring on the body and the ointment and the dried herbs until it becomes cool. It is applied to the stomach and the liver and the spleen after the water has been withdrawn as described previously.

Some infants may be born from their mother's womb without being completely developed, and in this case, their vital organs may be immature.
Their vital organs may be immature.
Their vital organs need to be supported for three or four days until the bowel function returns. Otherwise, if the intestines are not secured, the urine or feces may leak out and the baby may suffer complications from this.</start_of_turn>
The immature organs need to be supported for some time until they mature. If the intestines are not properly secured, there is a risk of leakage of urine or feces, which can cause complications for the baby.</start_of_turn>
Until the bladder is mature enough to hold urine, the infant is unable to urinate due to its immature state. This is a serious condition that requires careful management. The baby should be placed on his back.</start_of_turn>
Then, with your left hand, gently lift the mother's uterus and stabilize the bladder with your thumb or by grasping the cord just above the navel. This will prevent the uterus from prolapse and ensure that the intestines are properly positioned.</start_of_turn
Always take precautions to prevent bleeding during the process and promptly address any bleeding by cauterizing the vessel and treating the wound until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Sixth and Seventh Chapters.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the swelling in the groin, uterus, abdomen, boils, carbuncles, and the adhesion of the abdomen to the uterus.</start_of_turn
This swelling is commonly seen in the urinary tract and is caused by a severe infection, usually streptococcal. Some of these abscesses are harmless, while others are serious and require drainage.
If the wound is dirty, remove all of the dirt and debris. Then apply a wet compress to the wound. Finally, treat the wound with honey until it heals. If the wound is infected, remove any pus after cleaning and then apply pressure to the wound with a bandage.
If the wound is dirty but has not burst, and some of the wound is inside the cavity and some is outside, it is necessary to drain the wound from inside outwards first, even if it causes damage, before treating it from outside
When treating the wound both inside and outside is not safe, as it may cause the cavity to rupture. There may also be swelling and decay inside the cavity and outside, so it is necessary to drain all of the pus and ensure that there is no further infection or decay.
Then apply honey with mustard seeds and cloves, and cover with a bandage. Treat the wound until it heals. If there is bleeding, use sponges soaked in wine on this occasion
If sponges soaked in wine are used for bleeding and the wound has burst, it is necessary to insert the sponge into the wound in order to stop the bleeding.
This is because the wound is healthy and has not been injured, and may be due to infection or swelling. It is necessary to remove the dressing and inspect the wound before attempting to close it again
If the dressing is not removed, it may be due to the thinness of the skin and its rapid rupture. Separate the wound from the dressing with a fine gauze soaked in cold water to prevent adhesion.
If there is an abscess containing pus, it should be treated until it resolves.
Seventh chapter: Treatment of abscesses.
In the cleansing of wounds and treatment of what troubles them.</start_of_turn>
The incision is not something except for separation of vessels as all surgeons know, except that it is not from our work to do it intentionally and to use it in wounds specifically. We must take precautions and be careful in this work.</start_of_turn>
The easiest way to achieve safety is to say that the first authors did not mention incision in any of their books because they did not use it in their surgeries. We have learned it.</start_of_turn>
So we have seen that some of the surgeons and physicians use cleansing with sponges and needles, and they use sutures and ligatures with threads and clips, and all of these things have resulted.</start_of_turn
I do not find better than the cleansing with needles and ligation with threads because the cleansing with sponges often does not remove the purulent discharge because the purulent layer is thick and two layers of covering adhere to each other, so the upper layer breaks and the lower layer remains.</start_of_turn
So we are forced to cut again and stop the bleeding and perform the cleansing with the needle. The cleansing with thread is not safe because it may enter the lumen. As for the cleansing with a needle, it is not safe because it may tear the blood vessels or make the wound worse, or the patient's skin is thin by nature.</start_of_turn
There are many other things that cause wounds not to heal, and they do not require cleansing. I have seen that many times. And as for the cleansing with needle and ligation, experience has shown that it is better than the other methods because the needle is sharp and the clip is appropriate for the size of the wound.</start_of_turn
When you have passed your hand over the area of the wound that corresponds to the two edges, having cut them to be equal in size and time, the thread becomes like a wall surrounding the edges of the wound, preventing any displacement of the tissues from any direction. The first action is to make the patient understand.
There is no need to particularly explain to a patient who is illiterate that the thread is only being used to hold the tissues together for now and will be removed later.
It is not necessary for the patient to be aware of the needle or any instrument that is passing through the wound, as this might cause fear or pain. Insert your hand into the wound and grasp the tissues, tightening them until the wound edges are taut.
Then remove whatever is contained within the wound. Secure the tissues with a fine suture and another suture below it. Pinch the base of the suture with your thumb and index finger and cut between the sutures. Then elevate the wound quickly and remove the needle. Leave a small amount of blood to flow. This is better and causes less swelling. Cover the wound with a wet compress and leave it for a while.
Then elevate the wound quickly and remove the needle. Leave a small amount of blood to flow. This is better and causes less swelling. Cover the wound with a wet compress and leave it for a while. Finally, keep the wound covered with wet sponges and leave it for a while. Then treat the wound with all the usual medications until it heals completely.
This image depicts the instrument used for cleaning the wound.
The needle should be grasped without tension and the wound edges should be equal in length. If the wound edges are not adequately tensioned during cleaning, the tissues within the wound might tear when the suture is cut
If it is impossible to grasp the swelling with your finger, grasp it with forceps and clamp it. If the swelling persists for three days and the underlying tissue remains swollen and painful, leave the clamp in place until the swelling subsides and the pain is relieved.
The swelling should be removed as required for your situation, preserving the head of the vein. If anything is cut from the head of the vein, it does not harm, for this is what alleviates the pain from the wound that we mentioned in the section on wounds.</start_of_turn>
If the cutting of fat above measure and reduction to above does not harm, it is also very useful. This is because of what we mentioned until it heals.</start_of_turn>
The Eighth Section and the Fifth Section.</start_of_turn>
In the treatment of urinary retention in the bladder.</start_of_turn>
Urinary retention in the bladder is caused by obstruction from stones, blood clots, pus, fat or other similar substances. If these are treated according to what is mentioned in the division, the aforementioned treatment groups are used.</start_of_turn
And if the urine has not passed and you see that its retention is from a stone in the neck of the bladder, it is necessary to place two fingers on the flanks and bring the thumb over the top and grasp the stone with the thumb and the two fingers. Then bring the thumb and two fingers back to their original place and grasp the stone with forceps.</start_of_turn
In some cases it is necessary to push the stone down the neck of the bladder to cause the urine to pass. If the urine does not pass as mentioned and the situation becomes severe, it is necessary to use an instrument called a catheter to remove the stone.</start_of_turn
The surgeon shall make an incision from the flank and advance it along the abdominal cavity until he reaches the liver, which is like a tube of birds' beaks in its length and has a slight bulge at its head. The bowel is attracted to this and takes hold of two intestines, which he ties at their ends with silk thread or pieces of gut.
The thread is passed down through the intestines and is secured by a clamp if any portion of the bowel remains outside the tube. It is then withdrawn into the tube, which is closed with butter, oil, or egg white. The patient is then seated on a chair.
The patient is given a laxative and he is made to drink plenty of water or oil. The intestines are then introduced into the rectum up to the origin of the rectum, and the rectum is closed at the top and opened at the bottom. The intestines are then drawn through the opening and the rectum is closed again
Until the rectum is closed and the intestines are drawn through it until they are close to the buttock. The bowel is then pushed downwards and enters the rectum, and the surgeon examines the wound to ensure that the intestines are completely within the rectum.
This procedure is undertaken because the bowel which contains the urine is tense. The thread is tightly tied in the bowel, so that the urine follows the bowel. It is then withdrawn and the urine is discharged. The intestines are then returned to their original position
This process is repeated until the bladder is empty and the patient feels relief.
Chapter 95.
How to drain the bladder with a catheter.
The instruments used for this procedure are made from either metal or ivory and have a long tube on the side. It is used to drain urine and medications. This is called a catheter and this is its appearance:
The surgeon makes an incision from the armpit to the nipple, along the contour of the breast, and all the veins are ligated except for the tip, which is left open with three holes, two from one side and one from the other, as the practitioner sees fit.
The area which contains the fat is sutured to the extent that it will not be liable to any additional swelling, except when something of a fluid nature is drawn out of it, or when something has become swollen and protruded beyond the point of suture.
If you wish to evacuate the fluid from the bladder, you insert the thumb of the dressing into the urine and draw it upwards until the urine is collected in the palm of the hand. Then you insert the thumb into the orifice according to what has been described previously and evacuate the urine using the thumb
When the fluid reaches the bladder, the sensation will be slight, and this is a delicate position also in the bladder itself.
The surgeon makes an incision from the armpit to the nipple, along the contour of the breast, and all the veins are ligated except for the tip, which is left open with three holes, two from one side and one from the other, as the practitioner sees fit.
The surgeon makes an incision from the armpit to the nipple, along the contour of the breast, and all the veins are ligated except for the tip, which is left open with three holes, two from one side and one from the other, as the practitioner sees fit. The fluid is warmed slightly and then the surgeon inserts the needle into the bladder and ties off the vein with the thread. The patient is then asked to contract the bladder muscle until the fluid is evacuated
If the bladder does not empty, take a loop of the cord and make a circle of it and pass the thread through the holes as it is being wound up, then gather the loop as you would gather a wound after you have placed whatever liquid or ointment or water you wish inside it
Then bind it in an instrument and fashion it as you would with an example from your time until the moisture reaches the benchmark.
The stone is separated.
From the outlet of the stone
We have mentioned previously the classification of stones, their treatment, and medications, and we have mentioned the difference between stones that form in the kidney and those that form in the bladder and the signs of each.
The stones that form in the bladder are of a special kind and originate in the urine. I will explain this in detail and briefly
I say that the stones that form in the bladder are more prevalent among patients and their sign is that the urine comes out of the bladder like water in its flow
There is sand in it that is visible and causes pain and discomfort. Many times it causes vomiting and straining in many people. Many children have it until they are fourteen years old. It is common among adolescents and infrequent among adults.
The larger the stone, the easier its treatment. If we are to treat it, we must first drain all the pus from the wound so that there is no stone left when we open it
Then we take the urine bag and throw it down so that the stone descends into the neck of the bladder or comes out from a high place several times. We then place it between your hands in the middle and your hands under your knees so that the bladder becomes tilted downwards, and then we open it
And if you feel the stone in the space, then immediately close the hour glass over it if it does not fall under the thumb of the palm of your hand. If it does not fall under the thumb of your middle finger, then smear your left thumb or middle finger with fat if the urine is of a child or with your middle finger.
If a testicle is completely descended into the scrotum, enter it into its seat and explore for the stone until it reaches under your thumb. Then move it slightly upwards to the root of the testicles and compress it with your thumb, pushing it outwards towards the desired area for incision.
Command the servant to grasp the testicles with his hand and command another servant to extend his right thumb and index finger above and his left thumb and index finger under the testicles. Then take the needle and pass it through this situation
The incision is made between the scrotum and the testicles, not in the middle, but to the left of the median. The incision is on the same side as the thumb and index finger, and the thumb is used to compress the testicle outwards, making the incision as wide as possible.
There is no greater swelling in the testicles when the thumb is compressed at the scrotum during the incision, and it comes out without difficulty. Know that there may be angles and letters in the stone that make it difficult for it to come out.
It is like a pearl that is smooth and slippery, which makes it easy to expel. But if there are angles and letters on it, it will be difficult to remove it, and it may be necessary to hold it firmly or grasp it with forceps.</start_of_turn>
To adjust the stone so that it does not slip away, or to enter under it with a fine curved instrument, grasp it firmly. If you are unable to grasp it, widen the incision slightly, as a little bleeding is better than leaving the stone inside.</start_of_turn>
If there are more than one, remove the larger one first to the mouth of the testicles, then make an incision and remove the smaller one afterwards. Do the same if there are more than two. If there is a large one, do not attempt to make a large incision, as this exposes unnecessary risks.</start_of_turn>
If the bladder is threatened with rupture, it must be emptied constantly to prevent contamination of the surrounding tissues. Attempt to evacuate its contents until they pass naturally or break within its fracture by percussion until they are expelled in pieces.

Handle the stone with your hand within the kidney and rotate it slightly until you penetrate it through the opposite side, for if the urine comes out from its hour, then close your hand over what remains of the stone outside the tube and it will disintegrate and come out with the urine, healing the pain.
If this treatment does not suit you due to other obstacles, tie a thread under the stone and another thread over the stone, then make an incision in the kidney between the two threads and extract it.</start_of_turn>
Then loosen the ligature and wash out the blood clot that has formed in the wound, for if the thread under the stone is not removed, it may return to the bladder and the other thread from above so that when the thread is cut after the stone has gone, the skin will return to its place to cover the wound.</start_of_turn>
And for that matter, if you have tied the upper thread, you must lift the skin upwards to return it when you are finished and cover the wound as we have said.</start_of_turn>
The Stone Chapter
In the Ejaculation of Stones in Women.</start_of_turn>
A little of what is said about the stone in women is that its width often hinders its treatment and deters many of them from consulting a physician. Perhaps a woman may be pregnant or may be menstruating, and you will not find a woman who will readily consent to such an operation.</start_of_turn
If she is a virgin or one of moderate age and has a full bladder, you will not find a woman who will consent to such an operation, especially when it is done by hand and with the needle. For the position of the incision on the stone in women is far from the position of the stone itself, and it requires a deeper incision.</start_of_turn
In such cases, if need be, a woman may take on the role of a physician. Few women are capable of this, but if none other is found, she should consult with an experienced physician who is a colleague or ask a capable woman who is experienced in women's matters.
She must be consulted and commanded to make all necessary examinations, such as probing the kidney or stone, for if she is a virgin, she must put her finger into her private parts and examine the stone.
She must be commanded to split open the affected area. If she is not a virgin, she should ask the experienced physician to insert a finger into the belly and examine the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and contracting it well
If she finds it, she must extract it from the bladder outlet down to the hip joint and then perform an incision at the junction of the hip bone on either side of the buttock where the stone is located and remove it from that area
Her finger remains in contact with the stone compressed under it, but the incision is small. She should then insert the probe into the small incision. If she feels the stone, she should enlarge the incision to the extent that she believes the stone will come out, and she should know that there are various types of stones
There are small, large, coarse, rough, long, and flat stones. You should know their types in order to determine what is appropriate in each case. If there is bleeding, let the clot settle for an hour before proceeding. Then return to your work
Until the stone comes out, and be aware of the instruments that are used for extracting stones from men and use them to your advantage. If there is bleeding and you know that the vein has been cut, put a compress on the area
If the wound is severe and there is abundant bleeding, do not close it immediately. Leave it open and do not apply any pressure. Do not extract any stones until the bleeding has subsided. If the bleeding stops after some days, dress the wound and return to your work until the stone is naturally expelled.
The second part and the stone.
In the area of the large intestine
The large intestine is a collection of fluid in the white belly which lies under the surrounding fatty tissue and is called the mesentery. It may be within a specific membrane that facilitates its natural function in the belly
Until it is suspected to be an egg and is between the fatty tissue under the belly and the white belly which we mentioned earlier. This large intestine originates from weakness and exposure to women, so it is filled with this matter. It may be injured by a blow to the women
This fluid is of many colors, sometimes it is yellow, or reddish-brown, or black, or white. This is most likely the case, and the signs indicating this.
Where water and other matters meet in the white belly which we mentioned earlier, the swelling becomes large and resembles an egg. The fatty tissue surrounding it is not visible because the fluid surrounds it from all sides
If the fluid is within a specific membrane that has its own pocket, the swelling will be large in one area of the egg
A person may think that it is an egg because of its appearance, but if the fluid is between the fatty tissue under the belly and the white belly, it lies under the sensation. If you want to know the color of the fluid, take a square scoop of the swelling and bring it to me to see what color it is that comes out after the scoop has been taken
If the ailment permits, command the patient to sit upright, then place his body on a low stool. Place a large fracture under his abdomen and sit beside him.
Command the attendant to sit on his right side and extend his arm towards the lower part of the abdomen. Place a wide bandage under the abdominal area and grasp the scissors from the middle of the abdomen towards the waist
The incision is made in a straight line parallel to the line that divides the abdomen into two halves, until it reaches the white fatty membrane covering the intestines. Break through this membrane and preserve its integrity. Close the opening with stitches as much as possible.</start_of_turn>
Then fill the cavity with a large amount of fluid and drain all the fluid. Separate the layers of the incision with sutures and pull the membrane up without injuring the abdominal cavity. Cut the membrane as much as possible, either in one piece or in small pieces.</start_of_turn>
Do not leave the thin side, for if you do not cut it, the water will not drain out. If the intestines protrude outside the skin during the process, when you finish cutting the membrane, collect the intestines and close the incision.</start_of_turn>
Then complete the treatment of all the wounds until the patient is healed. If the intestines have become infected with another disease, join the blood vessels that are in contact, cut the spleen from the contact point, remove the intestines, and treat them as mentioned above.</start_of_turn>
If there is water in both places, know that the infection has increased. Cut the other side as you did the first time, whether you think it is necessary or not, and then wash the blood.</start_of_turn>
Cotton is introduced into the wound soaked in oil or balm, and is covered with another layer of cotton soaked in wine and oil. It is spread over the abdomen and the lower part of the body, and the abdomen is examined to ensure the dressing is secure. It is secured from above with a bandage which has six corners in this image.
Then two incisions are taken and the cotton is filled in like this, and the corners are secured with thread or cotton wool and gathered into a belt around the waist. One of the corners is taken to the back
and the other two corners are taken towards the abdomen and the lower parts of the thighs from below and the remaining two corners on the flanks and gather the thread altogether in a belt around the waist. This bandage can also be made with yarn instead of needlework
And a small incision is taken with a blunt needle at the lower part of the abdomen and it is covered with what we have mentioned until the white peritoneum of the water is exposed, then another layer is taken on this fashion
It is like the Greek eye, and then it is closed with that peritoneum and it is protected until all the moisture comes out, then the peritoneum is stretched with forceps and the surrounding tissue is divided and cut as much as possible until it reaches the end of the process.
And know that this work is safe and prevents bleeding and is better than work with a knife, for if you encounter any difficulty in the process of the incision or at the time of the knot or a hot wound or bleeding or anything else that may impede you, then all of that must be treated and what is appropriate for that must be done.
If the ailment is stubborn and you are unable to bear the workload due to its familiarity, do not proceed with the work.

If a wound is closed with your fingers and does not need to be exposed to the incision, and if there is any swelling of the vessels, it does not change anything in relation to the closure of the fingers. This type may be divided on all parts.
When the skin is split and the yolk is drawn up above, then it is brought out from the white sac and the intestines are freed from the vessels. The vessels are then tied off and cut after they have been freed from all sides of the yolk
It is not permissible to remove the yolk and cut it, even if there is an adhesion between some of the sacs or between the vessels. In this case, all of the adhesion must be released and cut off
If the fat of the meat is in the place of adhesion which is behind, it is necessary to cut all of it and remove the yolk as we have said. If you do the work well, cover the wound with wool soaked in fat and resin, and keep it clean until it heals
Wound and stone.
In the treatment of wounds that contain stones
A swelling which is like some cobbles and causes stiffness of the joints, hinders movement, walking and running. In the treatment of this ailment from afar is mentioned in this book.
However, it is necessary to mention what is done in the beginning. I say that it is necessary to sit on a high chair, then push down the joint of the toes towards the heel and grasp the skin of the thigh with your fingers along with the vessels that are close to the hip bone.
He grasps it with his servant and stretches it out for a while, then cuts it with a broad knife parallel to the vessel until the vessels are exposed, and then frees them from all sides as I have mentioned previously, and sews them with a needle and thread which is like that of the intestines
Connect it at the first site where it shows weakness and connect it also at the last, then make a cut in the middle parallel to the body and extract whatever is putrefying there.
Then treat the abscess with the treatment of all surgeons who wish to take charge of it, for it is permissible to leave some of the vessels untied, for if the abscess extends to all of the vessels, one of them must be extracted along with the vessels to prevent malnutrition.</start_of_turn> Before cutting the vessels, let it be swollen and useless, for it will not benefit from its cutting.</start_of_turn>
A fifth and a sixth portion.
In the treatment of intestinal worms.</start_of_turn>
This worm appears when a cut reveals it in the abdominal cavity towards the flanks of the belly, where the intestine hangs down. The intestine is then pulled out through this opening to one of the veins.</start_of_turn
This opening may be either from the incision of the peritoneum or from its expansion. This happens in many causes, either a blow or a swelling or pain or raising something heavy, and the like. Its sign is that if it is from the expansion of the peritoneum, it rarely happens in a long time.</start_of_turn
It does not happen suddenly but becomes apparent as it deepens from the time the peritoneum tightens the intestine, and its sign is that if it is from the incision of the peritoneum, it appears from the beginning and is large, pushing outwards and appearing different under the skin near the surface.</start_of_turn
And thus the intestine and its mesentery come out of the peritoneum, and it may come out with blood, and this is called intestinal and bloody worms. It may also be with pus, and there may be vomiting in the intestine and obstruction, which is with the worms.</start_of_turn
Since it is difficult and painful, especially in the evening, treatment for these ailments requires great caution. The instruction is that the physician should order the patient to pass the bowel into his belly if it returns.
Then he should place his hands upon the flanks between the thighs and elevate the legs, and then stretch the skin over the abdomen to the navel and split the skin of the navel with the whole length, and pierce with hooks as much as is necessary to open the wound
The wound should be made as large as possible to allow the passage of feces, and the peritoneum under the navel skin should be stripped until the white membrane of the spleen is exposed on every side. Then insert your index finger into what is beneath the feces
Between the white membrane which is under the navel skin and the second peritoneum, release the adhesion which is behind the feces. Then grasp with the right hand towards the inside of the abdomen and with this elevate the spleen with the left hand and bring the feces with the peritoneum to the level of the wound.
Order the attendant to pull out the feces to above and release the adhesion which is behind complete evacuation and explore with your fingers lest there be any remaining intestines in the white membrane of the spleen. If there is anything left, remove it from the abdomen below
Then take a needle with a thick thread which has been cut from ten threads and pass it through the end of the peritoneum which is under the navel which is over the wound, and then cut off the branches of the thread until there are four threads left. Then gather some of them on some manner and bind them firmly with the peritoneum which we said is under the navel skin from two sides, and tie off the branches of the thread firmly so that nothing can pass through which feeds it If the tumor is soft and movable, it may also be tied a second time outside the first ligation, about two finger-breadths away from it. Then, when these two ligatures are made, the belly that is under the testicles will be as large as a bone of a finger.
If the tumor is soft and movable, it may also be tied a second time outside the first ligation, about two finger-breadths away from it. Then, when these two ligatures are made, the belly that is under the testicles will be as large as a bone of a finger. The rest of it is cut in a circle and the testicles are pulled out with it. Then, a small incision is made under the testicles to let out blood and pus as described previously. Then, wool soaked in oil is used and put in the wound and a ligation is used as described.</start_of_turn>
The white belly that we mentioned previously, after its cutting, will take care of itself in respect of bleeding. It is left to fall by itself. If its descent is slow, it will swell with warm water and carry whatever is causing it until it falls.</start_of_turn>
Then, the wound is treated with all the treatments for wounds until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Sixth and Seventh Chapters.</start_of_turn>
In the rural areas of this land, no one has ever treated such a wound with iron. As for the first part, we mentioned that it should be made as we described in the previous chapter concerning ligation after incision.
Then, an incision is made in the middle and the tumor is treated until the vessels have fallen out. The wound is treated as described previously until it heals.</start_of_turn
Seventh Chapter.</start_of_turn
In the navel of a child.</start_of_turn
The navel may show an opening as we mentioned previously, but it does not go down to the intestines. If it does go down, it is always coming back.
However, if the time prolongs, the incision in the abdomen increases until the intestines protrude through the opening and become visible, indicating the extension of the peritoneum in the abdomen as we mentioned earlier. The peritoneum expands and then relaxes, and the organs settle into their place. The treatment is with a bandage as described previously.</start_of_turn>
It may be treated by a clamp on this sign, which is to put a little pressure on the abdomen between the fingers, then make a cut in the place of the existing opening, three finger-widths wide, and tie the peritoneum under the skin.</start_of_turn>
Until the white peritoneum that follows is exposed, take a bowel and put it on the existing opening of the peritoneum and close it to the depth of the abdomen, then tie the two ends of the peritoneum on the tip of the bowel and suture them together.</start_of_turn>
Then tighten the tip and do not cut the fat peritoneum or touch the egg or anything else as I have taught you in the treatment of abdominal wounds, and then treat it with surgical treatment.</start_of_turn>
If the sutures break, retie them and close the wound until it heals. The peritoneum will shrink and there will be no further expansion of the opening.</start_of_turn
The bandage is better in this place because it is closer to safety.</start_of_turn>
The eighth and ninth chapters.
In the relaxation of the cold testicles.</start_of_turn>
Many people's cold testicles relax without relaxing the organs inside them, which causes them to swell and appear larger. Whoever wishes to treat them should put a little pressure on the abdomen between the fingers.</start_of_turn
Cut all those who have become limp upon the thick skin, then reunite the edges. If you wish, tie the first layer of skin that has become limp with three stitches or four, and secure them from the stitches, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of all surgeons until it heals and the stitches are removed.
Chapter IX: The Stone.
In the testicles.
The testicles in our law are forbidden.
Therefore, if it is necessary for me not to mention it in this book although I have mentioned it for two reasons: the first reason is that it is unlawful in our law. The second reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit
Such as camels, the ibex and cats, and the like of animals. I say that castration is done in two ways: by incision or by cutting. As for the incision method, we place the animal in hot water until the hair becomes limp and soft and then we cut the scrotum
Then we press it with our hands until it softens and does not feel painful when touched. As for castration by cutting, we grasp the testicles and clamp them with the left hand, then cut through each testicle individually
until if two testicles remain, we cut them after they have become detached and do not leave any fat except the thin membrane that is on the vessels. This method of castration is better than the incision method
because it may leave some testicles behind which causes the animal to remain sexually excited. Then we treat the wound until it heals.
Seventh Chapter.
In the Treatment of Wounds.
Wounds may occur in two varieties: one that shows itself on the surface or in the abdominal cavity between the intestines, resembling a woman's navel with hair and urine escaping from it.
And as for women, there is one variety which appears above the navel like a small boy's testicle, and it is caused by the bursting of one of the intestines like a man's wound, and two of them like the intestines of women. The treatment of the three varieties is different.</start_of_turn>
The two varieties of wound and the one in women require that the intestines be cut until the effect of the wound is gone, and then the wound is treated like any other wound until it is healed. As for the third variety which is in men and from which urine comes from the abdominal cavity, there is no need to perform any operation or incision.</start_of_turn>
Seventh Chapter ends here.
And on the cutting of bones and flesh resulting from the bursting of women's intestines.</start_of_turn>
The swelling may increase in quantity, causing a natural obstacle, and obscuring the view. It may also solidify in some women, becoming like men and spreading outwards.</start_of_turn
It is necessary to hold the swelling with your hand or forceps and cut it without any concern for the depth of the incision, for it does not bleed significantly.</start_of_turn
And the surrounding tissue is treated like other wounds until it heals. As for the excised tissue, it is like the flesh of the womb which fills the cavity.</start_of_turn
If the wound has protruded outwards, like a swelling. The swelling which has protruded outwards is called by some the first disease of swelling, and it must be cut out like a boil and treated until it heals.</start_of_turn>
The second and seventh chapters.</start_of_turn>
On treating swelling.</start_of_turn>
Swelling is when the woman's belly is not emptied or when the wound is small and either natural or caused by an injury, and it is either from a delayed progress or from an excess of meat from a navel.</start_of_turn
Or the swelling is watery or thick and is either in the depth of the abdomen or on the sides or above or below and it hinders coition and procreation and childbirth and perhaps prevents menstruation, and this must be known.</start_of_turn
If the swelling is close to the surface, but is not visible, it can be opened with the fingers or with a hook. If the swelling is watery and is close to the flanks, it should be opened by making the flanks resemble swellings, and then place two thumbs from both hands together.</start_of_turn
A woman should sit with her legs spread wide and then stretch out her flanks with force until the watery swelling bursts. Then take cotton wool and soak it in oil and put it on the wound and change it every day so that the wound does not become infected again.</start_of_turn
If the swelling is thick and tough, it must be cut with a broad knife resembling a sheet of iron. If the swelling is from excess navel, it should be cauterized with needles and cut out. Take medications that relieve bleeding such as cloves, alum and egg white together with white lead.</start_of_turn
A wide-mouthed tube of lead is used to prevent the wound from closing too quickly, and to hold it in place. A small piece of cotton is then placed on the wound and treated with all the available treatments until it heals. Sometimes there is a plant or other substance in the uterus which necessitates its removal at this point.
If it is not a cancerous tumor, but there is a tumor in the uterus which is not indicated by the palpation, it does not necessitate its removal at this point.
The third and seventh chapters.
In the treatment of piles, fistula and hemorrhoids which occur in women's menses
Or the bleeding from the veins becomes excessive so that blood flows constantly, and if the piles are protruded, they become fistula, and it has been mentioned previously about the types and signs of piles and we will mention it here.
What is not curable and what is not treated? I say that piles and fistula which are in the depth of the uterus and have not manifested any sensation do not require treatment, and what is in the mouth of the uterus concerning them is what causes sensation, and that is what is treated.
The woman should be brought into the warm house and the fistula should be stretched out with a hook or a scraper and cut from its roots and then let go when bleeding stops from any of the ruptured arteries without causing renewed bleeding
Like vomit, saliva and pus and similar things should be done, and then elevate the legs for an hour, then bathe her in cold water, and if bleeding persists, put her in the position of the patient with application of powder and alum, and similar things should be done, and then take a hair from the beard and mix it with honey and apply it on her.
If the blood supply to the back is cut or weakened, and the solid and fluid contents of the intestines and abdomen are not otherwise affected, take an abdominal cavity and fill it with either barley broth or tongue broth or grape must with vinegar and keep the position fixed.
If the swelling is severe and the position is painful, apply pressure to it until it subsides, and as for the red swelling which resembles the heads of worms in their appearance, cut away whatever is visible of it as described in the principles, and treat until it subsides.
The thigh and the loin.
In the belly of the abscess which shows in the abdomen.
It may show in the abdomen various kinds of tumors such as cancer, abscess, fistula, wound, tumor, hernia and swelling, and it has been mentioned that all these diseases and their signs have been described in their classification
We must mention in this article the swelling which appears in the abdomen if it is from tumors that have accumulated over time, how it is identified, and what its signs are. Observe whether it is sudden or gradual, accompanied by pain, swelling and fever
Or if it is red, and it occurs with pain, do not delay its treatment until the pain subsides. Place the patient on a chair with two cushions and support her back.
Gather her legs towards the lower abdomen and make her thighs parallel to the floor and her arms under her armpits and tie them with a bandage that reaches her navel
For this reason then sit the patient from the right side and use the instrument which opens the mouth of the uterus, and which will appear later. If you intend to use this instrument, advance it steadily into the depth of the uterus so that what enters through the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
If the instrument is larger in diameter than the depth of the wound, the hook should be placed on the nape of the neck to prevent the instrument from entering too deeply. The loop which is carried out with the instrument should be performed from the upper side.
While holding the instrument and rotating the assistant's loop, open the abdomen until the cavity is exposed. If purulent matter appears and is grasped by the hand, and there is concern that it might escape, the opening should be widened at its apex with a broad blade and if all the matter has drained out
The opening should be made in the wound and a fine silk suture should be passed through fat in the armpit or olive oil with some adhesive, and the suture should be passed out through the incision in the neck and be secured outside the abdomen, and outside the uterus a piece of cotton wool should be placed and soaked in hot water with alum.
And then the wound should be treated after two days with an ointment that is suitable for that until it heals.
The abdomen and the wound should be washed and oiled with vinegar and then with hot water with alum, and then covered with a thick ointment, if the purulent matter has gone down inside the abdomen
It should not be treated with iron but should be treated with what has been mentioned previously
Fifth and seventh chapters.
On teaching the knots how to treat living beings if they deviate from the natural way
The hook must know or first the natural mode of birth, for a sign of it is that if a woman leans downwards and sighs, and blows air and sighs, this is abnormal
It is easier for the child to be born if you know that this birth is natural and the head will come out with the navel cord attached or hanging from its head, so if you see these signs, you must stop the abdomen so that the child comes out quickly.
If the foetus descends upon the head, the limb will descend with it and cleanse itself from the filth of the belly. This birth is unnatural and perilous, for the limb may issue forth before the head and the limbs.
The limb or a foot or the head may issue forth before the hand and foot or the belly may twist and turn like that, which are perilous shapes. In such a case, the midwife must be vigilant and cautious with regard to all these things, for she must fear the defects and mistakes.</start_of_turn>
I explain each form of it and how to deal with it. If the foetus issues forth naturally through the head, the woman must strengthen herself and be cautious, for I have seen that her strength has waned and I have sat her on a chair and commanded the women to support her.</start_of_turn>
Her loins and flanks are swollen and soft, and the hand or foot enters between her fingers cautiously and grasps the limb or the placenta, delivering the foetus or tearing the placenta with her nail until the moisture flows out and she closes the woman's belly until the foetus descends.</start_of_turn>
If it does not descend, she must give the woman a dose of the lobe with butter and then command her to move and give her some laudanum and hold her mouth and nose, for if the limb issues forth first, she must be delivered with a little pressure.</start_of_turn>
If she does not come down, put the woman on a couch and elevate her legs above the level of the heart, then shake the couch on the ground and the woman hold still so as not to slip, and if the hand or foot does not issue forth, grasp the remainder of the foetus and draw it out.</start_of_turn>
If the limb is fractured and the bone protrudes, bind the hand and forearm together with attention to detail. If the bone protrudes on the forearm, it is necessary to elevate both bones and rotate them slightly until they are aligned. Then, grasp one bone and extend it slightly.
If the bones protrude towards the thigh, command them to relax and support them with bandages. If the bone does not protrude as described, gradually rotate the limb until it is aligned. The bone will then protrude smoothly. If this does not occur despite all measures, elevate the limb slightly until the deformity is corrected naturally.
Grasp the limb firmly at the hip, knee and ankle joints and apply ointment to the area. Wrap everything tightly in a basin with a strong bath. Then, raise the limb above the level of the woman’s heart and lower it over her abdomen. Place her in a basin of cold water until the swelling subsides
If you see that the swelling has gone down, make her a bandage and hold it firmly. If you leave the bandage on for an hour, seat her on a chair, then support her and obstruct her mouth and nose. Tighten the bandage on her abdomen slightly, as the bone will naturally come out through the joints of the leg and hand. The bone will protrude on both the ankle and forearm
If the bone now comes out in this manner, slightly flex the hand. Then seat the woman on a cushion and support her ankles. Hold her calves down towards the foot of the bed and keep her relaxed. Grasp the hand and pull it slightly towards the abdomen. Then pull out whatever is under the ankle until the lower limb is suspended. If the bone does not protrude, grasp both ankles and move them vigorously. Then tighten the abdomen slightly until the bone comes out. Insert the hand into the hole and align the bone slightly.
I command the woman to withdraw until the fetus emerges, as the fetus emerges contrary to the model of one of her hands, occupying the back of her hand. If she is unable to move her hand back, she should make her passive and allow her to walk. If she is unable to walk, she should lie down.
I command the woman to withdraw until the fetus emerges. The fetus emerges contrary to the model of one of her hands, occupying the back of her hand. If she is unable to move her hand back, she should make her passive and allow her to sit. Then, she should use the towels which were described among the instruments and place them under her armpits. She should then be raised onto a chair and the fetus should be repositioned in its normal position. I then instruct the woman to withdraw until the fetus comes out.
The fetus emerges on its palm with one hand facing downwards and its face towards the mother's back. The hand of the fetus should be grasped and pulled slightly and then repositioned slightly. If she lies still, carry her under the armpits as described previously.
Then she should move slightly. If she does this, I command her to sit on the chair and instruct her to lean towards the right side. Then I command her to withdraw until the fetus comes out, as the fetus emerges normally from the flank
If she reaches the birth opening in this manner with walking, open the birth opening with your thumb until the fetus is expelled from the womb. If it adheres to the face and neck of the fetus, do not grasp it tightly but rather pull it gently. Then deliver the fetus into the inside until it is delivered naturally
I command the woman to withdraw several times until it comes out easily. The coming out of twins or many fetuses is common. Know that twins often come out and sometimes three or four live, but this is something extraordinary and does not happen naturally.
If many wounds are close together and intersect each other, they are related to the beds of each one of them. They may erupt like a natural birth and erupt in sequence as we have described.
If some of them are close at birth and turn out to be other than the natural forms, as we have described, they will be soft and will do what is proper for them, following their trend and conforming to all forms, whatever befits them of adjunctive measures for safety.
Mention what is in the womb of the creatures that erupt, for they may erupt in one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or more than ten. And indeed it is correct that a woman has erupted seven and another fifteen, all of them being erupted together.
We praise God for the knowledge, for this is all that is proper for the learned who are acquainted with such things as this, that occurs today and passes away tomorrow, and whatever befalls it is as it should be.
The Sixth and Seventh Chapters.
On the Eruption of the Dead Embryo
If you treat the dead embryo as mentioned in the previous division concerning treatment, and you do not touch it with your hand, there will remain no need for work. But if the woman is strong and healthy and there is no fear of any of the ailments that frighten her, she should lie down on her back on the bed
Then her head will be tilted downwards and her legs will be elevated, and a servant should grasp her from both sides or bind her to the bed so that her body does not slip from beneath the fetus
Then apply unguents of warm fat and gum resin with saliva and lead and saffron, and then put on her belly and request a place where the fetuses will be grasped from. The attendants should agree to this position
If the fetus is in a lateral position and its head is descending towards its eyes, nose, mouth, ear, under the jaw, or in the armpits, or under the scapulae, its limbs should be flexed.
If it is found head downwards in the abdomen or lower extremities, the thumb should be grasped with the right hand, its tip placed between the index and middle fingers of the left hand, and the hand should be introduced into the fetus's body and the clamp inserted into some of the positions mentioned above.
Until something solid is reached, then insert another clamp or three, if necessary, so that the traction is even and does not slant, and that the body is neither too flexed nor extended, but is rather moved in all directions.
It is easier to extrude it as we did with the teeth at its root. It is necessary between this that the limb should be relaxed, and if you hold it in a direction, you must lubricate some of the nails and insert them from the side to direct what is held so that if some of the fetus comes out, the forceps can be moved to other places.
It is better to do this only when the fetus is completely expelled, for if the limb comes out before the others and cannot be retracted due to its tension, you must cut it off then draw it out.
Either at the wrist or the ankle, or in both hands and feet, if the fetus's head is large and there is pressure in its expulsion, or if there is water in its head, you must pass between the fingers cautiously.
And pierce its head in expulsion, or drain it with the instrument called the dilator, which comes with the other instruments in the bag that follows this description.
If the head of the patient is large, make an incision at the jugular angle or in the neck as we have mentioned. Then extract the bones through the opening. If the head is dislocated at the nape of the neck, make an incision until the cavity of the chest is exposed.
If the chest does not expand when the patient inhales, make additional incisions as necessary until the chest can expand adequately.
If the patient is sitting on his legs, his thighs are easily movable and can be brought to the navel. If the head or chest is displaced, make an incision with a hook knife over the area that you suspect and cut through the skin until the fluid escapes
If all the organs have been removed and the head is brought back, if the left forearm is open, insert the hand into the navel and grasp the head with the thumb and fingers. Then insert a tube or two through the opening and grasp them with the hand.
If the navel has become swollen due to a wound or other ailment, do not attempt to dilate it. Rather, use sponges soaked in warm water, apply pressure and sit in water that is deep enough to cover the affected area
If the patient is lying on his side, it is possible to move him without difficulty. If this is not possible, cut through the tissue and remove the wound. Ensure that no part of the placenta remains inside the abdomen. After completing treatment, use the methods mentioned for treating tumors in the abdomen
If blood is spurting, descend into the deep water and utilize all other treatments. I have seen a woman who had delivered a child into her womb and delivered another child shortly thereafter.
The other animal also exhibits the same symptoms after a long time, and a swelling in its belly. It distends until it bursts open, thus restoring the discharge of the pus to its healing. It becomes effective in this way for a long period of time, without completing the healing process. It leaves behind some powerful absorbents.
It comes out from the bone, and proceeds for some days. Another bone then emerges and is expelled from that place because of the swelling. It has been seen to expel many bones from the head of the animal that has died.
It did not cease until it expelled many bones. The woman was in her best condition, and she survived for a long time thereafter. This is a rare event indeed
because there is knowledge and skill in what the surgeon attempts with his hand in the treatment
Seventh and Eighth Chapters.
Here are images of the instruments that are needed for the evacuation of the animal
Image of a clamp that opens the mouth of the uterus
This clamp is used to stabilize the books, whether they are of two horns at the extremities of the limb or one horn of bone and one of cartilage. The width of each horn should be as thick as two fingers
Their height towards the fingers is about half a palm, and their length is greater or less. The width of the horn is towards the fingers or less. These two horns are of the same kind as the limb itself. If their length is half a palm or more, and their width is towards the fingers or less, these two horns are sufficient
These two which enter the mouth of the uterus to open it, are like other instruments such as the clamp and the hook, which are smaller
Construct the uterus from acacia branches or bones, shaping them like spheres, except that in each one there are two orifices like those you see on each of them towards the navel. The length of each orifice is towards the navel and its width is two fingers.
Construct the uterus from acacia branches or bones, shaping them like spheres, except that in each one there are two orifices like those you see on each of them towards the navel. The length of each orifice is towards the navel and its width is two fingers. Place the woman sitting on a cushion with her legs extended and spread between her legs. Then insert these two orifices into the mouth of the uterus and grasp the lower handle between her buttocks and open your hand as you do with spheres, whether you wish to open the uterus as much as you like. Until you have constructed the uterus as much as you like, like the initial loop mentioned
The image of the fetus that pushes against it
The image of the fetus that pulls its head towards it
It resembles a pair of teeth at the end as you see. It has been made in a straight line like spheres in this image as you see, with teeth like those of a saw that cut and tear with it
The image of pushing also
The image of a loop
This loop should have little bulk to prevent it from breaking when the fetus is grasped with it, like a loop with two handles.
The image of two wide handles to cut the fetus
These instruments, all of them, whenever their types increase, become more useful for the surgeon and more expensive for people in general. It is not necessary for every surgeon to have all of them, but it is necessary for them to be available when needed
Chapter Eight and Seven.
On Excision of the Uterus.
If the uterus becomes congested after expulsion, the matron should command her to hold still and then expel it with forceps. She should grasp the hand over her mouth and chin, and if it comes out easily, well and good; otherwise take hold of it.
Close the wound and insert sponges moistened with wine into the opening of the uterus like sponges, chaff, alum, pomegranate seeds, chamomile and alum, and cover the lower part of the wound with a silver tube, and the upper part in the mouth of the uterus
And keep holding it until the vapor reaches the bottom of the uterus, and then expel it as we mentioned. If the uterus comes out quickly, well and good; otherwise command the attendant to put her left hand in ghee or vinegar from the tip of the thumb to the wrist
Then insert her hand into the wound and grasp the uterus firmly. If she grasps it tightly and pulls it slightly until it comes out. If it is deeply embedded in the uterus, insert a hand as we mentioned until you find the uterus, and if you do not find it, grasp it slightly and pull it out slowly.
So that the uterus does not slip during the strong grasp, it is best to transport it to the sides right and left, then increase the amount of the grasp. If it responds at that time and frees itself from the adhesion, it will have escaped. If the mouth of the uterus is wide, we have described the treatment by irrigation and dressing and sponges.
If it does not come out as we described, command the attendant to grasp it again but bind what comes out to the mouth of the uterus to the woman's thigh. Then pour oil over it, for it softens after a few days.
If the wound is closed and the discharge has ceased, except when infection is suspected, for infection causes an offensive odor to emanate from the wound to the abdomen and head, which is detrimental to the patient. Therefore, appropriate dressing should be used.
Therefore, some of the early physicians used to apply wool and lint dressing, as well as sponges, which resemble the instrument women use to boil milk when they are breastfeeding their children, and the like of these things.
These are made of cotton wool or are made of lead, with the narrow end in the belly and the wide end on the fire and smoke which are made by the burning of resin. The smoke is held on the wound until it disappears, and the rest is expelled
The Ninth and Seventh Chapters.
In the treatment of non-inflammatory fistula
Many young patients and women with fistulas often obstruct them with a thin fluid, so the cavity must grasp that fluid with its fingers or else bind it with a strong bandage without damaging the tissue.
Then put over it a soft sponge soaked in broth and oil, and treat it with drugs until it heals. If you fear that it will obstruct, put in the opening an iron tube of any size and remove it whenever you wish
The fistula may also be obstructed by tumor or swelling, so it is necessary to excise that tumor or swelling and then treat as mentioned above
The Eighth Chapter
In the treatment of wounds that occur in the lower part of the body
The wounds that occur in the lower part of the body are complex and dense, and are caused by infection from outside or inside the cavity and are single or multiple
If the swelling persists, make an incision and let out the excessive moisture, which is white or purulent. Sometimes these pus pockets may extend to the bowels and stomach, and sometimes not. The pus which comes out with slight pressure from the incision is known as stool or urine.
Sometimes there may be worms [visible] in the pus which comes out, and sometimes there are pus pockets which are spread throughout the abdomen and limbs, such as in the hip joint or knee, and sometimes they are spread throughout the buttocks. The pus which is known as stool or urine comes out with slight pressure from the incision.
Insert your fingers gently into the rectum and insert a little spatula of mercury into the pus pocket from the navel or from iron if there is no pus pocket, and if there is pus pocket insert a little spatula of mercury or hair from hair of a horse
Until you feel the spatula or hair in your fingers, and until you do not see anything coming out of the incision – no stool, urine or worms as we mentioned – then know that it is not spread and proceed to treatment.
If the pus pocket is spread to the intestines or urinary tract, do not allow urine to come out of it, and do not administer any medication which may obstruct the discharge. As for the hip joint or knee, if the pus pocket is there, insert the spatula into that area
If there is no bone fracture and there is pain in that area and purulent discharge comes out of it, always know that there is no benefit in treatment or that it will not obstruct the pus discharge. All these spread pus pockets are like that, and there is no benefit in treatment for them
Treatment for it is in the hands of the learned physicians, and as for the one which is not spread and is not dangerous, be content with the mark which I have set on it and do not do anything which may cause you further pain.
If the limb is elevated above the level of the heart, insert the trocar or needle through the navel until it reaches the desired depth. When the trocar or needle is withdrawn, if sensation returns to the seat, it is necessary to insert the thumb into the seat.
When sensation returns to the fingers after withdrawal of the trocar or needle, it is known that it has been adequately inserted and that there is no need for further advancement
In some people, the insertion may cause pain at the puncture site. This pain, however, is not serious and is not an indication that the insertion has not been successful.
When all the surrounding fat has been cauterized, like the plumes of a rooster, and it has been treated with a wet dressing until the fat has solidified, then it is treated with salt poultices until it heals
It is not painful in any other way except for this. If you insert the trocar and did not reach the fingers, but there is tissue between the trocar and the fingers that appears white on the surface of the skin, it means that the skin has been perforated from the beginning of the navel When the incision is made with the trocar, and it reaches the navel, but does not reach the fingers, and there is tissue between the trocar and the fingers that turns white on the surface of the skin, this means that the skin has been perforated from the very beginning of the incision
Then it is treated with salt poultices until it heals. It is better to use strong pain relievers such as fire or strong medication than to delay treatment for this reason, as fire and medication gather two sensations that burn those fat tissues.
Hemostasis of blood, swelling of humors, then treatment with clotted material in the region or powdered gypsum mixed with oil until it causes cessation of discharge, then treatment of the wound with the surrounding surrounding sutures of strong thread.
These are drugs which have contraction and swelling reduction properties. If it is not effective, it will not cause healing and will not prevent recurrence. If the lesion has progressed to a deep seated area under the skin's surface, insert your finger into the lesion and explore it.</start_of_turn>
If you feel a foreign body between your finger and the surrounding tissue, and there is fluid or blood nearby, do not attempt to remove it directly. Use only the blunt or pointed instrument, as appropriate, to remove the foreign body from the surrounding area of the wound.
Or you can cut it out completely until it reaches its root to enable the insertion of the clot and treatment from close range. Do not rely on cutting alone, as this may damage the surrounding tissue and cause involuntary discharge of fluid. Then treat as mentioned previously. Sometimes it will heal as mentioned earlier.</start_of_turn>
Or remove the surrounding tissue and suture after cutting as close to the lesion as possible. This can be done using either the finger or other sharp instrument. Then remove all of the clotted material which is in the wound.</start_of_turn>
Then suture the wound completely with the surrounding tissues until it is closed and the lesion is completely contained within the wound. This will make the procedure less painful. The lesion may be left open for a period of time.</start_of_turn>
If you insert your finger into the lesion and it is located on the side facing the surface of the body, grasp the surrounding tissue with forceps of the appropriate size.</start_of_turn
Insert a fine thread from five threads or thereabouts, then insert the needle with the thread into the anus until it reaches the desired depth, if necessary in the crease of the buttocks from within the vicinity.
Insert the thread from five threads or so, then insert the needle with the thread into the anus until it reaches the desired depth, if necessary in the crease of the buttocks from within the vicinity.
If the opening of the anus is not too wide, do not force it too deeply, for this may tear the tissue unnecessarily. Do this only when absolutely necessary. Then make as before until it heals
The opening of the anus should be wide enough to allow the passage of the needle without causing excessive damage to the surrounding tissue.
Deep and wide.
In the depths of the rectum, where blood vessels are severed and the tissue is torn.
The rectum is divided into two parts: either within the buttocks resembling reddish swellings, or large and small, from which blood always flows.
One part is outside the buttocks and the other is inside. The part outside the buttocks is usually dry, while the part inside the buttocks is often moist and sometimes has yellow fluid or blood flowing from it, which is always of a reddish hue
The treatment for the condition inside the buttocks is to order the patient to relax and expel the stool until it appears from the anus. Then grasp and tighten the area around the opening with your fingers and tweezers, and cut through the base of the tissue when the roots are grasped, if there are no roots or if there is little moisture and tension in the area.
Perform an incision with a sharp knife or a piece of broken glass or grasp it with your fingers and cut it off. Then, drain some blood from the surrounding area. Afterwards, close the wound with some fine sutures.
Once the wound has healed, administer appropriate treatment until discharge. If the discharge persists, instill a small amount of alum to promote rapid drainage. When the discharge ceases, remove the dressing and ensure the wound is completely healed.</start_of_turn>
Grasp or clamp the tissue with forceps, cut it, and then treat as described previously until healed. Avoid excessive bleeding by using silk thread and a needle.</start_of_turn>
Then, suture the wound to the surface and pass the needle through the tissue from the opposite side. Wrap the ends of the suture around the base of the needle and tighten the knot firmly without causing damage. Remove the needle and perform this procedure for all but one of the wounds.</start_of_turn>
To drain the blood, place a dry dressing over the wound and apply pressure with the thumb and index finger until the bleeding stops. Then, place a sterile dressing over the wound and hold it in place for a while. Keep the wound still until the bleeding stops. Once the bleeding has ceased, remove the dressing and continue treatment until the wound has healed.</start_of_turn>
And as for treating the wound, there are many methods that can be used to remove the purulent discharge and stop bleeding. If the discharge persists, it is necessary to drain the wound with a needle or forceps until the underlying tissue becomes firm and the scab has disappeared.</start_of_turn>
If it does not subside, treat it until it conforms to what is appropriate, for if it does not subside even with the most severe treatment until it is annihilated, then leave it alone.
The Second and Eighth Chapters.
In the treatment of inverted and non-inverted hernias, swelling and tumors.
A hernia is a rounded elevation on the surface of the body resembling the head of a nail, which is found in all parts of the body, especially in the calves and fingers, and causes pain and discomfort when walking
It is necessary to pierce what surrounds the hernia and fix it with a bandage or silk, and cut away its root. Then treat it, and if it has grown large, bring it out through an opening in the abdomen. As for swelling, the simple one is a small, rough, rounded elevation on the surface of the body
This often occurs in the hands of young boys. Treat it by releasing the swelling and cutting or burning away the tumor with a thread or hair until it falls off. If it has grown large, bring it out with a loop of thread or wire through an opening in the abdomen
The inverted and non-inverted hernias can be treated with the instrument mentioned in the treatment of tumors. As for the tumor, it is also a small, rough elevation on the surface of the body that goes deep under the skin. If it is affected by cold, it feels like a bite of a flea
It is found throughout the body, and most frequently in the hands. Treat it by taking a hook made of ibex horn or a strong needle and making it into the tumor until it encircles the tumor. Then grasp the tumor with the hook until you cut through what surrounds the hernia
The incision is made deep into the tissue and the needle passes out from its origin. If desired, this can be done with a hook needle or an iron on this figure.
The hook needle is higher than the ribcage and the ribcage is relaxed and open, facilitating the passage of the fingers and the grasp of the tissue, and if desired the needle can be held in place with the thumb over the area of the liver in the opening of the liver
The third and eighth ribs.
In the images of the instruments used for suspension in prolapse and hernia and the epiglottis
The needle may be made of silver, tin, copper or iron and may be large or small according to the surgeon's preference The instruments used in the treatment of young children who are prolapsed or have tight or displaced scrota are small, while those for adults are large
The loop which binds the testicles is wide in this area and there is an opening below which enters the scrotum. There is one opening on one side and two on the other side
The size of the opening is variable depending on the thickness of the testicles or the amount of liquid in the wound, and the testicles which make the medicine or the large veins must be made small like a barleycorn
There are many holes as it goes around and between each hole there is a bundle of nerves, then the thread is passed through these holes and a knot is made with the testicles like barleycorn. If the medicine is placed in the head of the needle between the stones and tightened, and the knot is made, this is the appearance of the testicles and the hole
The technique of cauterization is sufficient to fill the wound with resin or ointment, and it is applied liberally. Take care that it is neither too hot nor too cold, and then place the wound on its back and elevate its limbs above the level of the heart.
A piece of lint or bandage is placed under the wound, and the surrounding area is moistened with fat, beeswax, or gum, or the saliva of a dog, or similar substances. Then the cautery is inserted into the wound and held in place with the thumb and index finger of both hands, and pressure is applied until all the material in the wound is evacuated into the bowel
Then the cautery is withdrawn and the wound is rotated, so that the weight of the dressing rests on the surrounding tissue. If the cautery is not carefully removed, it may leave residue behind, and if this is not noticed it will cause pain. If the cautery is applied too deeply it will cause inflammation of the bowel and will prolong healing.
If there is a stricture or tumor in the bowel, the cautery must be applied cautiously and lightly, less than is done for ordinary cautery. This is because the cautery may adhere to the surrounding tissue and cause further damage.
The abdomen and the flank.
In the treatment of surgery.
Surgery is different according to the nature of the case and the location of the wound
There are many things which are used in surgery such as a stone container or a sword or knife or a hook or stick or an arrow and the like of these things
And as for surgery according to the location of the body, it is different for the wound on the head or neck or chest or abdomen or liver and the like of these organs.
I proceed to describe the treatment of certain surgical procedures in order to establish a standard and a rule for all surgeons. I begin with the minor surgical procedures of the head and neck, as the complex procedures will be mentioned later in the third chapter of this book.
When a simple wound occurs in the head and no bone is fractured, if it is of a stone or similar object, and the skin has only been pierced, and the wound is large and swelling is imminent, one should immediately grasp the edge of the wound and isolate it from the surrounding area. One should not delay and should immediately evacuate the blood from the wound to the extent possible, especially if there is a risk of infection due to the presence of surrounding tissue which could be damaged by the evacuation
One must protect the wound from distension and eating fatty foods, for if evacuation is obstructed, one should not eat or drink meat or beverages, and should only consume boiled food with a little vinegar or with wine mixed in it
If swelling occurs due to the blood, carry on the wound if it is soft with blood and has not been changed by air, and if it has been changed by air, carry some plaster.
Until the swelling subsides, keep the wound covered until it heals, if the wound is large and the edges are not approximated by sutures, gather them with stitches as I describe in the abdominal surgery section
If the skin has been stripped of the bone and the bone is not fractured, except for the lower jaw which requires sutures, treat the wound with medicines that promote the healing of solid tissue rather than skin, and order the patient to eat nutritious foods such as fish, barley and dates, etc.
If an abscess occurs in the skin and does not adhere to the bone, cut away all surrounding tissue and grasp it firmly before opening it. If there is any vessel or nerve bleeding from these incisions, do not stop the bleeding with medication but rather open the vessel.
If it is suspected that the abscess has not resolved despite treatment, cut it out entirely and tie off the vessels if necessary. If this does not suffice, leave the abscess open until the bleeding stops. If these incisions are small and superficial, they can be treated simply with medication and need not be closed.
Before closing the wound, the surgeon should take from lanolin, gum or gypsum, three parts of each, mix them together and apply them to the wound while tightening the edges firmly until they adhere securely to each other and the wound is closed adequately.
The wound should be closed with blood and held together with sutures. Keep the wound covered until the bleeding stops. The plaster or bandage may be sufficient alone if there is no significant movement.
This action may also be sufficient in many large incisions if the surgeon carefully positions and secures them, and if the incisions are thin and the bleeding is minimal, especially in summer months.
It is not necessary to place this dressing with the meaning that it has some effective herbs as we mentioned previously, but rather to apply some unguents or a bandage made of fine hair soaked in water and honey until the inflammation subsides, and then treat it with all other treatments until it heals completely
If a fracture occurs with the wound and the limb is mobile, bind the fracture as described previously in cases of head fractures, in neck surgery, or if the wound is in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between a simple and complex fracture
If a vein has been severed in the neck or an artery, and there is no other remedy, do not neglect treatment. Avoid extreme measures such as mustard, saffron, or similar substances, as they can cause further damage to the nerve.
Do not apply anything cold to the wound, as the essence of the nerve is cold and connects to the brain, which is the most important organ. Use medications such as chamomile, bathed in pure water, repeatedly oiled with olive oil or seasoned with alum and rosewater.</start_of_turn>
If you wash it with pure water and other metallic salts on this ailment, and moisten with thick substances like gum or resin, and if the wound is large, use sutures or bind its edges together with silk thread, and then treat it until it heals.</start_of_turn>
If there is pus accumulating at the bottom of the wound, it has become infected. If a vein has been severed and blood is leaking from it, stop the bleeding or bind it up or clamp it if necessary.</start_of_turn>
If the vein has been severed by some of the lower jaw bones or all of them, gather the edges of the skin with sutures on the neck and do not touch the jawbone but support it with a bandage and keep it in its natural position, then tighten it firmly and hold it in place for several days.</start_of_turn>
Then treat with the above-mentioned medications until it heals. If there are fragments of bone remaining, remove them all or as much as possible. Leave the rest until the wound heals and the bone returns to its normal position.</start_of_turn
If the wound is soft, put on the poultices that we mentioned and the healing will be rapid in the chest and between the shoulders.</start_of_turn
If a wound from a sword or knife has blood covering it and air escapes from it when air is blown into the wound, know that it is a severe wound. If there is no blood covering the wound and the wound is direct, do not make any initial holes or sutures and do not tighten it, lest blood be trapped within the wound.
Do not leave the wound open to the air but cover it with a dry dressing and change the dressing every other day. If no dressing is available, make a small opening in the wound and let out the discharge. Keep the wound covered until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
The condition of the wound does not change, even if it has been three days or more, if there is no swelling, pain, discharge or difficulty in breathing. If you see that all of these signs are absent, know that the wound has healed effectively and that all treatment can be discontinued until it is completely healed.</start_of_turn>
If you are unable to see the wound and the limb is swollen and painful, know that it has become necrotic and that the discharge from the wound will not improve. If a wound on the chest or back has progressed without any stitches, know that it is still effective and that there is no need to suture it.</start_of_turn>
If the wound is large or has bone fragments, if it has caused fractures, open the wound and remove the fragments if they are movable. If they are fixed, leave them in place until they are naturally dislodged.</start_of_turn>
The wound should be cleaned and any discharge should be removed easily. As for all recent wounds in all organs, judge their treatment based on the general principles mentioned above.</start_of_turn>
Fifth and eighth chapters.
In the surgery of the abdomen and the extraction of the intestines and their stitching.
The condition which necessitates the opening of the abdomen may be great or small, and the large one may expel an intestine or several intestines, making the insertion and stitching more difficult and painful.
The small incision also sometimes causes pain from another side, and it is necessary to take great care that the intestine does not slip from its place while being inflated and tense. Therefore, the middle incision is better because it does not cause the slipping of the intestine as do the other two
And know that the stitching of the abdomen is on four faces, two general and two special which are used in the stitching of the abdomen and in the stitching of all other operations except for the stitching of the veins.
I shall explain each one of them individually with an elaboration and an explanation, and I say that if the wound is small and any part of the intestine has protruded and its return is painful, this necessitates the use of two faces of the incision either to reduce the size of the wound as we mentioned previously or because the intestine has been blown up by air beforehand.
And if so, it is necessary to moisten it with oil or wet it with cold water or put it in boiling water for an hour or two until the air has escaped.
Or it may be done with a laxative drink which is better than water alone in expelling the air, and if you see that the air has escaped, do not pull out the intestine with water, but rather put a piece of sponge or cotton wool in it and pull it out gently with ease.
If it still does not return after this treatment, make a small incision in the wound slightly with the instrument which we use for tying knots and the first treatment is better than the incision, and though it may be necessary to make the incision later on if there is no other way, and this is the form of the instrument:.
The lesion will be limited in its extent, while the other will be unlimited. The opposite side is not taut but is slightly floppy, resembling a small intestine. If the wound is dilated and the bowel enters, its reaction will be in accordance with its natural form.
Its position is significant if possible. If the hernia is large and located in the lower abdomen, it will require elevation on its back and elevation of the legs above the head. If it is located in the upper abdomen, the head and chest will be elevated above the lower parts.</start_of_turn>
Similarly, if the hernia is on one side of the abdomen, make the incision and dressing always on the side where the surgery is higher than the other side. This is necessary for large and medium surgeries.</start_of_turn>
As for the small surgeries, place it as you are able, then call a helper who will grasp the hernia with both hands and gather its edges before uncovering it from the surgeon.
This is a general characteristic of stitching that you take a needle or several needles of the size of the wound, and leave from the side of the hernia as much as the thickness of the skin. You then pierce a needle without putting any thread in its eye.</start_of_turn> With the fatty tissue under the skin from inside until it comes out from that side. Gather the skin folds and the fat folds together and make four layers. Then tie a silk thread around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound are joined together.</start_of_turn>
Then leave a space of the thickness of fingers also and pierce another needle and tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Do not stop doing this until you have evacuated all of the bowel from the wound and the needles are of medium size between the thickness and the softness.</start_of_turn>
The needle must not be too coarse, lest it tear the flesh and fat. It must also not be too fine, lest it be difficult to penetrate the skin.
So that neither the flesh nor fat is torn by its swiftness, nor the wound opened before its closure, and so that it does not recede from the suture, for the wound will otherwise fail to unite properly. Then break off the extremities of the needle, lest they cause discomfort when lying down and leave behind fragments of cotton from every side where the needle’s extremities were grasped.
Leave it until the wound has healed. This is the kind of suture most suitable for small incisions, as it may suffice with a single or two needles or thereabouts.
Or, in general, the suture should include the hair follicles around the edges of the skin and the fatty tissue in one pass with a needle that has a moderate thickness suitable for grasping tissue and bone
It should extend from the top of the wound so that the suture is similar to the large knots that people know.
In this way, the surgeon would suture the hernia which had occurred due to a wound in the intestines and which had extended beyond the skin, and which had protruded from the navel towards two finger-widths from the middle of the abdomen.
He left it out until the wound had healed for about twenty-four hours, and the wound healed within about fifteen days. He treated him until he was cured and he lived for many years afterwards, and the physicians judged that the wound had healed perfectly
Strange is the patient who I did not treat for his ailment because I was in a place where there were no medicines. So I put on the abdominal wound a plaster several times a day and washed it with chamomile water until it healed.

It is to be closed as those skilled physicians do, uniting each portion with its counterpart, regarding the problem in its natural position, by joining the margin of the sac to its margin and the margin of the loop to its margin.
The needle should be inserted through the margin of the loop close to you from outside and passed inside it once, then draw the margin of the sac and then pass the needle back out and pass it through from outside to inside through the margin of the sac on both sides, and then draw it back again.
It should be passed from inside to outside through the margin of the loop on the opposite side which is the reciprocal, this kind of stitching is better than the common easy stitching which is the straight stitch, as Galen mentioned, and some of them say that the stitching of the abdomen should be done with two needles And thus one thread is sufficient. Begin by inserting the needle from where you are and pass it to the other side. Insert the other needle from the opposite side and pass it through you according to the stitching of the sacs, whether it is fine or coarse stitching
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, its stitching is more difficult than that of other parts of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its management is like that of all wounds, for if you have detected the wound early while the blood is still fresh, before it has dried and contracted, and have firmly bound it, it will bear the burden of the aftereffects.
If the wound has been filled with air, it will bear some of the aftereffects which you have prepared until it softens and relaxes the sac and the loop, and then treat it like any other wound until it heals
If no medicine is available, carry it from the beginning of the procedure until the fluid discharge becomes thick and black. As I have taught you, this will suffice in most cases unless the wound involves major organs, in which case relief may be expected.
If you will cover the area with wool soaked in lukewarm oil or ghee and place it over the wound between the muscle layers, and if you feel pain or tension in the abdomen, do not fear, for this is not a cause for concern.
And if the swelling has gone down into the belly and the wound has burst into its cavity, and you know that nothing solid has passed through it, this is easier to cure than when something solid has passed through it.
As for the stomach which is known as the spleen, it does not tolerate surgery from the flank because of its many blood vessels and bones, its hardness, and its proximity to the nerves, and if something has burst from the wound, you must deal with it according to the reaction of the stomach itself, whether it is a bruise or an opening
If it has passed some time and become black, you must secure it with a suture above the black area so as not to expose bleeding, and if there is blood in the vessel and artery, cut only what is above the suture and tie off the rest
...and make the two ends of the suture extend outside the wound so that you can easily grasp and remove them when the bleeding has ceased and the wound has healed, mentioning the wound which is seen in the stomach, for if there is a fracture in the stomach and it is small, it is easier to close it
...and sometimes a person may appear before you who has pierced his abdomen with a knife and the wound is to the right of the stomach, and the wound has become necrotic and pus has come out of it, causing him to have diarrhea and vomiting, making you think that the treatment is in vain. If the limb remains painful despite treatment, do not proceed further until the underlying cause has been identified. I have never seen a case where the underlying cause remained undiagnosed and the condition improved simply by treating the symptoms. He truly eats and drinks, walks and sleeps soundly, and attends to his duties. Some experienced people have mentioned that whenever there is an opening in the intestines and the wound is small, one should take heed of this quality.</start_of_turn>
He takes large doses of opium, then sutures the wound edges together, and places one of the needles through the open mouth of the wound. If he grasps it and tightens the mouth, the head will snap off and it will not recover. He then places another needle close to the first.</start_of_turn>
Do not persist with this after having administered three doses of opium and covered the wound. Then tighten the stitches and close the wound. If these heads remain clasped in the intestine until the intestine itself is digested and recovers, there will be no further adverse effects of the wound. The intestine can also be sutured with fine thread.</start_of_turn>
Whoever comes from Egypt with a living animal that has not been rendered unconscious by the needle, take a portion of this thread from Egypt and let go of it yes, then tie it at its end with a fine thread that is unraveled, and then pass that thread through the needle.</start_of_turn> And with regard to the Egyptian thread, when you have sutured the intestine with it and returned to the abdomen, this blow of stitching, the opium, and the Egyptian thread – these are all on the way to recovery and hope.</start_of_turn>
If the defect is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the large intestines, there is no remedy or method for its repair except for the best treatment of the wound.</start_of_turn>
Sixth and Eighth Chapters
On the Treatment of Fractures and Dislocations.
I know that every wound or swelling which endures, accumulates pus and forms a cavity. And if it has not been treated, it will always extend in proportion as long as the swelling persists. This is what is known as a fracture in any limb which has been displaced and is called a dislocation
In reality it is a fracture of white solid bone which does not join together with it, and has a space like the space between the bristles of a brush
And it is called by some people a splinter. And sometimes it is soft and extends the swelling always, and sometimes the moisture is cut off in some cases and sometimes it is much, and sometimes little, and sometimes thick, and sometimes thin.
And it has been mentioned by surgeons that no wound heals without pus coming out of it, except for nine reasons, one of which is a lack of blood in the body, another is hardness, and another because there is solid bone in the middle of it which prevents the healing of fat meat Or because of excessive swelling and pus, or because the wound itself is infected, or because the dressing is unsuitable for the wound, or because the medicine is not suitable for the treatment, or because of decay in the wound from its origin.
Or because of excessive swelling and pus, or because the wound itself is infected, or because the dressing is unsuitable for the wound, or because the medicine is not suitable for the treatment, or because of decay in the wound from its origin. As it is mentioned in the city of Seville, where there is abundance of disease and retardation of tumors by nature, and because of great abundance of bone and marrow, and because of many bones, all these causes and their marks and treatments are mentioned in the division
And it is worth noting that I have mentioned the treatment of dislocations and fractures which is done by hand, know that dislocations can occur in all parts of the body, as in the bones of the limbs, or in the joints or in the nerves
The abdominal cavity, the chest cavity, the pelvic cavity, the flanks of the ribs, the lumbar vertebrae or the joints of the central articulation are often composed of many tissues like the hand and foot and among them is what is better for the main organ and its vicinity.
Whatever of these parts possesses this quality is from chronic diseases that do not yield to treatment and are associated with the face of adversity, while what is not among these parts but reaches these places mentioned earlier and is curable is recommended and praised for its treatment.
I would like to know the sign of this disease so that I may take a measure if the lesion lies straight and needs to be opened with a knife, or if it is in a place that requires a fine needle because the body is softened by it
When entering, it is soft towards the contusion, but if the lesion is extensive you cannot reach it with the needle because of its abundance, so take away some of its abundance with the needle which will leave a remainder, and the moisture which is in it will flow towards the other parts and will descend
Therefore, the exploration should be completed on any face that you are able to reach in order to know if there is a bone or nerve, or if the lesion is far or close, or if it is solid or liquid with many bubbles and if you stop at all of that with the amount of your skill and your little knowledge and there is pain when you press your hand on the place.
This is one of the signs and causes of the swelling, so if you stop at all of that and confirm the truth, faintness will be an indication of treatment and confidence is that you will see if it is or not
The lesion appears close to the joint or in a safe place far from the articulation, joint or vessel or vein or any of the mentioned places so open the lesion according to the progression of the description and remove whatever is soft and fatty or putrid and fleshy.
If there is flesh or boils in the mouth, treat them until they are cured. If the patient is far from the anus and is lying straight, make an incision in the depth that you are able and then drain all the bad flesh.
Then apply a ligature of silk or gut to the medicine at the tip of the anus which is protruded by the iron, do this several times until that medicine has eaten up all that remains in the cavity of the anus from the pus
Then keep the patients who have had the flesh properly excised until they are healed. If they are not healed do not delay any longer, but perform what is required of you as I have described, even if it is dangerous.
If there is a bone or nerve or main part as we mentioned, if there is some pus or filth in it uncover it until the pus has gone and then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed. If it is not healed and the pus persists as before.
Do not think that you have reached the end of the removal of the pus so leave all that is upon it once more and cut away the flesh and evacuate it with all your might and then keep it under observation, if it is healed and the pus is gone then you are done. If it is not healed and the pus persists as before
Cut away the flesh and evacuate it with all your might. The bone was large or small and you could grasp it with the forceps so take hold of it with the ligature that suits you best.
If there are many bones, cut them all away and do not leave anything behind. Your efforts will be in vain if you leave any of the ligaments without cutting them. Even if they are difficult to cut, do not be afraid of them for there is no danger in cutting them.
If you are unable to extract the bone at the desired time, carry the wound without delay and leave it until the surrounding tissue, ligaments and bones have softened. Preserve the wound and do not touch the incision you have made during the process.
If you fear that the process will cause you to bleed, apply a wet compress soaked in powdered plaster of Paris with oil or a moistened compress of Egyptian balsam or any other ointment, for these will facilitate the extraction of the bone and its surrounding structures
If a large bone such as the tibia or femur is fractured and only the head is protruding, wrap the wound tightly with a bandage until the swelling and decay subside, then expose the fracture. If the fracture involves a major portion of the bone and decay has advanced, do not attempt to expose the bone directly.
Isolate the affected area until the decay has subsided, as this will facilitate healing. I have mentioned in the leg of a man a similar case that occurred a year ago, and it was successful in his treatment
About three days have passed since the condition appeared in his leg due to an internal cause that caused great pain and swelling, without any external cause. It gradually subsided with the treatment of the doctors until the swelling was reduced
A lot of material and pus was discharged during his treatment, and many physicians were involved for two years. There was no skilled surgeon among them.
Until recently, I did not see any improvement in his leg, and the discharge of material and pus was severe. The patient's body grew pale, and his complexion became yellow. I inserted the trocar into one of the holes and extracted all of the material
Some bones in the foot are prone to fracture, and when this happens, they split open and expose some of the bones. This may cause swelling, pain, and tenderness, eventually leading to discharge from the wound.
The fractured bone may swell and split open, exposing the bones. This swelling may cause pain and tenderness, eventually leading to discharge from the wound. The fractured bone can be reduced and held in place with sutures or other medical devices until it heals.
The bone fracture is continuous and the wound has exposed the bone. This swelling has also revealed the fracture itself. The edges have been approximated without tension and the wound is left open to prevent further damage.
The edges have been approximated without tension and the wound has been closed. The dressing has been applied and the fracture is expected to heal quickly. There is no need for repeated procedures in this case, as it has been observed to be effective in other instances where excessive vomiting and diarrhea were present, resulting in complete healing.
The fracture is stable and the limb is now able to bear weight without causing pain. The patient's general condition has improved and there has been no recurrence of the fracture in other cases of similar injury
The fracture appears to be stable. A suture should be placed at the fracture site and held in position by an assistant. A second suture should be placed using a thicker material.
The surrounding tissue should be sutured, with the distal end of the suture held in place. The tissue should be stripped away from the fracture site before placing the suture. A block or plate should be placed under the bone from below to prevent further damage
If you perform the incision too deeply, the chisel will not grasp the fractured bone fragments. Therefore, the incision should be made slightly above the site of fracture to avoid damaging the bone beneath the surface without causing any visible displacement.
If the bone is fractured and not displaced, but some parts are connected by the fracture, you should expose the tissue all around then insert the chisel from below and fracture it from the first point where the fracture is located.
If you neglect to fracture from the other side after performing the incision and the incision is made far from the fracture site, the fracture will remain in the articulation of the fractured bone itself and will not be visible from the outside.
If the fracture is between two articulations and there is no other method, if the fracture is in the forearm or leg, it is sufficient to uncover the fracture as it appears and remove the displacement.
And by any means you manage to straighten it up when there is no nerve or vessel in the way, and know that the sectioning of these bones is many according to their position and stability and flexibility and size and angle and connection. Therefore, you must adapt each type of work to its like.
You must know that work itself may teach you the type of instrument you need if you are well-versed in the art and have seen many diseases from close experience. For indeed, you can learn from your own experience what is suitable for each disease, and in the final part of this book we discuss many instruments.
Make them examples that measure each other and compare them to others, as for example, the chisel:
From the tip of the knife to its handle.
From the tip of the small knife to its end
From the tip of the large knife to its hilt
The wound is like a nail head on which the mark of the incision is like the inscription of the scalpel, and it may reach the heads of the joints if they are lax or wide and great, or small as the last small one.
The wound is wide
It makes its arch above and its buttress from iron and its handle from a thick rod, so that the wound does not tear open
The last knife is fine
The last knife is deflected at the end
The last knife is like a nail
The final small incision
It is like a splinter of wood that is flexible in many places of the limb, so that the wound does not break the bone
The shape of the wound resembles nails of various sizes made of iron or copper, and so on, as we have mentioned concerning the wounds and incisions in general, so that it is like this in its entirety
Seventh and eighth chapters
On the pieces of limbs and the expansion of the bones.
The limbs may swell either from outside or inside. If this is treated with medication and the swelling does not subside, and if the swelling progresses to the organ, nothing will remedy it
It is better to amputate that limb where decay has spread, for it is better than death or great suffering. This is an indication of the extent of the infection.
Or it should be drained after the swelling has subsided, until that discharge reaches the tip of the limb. Then it should be amputated, for the same applies to any cause of decay, such as abscess of the sea-creature, or worms or scrofula, and the like.
If the infection or swelling is in a finger, it is sufficient to amputate the finger, and if it is in the hand, it is sufficient to amputate from the wrist, for neither will facilitate the spread of infection
Or if the infection has reached the elbow, it is sufficient to amputate from the elbow joint itself, for if the infection and swelling are taken towards the shoulder, the shoulder will not be saved even if the elbow were amputated.
The same applies to the leg, if the infection is in the toes, it is sufficient to amputate the toes at one of the joints, and if it is in the thigh, it is sufficient to amputate the thigh including the hip, and if it is in the calf, it is sufficient to amputate the leg at the knee joint
If the infection has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to leave it and allow the patient to die, or to amputate the limb above the knee or below the hip, by tying a ligature below the part to be amputated and above the part to be retained
The surgeon ties one ligature below and another above the part to be amputated, and the fat between the ligatures is stripped away until the bone is completely exposed. Then the limb is amputated or drained, and the surrounding tissues should be sutured from all sides with a strong thread.
If the sharp instrument is placed accurately in the area of minimal pain and swelling, and if bleeding occurs during the procedure, quickly withdraw the instrument or clip off some of the blood vessels and then continue the treatment until bleeding ceases.
The injured part should be firmly bound with a bandage and the treatment should be continued until healing occurs. I will tell you about an example of a similar case in which bleeding occurred in a leg with swelling and heat resembling fire.
That was the first time such an infection occurred in his limb until a man took all his limbs because he did not see the infection spreading in the limb except for the pain and swelling only, which were at the joint and healed him.</start_of_turn>
And so, when some time passed, he noticed the infection in his hand again and abandoned it, forming aversion to that treatment which carried medicine on his hand after cleaning his body, for it did not cause the infection to subside and the pain continued to spread in his other limb.</start_of_turn>
Until he finally amputated his hand, believing that this would cure the infection, and indeed he had hope that it would, but he also feared death because of the strength of his limb, and so he abandoned the city.</start_of_turn>
I heard that he only amputated his hand and healed, and I tell you this story as an example to illustrate the nature of this disease and as a guide for dealing with it.</start_of_turn>

If the patient's throat is narrow and cannot accommodate the injection tube, other methods of administration must be considered, such as mixing the medicine with water or an emulsion or administering it through other medications or substances known to have similar properties.
The throat is often too narrow to admit the injection tube. In such cases, the medicine may be mixed with a thickener or administered with other substances until it has expanded. If the mouth is also wide, the lips may be stitched together and left open only enough to admit the injection without further expansion
The saliva that flows from the mouth upwards to the root of the tongue often rises too high and prevents the substance being injected from reaching the lower parts because the saliva in the root of the tongue hinders the flow downwards
If you cannot open the throat towards the lower part as much as you wish, so that the organ can be easily reached without any obstruction, the patient should be instructed to salivate freely as much as possible
As for the medications that are placed on the throat from outside, their method of application is that you take one of the aforementioned medications and spread it over the surface of the tonsils. Then, with the forceps, make an incision on the side of the throat wider than the throat itself and spread the soft tissues outwards, then apply the medications mentioned above to the opening and leave them in place without touching the large opening, except for the area where the injection tube has been placed
There are several days, and as for the one on the throat, it is the one that removes what is in it at every moment so that you know what comes out of it, whether it is a lot or a little, thick or thin.
If the hidden abscess persists despite treatment, assess the surrounding area for any pain, swelling, or palpable masses. If there is no improvement with treatment, the material being expelled will likely pass easily through the orifice of the abscess.
If the abscess has not resolved or its attachment is weak, it may be resolved in a day or two. When the wound has healed, change the dressing and apply new ointment. If the abscess has not discharged after a long time, do not be afraid of excessive drainage.</start_of_turn>
The abscess is close to bursting because some people slow the healing of meat in their surgery and among them is that which prevents it, for if the abscess discharges after many days, it will discharge pus without damage, know that the abscess has not burst and that the slowing of the discharge of the abscess is not from its bursting.</start_of_turn>
Continue with the administration of medications and maintain the moistness of the ointment as it is, like the balsam. If there is an excess of ointment, it is better to reduce its amount rather than to increase the frequency of application.</start_of_turn>
The broth should be boiled and poured over the bandage, and it should be allowed to cool before applying. It can be used like this if you do not have honey, or if you have used it and it has dried out. Take some of the broth and be patient and diligent in washing away all impurities, and leave only the honey.</start_of_turn> Then cover the discharge with a plaster and bind it to the abscess or apply honey which has been boiled until it thickens, and leave it on the abscess. Put some ointment on it and bind it.</start_of_turn>
You can also use long wormwood, chamomile, asparagus root, henna and rue separately or in combination. Use whatever you like and leave it on the honey which has been described and use it.</start_of_turn
The condition may affect the bones or solid nerves or active ligaments, thereby facilitating treatment of the ailment as it progresses.
Chapter IX and X.
In the treatment of scrofula and fistula, the disease is reduced and interrupted by cutting the abscesses and draining them.
Scrofula is a collection of pus that forms under the skin of the elbow or knee, and sometimes in other parts of the body. If left untreated, it becomes swollen and painful
Or it becomes solidified and painful, until it consumes the whole limb and sometimes extends to the bone, producing a foul odor and making the limb limp and pale, and if you do not treat it as we have mentioned in the previous section, the treatment will be in vain
It is necessary to excise by knife all the abscesses which have formed under the skin, and then to dress the wound afterwards. This is very useful, and if the bone is sound and the abscesses are also sound
and if the limb was previously swollen, it should be put under a bandage of lead and the limb should be elevated above the level of the heart, and all the surrounding fat should be excised with the abscesses.
And ointment of corrosive medicine should be applied to what remains of the flesh, until all of it has gone away, and then it should be treated with medicines until it is healed. And if the bone has been affected by the infection, it is necessary to excise that bone and evacuate it if it does not heal.
If you see that the swelling and infection are progressing in the limb, remove the affected part of the limb from one of the joints as mentioned above, and treat it until it is healed. And if the abscess is large or severe and there is pain and swelling, it is necessary to amputate the limb immediately.
If the wound is gaping, insert a foreign body of a breadth equal to the thickness of the wound and deflect it from above downwards. This will prevent it from reaching the underlying tissue. If the underlying tissue is still exposed, address the cause of the wound and tighten the edges.
As for the swelling which sometimes arises in the limbs of people, sometimes it is due to fat, sometimes to bone, and sometimes to a wound. The swelling of some of them is at the root of some joints of the fingers.</start_of_turn>
Or it may be due to some swelling of the joints of the fingers which do not move and which are fixed at the root of the finger, perhaps because it has been fractured.</start_of_turn>
And as for the swelling which is at the root of the joint, its treatment is to cut away the bone and split the bone open at that point. Then the bone is spread open according to that.</start_of_turn>
Then the wound must be closed, and as for the swelling which is seen in some of the fingers, this is what is seen in the swelling of a burn or wound. And this is what causes harm to man.
Until the fingers return to their natural shape, and then insert between them a splinter or fracture of a soft substance smeared with oil, so that it does not adhere readily and separate between them or cause them to adhere to each other, or to leave a layer of lead foil between them until the wound has healed.</start_of_turn>
And so if the swelling of some of the fingers is seen in the palm of the hand, split the swelling open according to what is appropriate and restore the limb to its natural shape.</start_of_turn
Chapter Nine.
In the section on wounds
Wounds are blood vessels that have been torn open and contain blood, and are commonly found in the limbs and, most frequently, in the veins of the forearm, elbow, and thigh. Therefore, one must immediately apply pressure with a dark dressing to stop the bleeding.
Then remove the source of the bleeding and as for treatment, there are two methods: one is to ligate and remove the black blood, and the other is to apply pressure with a bandage until the bleeding stops. If the bleeding does not stop, it is necessary to elevate the limb in hot water or cold water, according to the situation
Until the black blood has clotted, then elevate the limb from above the knee downwards and clamp the limb from below the knee to above the knee with a bandage, and then make an incision in one or two or three places wide enough to let out the pus
Then drain the black blood from below the knee to above the knee and from above the knee to below the knee until it comes out of the wound enough or until the limb is strong enough to withstand the pressure of the black dressing. Then close the wound and bandage it well, and abstain from eating and drink the black dressing until it is healed
When the veins are full and this causes pain in the limb, and as for the discharge, it is like this: if there is much hair in the limb, pluck it out before putting on the hot water and immerse the limb in hot water until it becomes soft and pus comes out or until there is a strong movement.
If it has not been softened by the application of the hot water, then make an incision along the vein either above or below the knee, and open the skin with forceps and evacuate the pus from all sides until sensation returns.
When the wound is closed, if the hair remains, it appears red like blood. If it is pulled out from the skin, it also appears like a vein. Then, the needle passes under the hair follicle until it reaches the depth of three fingernails. The needle then emerges from the skin leaving the hair follicle intact. A second incision is made alongside the first incision to the length of three fingernails.
Then the skin is released from the neck until it is visible. The edges are then secured with sutures as before and closed with another suture or multiple sutures if necessary.</start_of_turn>
Then the sutures are passed through the end of the incision at the armpit and pulled out through the second incision. The sutures are then passed through the tissue above the first incision and repeated until the tissue is secured from the third incision including all the previous incisions.
If there is no bleeding, insert a strong needle with a knot and tie it off. Pass the needle under the tissue and grasp it with your hand to pull it out to all sides until it emerges and protects it from cutting. If there is bleeding, this indicates a severe injury and the wound should be closed immediately.</start_of_turn>
A swab of lint is inserted into the wound. If the bleeding stops, cover the surgical site with a moist pad of wool and oil or butter and dress it until the bleeding stops. If the bleeding persists, it is associated with a severe injury and requires immediate closure.</start_of_turn>
If the situation is not stable as we mentioned previously, a suture should be placed at each area of tension and the wound should be closed with sutures until all the sutures are in place. The bleeding should be prevented by the suture technique, and if there is bleeding, the effort should be continued without causing additional damage.</start_of_turn>
The secret of healing wounds.
The profound secret of healing wounds.
It has no explanation like the other treatments, and its tip is not severe lest it tear the fluid and become thick and viscous because if it is too thin, it will not adhere to the wound and if it is too thick, it will be of no benefit as we have mentioned before.
The moderate degree and expansion of the wound
In the middle of the fluid there is a measure of dilution
This fluid is found in the veins in hot countries such as Iraq and Arabia, and in the dry regions of Syria and perhaps in other parts of the body except the veins, and it is caused by the infection that exists under the skin
Likewise, it occurs in living bodies and decaying matters, in abscesses and boils, and the fluid that is secreted between the skin and the flesh, and the sign that this fluid has originated is that it appears in the limb when there is severe swelling, then gradually subsides, and then the fluid begins to emerge from that swelling.
It is as if it is the origin of a plant or an animal, and if a part of it appears, it must be covered with a small piece of lead that is equal in weight to a barleycorn and is bound and left with the lead covering the wound
Whatever comes out of it, whether a little or a lot, must be covered with lead and bound, and if it is left for a long time, some of it will break away and cover the surrounding area with blood and infection and worsen the wound
So it is necessary to manage it and be sparing until it comes out completely, and there should not be anything remaining of it in the body. Sometimes this fluid comes out in people who have not eaten for five days or ten days.
If a man has come out of ten with an injury, and you cut into him while treating him, and insert a probe into the wound and surrounding area with great care, until all the matter and medication have been evacuated, and you attempt to close the wound again.
Then deal with the wound according to the treatment of tumors, as it may contain many fragments of bone, especially if it is in the knee or the arm, for it will cause many wounds and discharge from every orifice.
Chapter Two: Expansion.
The section on the swelling under the joint is called the bovine swelling.
This disease is called in some countries the bovine swelling because it is often seen in cattle and is a small worm that is between the skin and the flesh and spreads throughout the body, causing swelling and pain
It appears when its worms are expelled from one organ to another until they come out through the skin in a place other than the wound and cause swelling in the abdomen, veins and arteries
And when they spread in the body and reach the head and reach the eye, it may cause the eye to swell and become detached from its socket, which often happens, so if you want to treat it and remove it, that must be done while the worms are still inside and the swelling is present.
So one should bind what is above and below with strong thread, then make an incision and remove it. If it is swallowed and is not found, carry on the procedure until it is burned out, and do not leave any sign of the worm remaining.
If it has gone up to the head near the eye, grasp under the eyebrow with strong thread and make an incision and remove it. And it is necessary to take care of the wound and administer medications that facilitate the elimination of worms and maintain a diet that prevents infection.
The Third Section and Expansion.
In the third section and expansion. Regarding the swelling known as nafar.
Nafar is a swelling that is prevalent in our land and is known to spread from one organ to another, and I have seen it on various occasions
A woman was brought to me with swelling in various parts of her body. I found swelling in her arm and a large tumor that spread in the armpit. It was as if a worm was ascending from her armpit towards her shoulder as quickly as possible, like the plague or a scorpion bite
When it spreads from place to place, it still causes pain in the place where it started and becomes fixed in the armpit, then sat for an hour and saw that it had spread throughout the body until it reached the other arm. Then I recounted that the entire body was rotating around what I had seen
So I was astonished at the speed of its spread from one organ to another, and I had never seen anything like it before except for the people of this land who describe this condition as nafar.
I could not help but think that this must be due to the woman's lowly social status and her constant exposure to the elements, for such a phenomenon is not to be seen in the affluent and well-protected populations of our time
If you wish to treat her and ease her pain, it appears in the eye as I mentioned previously, and it grows more intense and urgent, like an uprising or a fierce beast that must be subdued
And if you do not see it with your own eyes, it will not vanish from the body by mere words or the blowing of a magical wind or the application of unguents or fragrant balms.
The Chapter on Injuries to the Trunk and Swelling.
In the Excision of Arrows.
Arrows may differ according to their types and the locations in the body where they are lodged. As for their difference according to their types, there are those that are large and small, and among them are glass splinters and solid glass, and those that have three angles and four angles.
Some of them have barbs and others do not. As for those that are located in organs, they are on two surfaces, or they are major organs like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, and bladder When an arrow penetrates one of these organs and signs of death appear, which I will describe to you later, you must avoid extracting that arrow. Death will follow the owner in most cases When these signs of death do not appear and the arrow has not penetrated deeply into the organ, extract it and treat the wound. As for the brain, if an arrow is lodged there and has perforated the bone and the abdomen, this will cause severe headache, dizziness, and vomiting.
When these signs of death do not appear and the arrow has not penetrated deeply into the organ, extract it and treat the wound. As for the brain, if an arrow is lodged there and has perforated the bone and the abdomen, this will cause severe headache, dizziness, and vomiting. And there may be swelling in the eyes and swelling of the tongue, convulsions, loss of consciousness, vomiting, bleeding from the nose or ears, and loss of speech and hearing, and discharge from the wound resembling bile, and it proceeds like blood from meat
If these signs appear, refrain from treating lightly and do not extract the arrow if it has not already been removed. As for the wound if it is close to the left side of the chest and you suspect that the arrow has penetrated something solid rather than air.
If the wound resembles the pulsation of the artery and black blood flows from it, then know that death is inevitable. If blood resembling butter escapes from the lung wound, this is a sign of death.
The veins near the neck swell, the face turns pale, breathing becomes rapid and shallow, and the chest muscles tighten. The patient requires cold air, for if the wound is close to the ribs breathing becomes laborious and painful.
All bodily functions cease, and the wound bleeds profusely, dark blood resembling liver tissue escapes from the wound. If the wound is near the spleen, breathing becomes labored and painful, and vomiting occurs from the food eaten earlier.
The patient is in shock, and if the wound is in the abdomen or has produced vomiting and feces from the wound, there is no hope of recovery or the removal of the arrow
The patient vomits and pain intensifies on the face, indicating imminent death. All organs of the head, neck, chest, abdomen, and limbs are affected, except for the heart and large blood vessels
When the arrow does not strike a vein or bone and is not venomous, and if I inform you of the signs I have witnessed concerning these arrows, it will aid you in your treatment, for often an arrow that has entered the body near the nose lodges in the armpit.
I have extracted it from the ear and the armpit without causing any injury, and another arrow which was hidden under the lower eyelid, the tip of which was embedded in the ribcage, without causing harm to the surrounding area
Three large arrows were discharged from the central bow, each with an iron tip. None of them had an arrowhead, and the Jew did not suffer any harm from them. Another three arrows were discharged from the neck bow and one of them was an Arabic arrow.

Another three arrows were discharged from the neck bow and one of them was an Arabic arrow. The one with two arrowheads split it among the abdominal masses and it penetrated deeply into the ring, so that it was forced out. The neck bow discharged another three arrows, one of which was in the groin and the patient was believed to be dead from it.</start_of_turn>

Another three arrows were discharged from the neck bow and one of them was an Arabic arrow. The patient had an arrow in his groin and was believed to be dead from it. The patient also had an arrow in his face and another in the middle of his nose, slightly to the right. The swelling from the arrows was small and he complained of only slight pain under the right armpit.</start_of_turn
If the arrow has not emerged and the wound shows no sign of it, it implies that the arrow has become lodged without penetrating the tissue.
The wound has remained closed despite repeated applications of pressure, and no accident has occurred. It is therefore inferred that the arrow has not fully penetrated the tissue.
Until it was opened and the tip of the arrow was pulled out, it was suspected that the arrow had become lodged without penetrating the tissue.
When the wound was finally opened and the arrow's tip was extracted, it was discovered that the arrow had become trapped without actually penetrating the tissue
The physicians observed that the bone of the nose did not buckle under the pressure of the wound closure and the wound healed without any lasting damage, despite the fact that some arrows had to be removed as evidence of their presence
Given the complexity of these crafts and the limitations of our knowledge, it is not possible to describe or explain them in writing. The true understanding can only be gained through direct experience and practical observation of the skillful craftsman
When one departs from this craft, we say that the arrows emerge from the tissues in two ways: either by the attraction of the wound itself where it entered, or by the pressure exerted by the surrounding tissue against the wound itself
If the arrow is deeply embedded in fatty tissue, it may attract and hold, and emerge. If you are not forced to withdraw it at the time of injury, you must leave it in place until the surrounding fat has softened, facilitating its extraction.
If you are not forced to withdraw it, leave the arrow in place also for any days, and move and grasp it every day until it emerges. If you are not forced to withdraw it after any days, you must encircle the arrow around the bone from every side with soft material until the arrow expands and can be easily grasped and removed.</start_of_turn>
If the arrow has penetrated the skull and damaged one of the brain cavities, and some of these symptoms appear, grasp the arrow and leave it in place until the condition improves after some days.</start_of_turn>
Be cautious in grasping and extracting the arrow, if it is deeply embedded and you are not forced to remove it, use a clamp around the arrow as described previously and treat the area until the pain subsides. He neglected the sensation of the limb and grasped the arrow with forceps. If you feel pain, grasp the arrow with some instruments suitable for grasping, and if you are unable to grasp it due to the narrowness of the wound and the protrusion of the arrow, do not break the bone or nerves or blood vessels.</start_of_turn>
He abandoned it until the wound expanded and the arrow could be easily grasped. If there are fat layers that are holding it, separate them from all sides with any means possible.</start_of_turn
If you attempt to remove an arrow from any location, use all your strength and grip the wound tightly until it is evacuated. Otherwise, if you do not manage to grasp the arrow firmly, it will be difficult for you to extract it.
Grip the surrounding tissues tightly until the wound contracts, then attempt to grasp the arrow firmly. If bleeding occurs, use the methods described previously in this chapter to control it. Conserve your strength and avoid cutting nerves, veins or arteries.
Use all your skill and composure to remove the arrow without causing further injury. Keep the wound stable and firm as you grasp the arrow firmly. Be cautious and mindful of surrounding structures, as any damage could complicate the situation.
If you are unable to remove the arrow, use whatever is available to stabilize the wound. If the arrow has passed through and emerged from the opposite side, or if you see a fragment of the arrowhead protruding from the skin, grasp it firmly near the tip.
If the bone is fractured, grasp the wound tightly around the circumference and use all your strength to pull the arrow out.
If the arrow has pierced the bone, grasp the wound tightly around the circumference and pull the arrow out using all your strength. If the bone has fractured, insert a hook into the hole created by the arrow and pull it out using the hook
If the arrow is lodged deeply, remove the surrounding tissue until the tip of the arrow is exposed. If the wound is infected, remove all infected tissue if possible. Leave the wound open to drain until it heals naturally.</start_of_turn>
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, rib cage or flank and is close to what might be obstructed by the bowel, you may make an incision there and preserve the surrounding tissue and nerves, and then remove the arrow.
Then make the incision if necessary, and then close it when finished, so that the arrow is expelled without causing further harm to the surrounding tissues.
The extremities of the wound will be like the plumage of a bird that has grasped the arrow or anything else that has not escaped, and different sizes will be made according to the size of the arrow, the width of the wound and its depth
Image caption: Diagram showing the different sizes of incisions for an arrow wound depending on the size of the arrow, width and depth of the wound
Image caption: Close-up image of an arrow wound with surrounding tissue preserved
This is the tip of the arrow, which is like a plummet, and it will not cause difficulty in removing the arrow itself.
The incision is fine and wide enough.</start_of_turn>
In the vein/artery.</start_of_turn>
The veins which are usually found in the body are three in number: one in the head, sixteen in the neck, and two behind the ears known as the temporal veins, and two in the armpits known as the axillary veins.</start_of_turn>
The brachial vein runs through the middle of the forehead and the facial vein is in the cheek and the temporal veins are in the neck, and the axillary veins are in the armpits. These veins are known as the facial veins and the subclavian veins.</start_of_turn
Concerning the veins that flow in the arm and hand, there are five of them. One of them is the cephalic vein, which is on the outer side and is named the general vein of the head and arms. The second is the brachial vein, which is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins and is named the general vein of the body.
The basilic vein is located on the inner side and is also called the axillary vein. It is named the general vein of the abdomen and the arm.
There are three veins in the leg and foot. One of them is the popliteal vein, which is on the outer side. The second is the saphenous vein, which is located at the ankle. The third is the dorsal venous arch, which is on the inner side.
There are three veins in the other leg as well. As for the veins behind the ears, they are useful for the long-standing swelling of the testicles, the groin, and the head of the femur, and for the swelling of the buttocks.
The head of the ulna (elbow) and the back of the neck are placed over the two veins running behind the ear. Then the ulna is pulled backwards over the thumb until the veins appear below the thumb. There is action in the thread when the thumb is grasped.
The beak of the scissors is grasped and the vein is grasped with the thumb. The vein is then passed under the skin to the bone, and the limb is lifted up with the skin and the vein cut off with the tip of the scissors. The length of the cut is equal to two thumbs together
If blood needs to be drawn, let the patient drink a quantity that suffices, then tighten the ligatures and leave them until it has clotted. This matter was discussed in the first book concerning these two matters. As for the two arteries in the flanks, their benefit is in the chronic flank pain, severe headache, permanent swelling, and acute pain that extends to the eyes.
Their benefit is in what I have described, which is that it tightens the skin over the flank with a vein until sweat appears between the fingers and the pulse is perceptible under the fingers. When that is learned, then the skin is elevated from above the sweat to the height of the knuckles, which causes the vein to dilate.</start_of_turn>
The vein is entered from below and elevated to above the sweat, and its blood is drained as much as you require. Then the ligature is tightened around the vein and the finger is placed on the sweat an hour later.</start_of_turn>
Then a compress is placed over it and pressure is applied and tightened from above and left until it has clotted. This matter was discussed in the first book concerning these two matters. As for the vein of the forehead, its benefit is after the excision of the wisdom tooth due to the chronic face pain, fistula and abscess.</start_of_turn>
Its benefit is in what I have described, which is that it tightens the skin over the flank with a vein until sweat appears. Then the instrument that is called the forceps is taken and this is its form.</start_of_turn>
The bony spicule that is at the head of the forceps is placed on the same vein and it is struck from above with a stick or something else in this manner. The blood is allowed to flow to the desired extent and then the ligature is tightened until it has clotted.</start_of_turn>
If a fracture is close to a joint, do not make the incision too deep. Make it shallow and precise, as the bone is nearby and any excessive depth may damage it.

The veins in the vicinity of the wound should be ligated securely so as not to cause the underlying cause of the wound to remain. As for the blood vessels that supply the tip of the tongue, they are of benefit in the excision of the tonsils, for they benefit the corners of the mouth, the inflammation of the tongue, the ulceration of the lips and the soreness of the gums.
The veins around the nose and the surrounding area should be secured so as to prevent the underlying cause of the wound from remaining. As for the blood vessels supplying the tip of the tongue, they are beneficial in the excision of the tonsils, as they supply the corners of the mouth, the inflammation of the tongue, the ulceration of the lips, and the soreness of the gums.
The veins around them should be ligated securely so as to prevent them from bleeding excessively. If one should bleed despite this, it is possible to tie off the bleeding vessels further down.
As for the veins under the tongue, they are beneficial in the excision of the wisdom teeth that are in the jaw from the disease of the tonsils and the ailments of the mouth, and the benefit of their excision is that the wound remains closed between the hands and the tongue is raised and one vein is seen from the one side and the other vein from the other side and both of them are ligated black

Or a broad ligature with olive oil or a needle and suture as follows: tie a knot [like this] with the broad ligature of the olive oil.
The vein is wide as you see, to facilitate the opening of blocked veins filled with blood clot that protrudes outwards, which contains thick blood like a cluster of dates, and this is the picture of severe olive oil deficiency.
This is severe olive oil deficiency
This is severe olive oil deficiency, which may cause various symptoms depending on the degree of the vein narrowing and obstruction
This vein is wide as you see, to facilitate the opening of blocked veins filled with blood clot that protrudes outwards, which contains thick blood like a cluster of dates, and this is the picture of severe olive oil deficiency
...and it is recommended to avoid the area of the clot with sutures and redirect the flow of blood to other areas.
...or to clamp the vein and leave it for a while before tightening the suture to find the exact location of the clot before proceeding
...then tighten the suture while leaving a space between the clot and the suture site, and if you feel the vein expanding when tightening the suture, this means that the suture is too tight and you should loosen it
...if you see blood leaking at the incision or if the blood is dark red and thick, this means that the vein has been injured and some blood vessels around the clot have been cut, which can cause further bleeding when the suture is tightened.
Leave it be, and take care of the main thing. Leave it on the neck and do not move it until it heals. If blood is not cut and it does not swell up, and no medicine has been applied to it, then cut the artery if there is swelling and its two ends are contracting and cutting blood.
Or take a sliver of alum and split it in half. Take one half and bind it to the place of the neck tightly with a bandage. Leave it for a day. If blood is not cut and it is not effective in what is being mentioned concerning the cutting of the arteries, then cutting it is not difficult in most cases.</start_of_turn>
It is not necessary for a small wound to be tied up in the arm. As for the neck, it is useful because it can draw blood from above the head and below the body to the place where it is made up of branches of the brachial artery and branches of the carotid artery as we have mentioned.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary for it to be on the neck from its belly. If the vein is tense and there is increased tension in the suture and the nerve is affected, there will be pain that will impede the eye and perhaps not heal at all. This nerve is often affected.</start_of_turn>
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and does not show, it is necessary to make a deep incision and avoid the nerve. If the neck is between two arteries, split the artery of the neck.
It is useful in certain eye diseases. And it is necessary in this particular neck case; either by fine sutures of olive oil or by broad sutures of the type called "Ray". Because it calms all the arteries.</start_of_turn>
If the incision does not yield the desired result on the first attempt, do not confine yourself to the head of the limb alone. Request the surrounding area as well. It is not harmful if it has not been struck by the initial incision; it may be useful later on.
But it does not harm the swelling in any way. As for the method of incision and its results, it is not appropriate to advance in repairing it except as a last resort.
It is permissible to use it in diseases only, and that which is used in preserving health and maintaining it, and guarding against the occurrence of diseases, should be the incision of one of the three veins which are in the groin, the armpit and the buttock, and the incision should be in the first spring if there is an indication of filling.
The incision is on the seventh or eighth day after the morning has passed, and as for the incision which is used in diseases, it has no specific time limit, but when necessity or urgency demands it, it may be performed at night or day
At every hour and at every time, and never should the boy be incised until he has reached the age of fourteen, and the old man who has passed the age of sixty should not be incised, for if anyone is forced to perform the incision for any reason, it is for him.
The abdomen must be evacuated before the incision by means of a catheter if there is much thick mucus, lest it be drawn into the veins during the incision of the abdomen and cause infection of the principal organs, and do not perform the incision on the fatty tissue or the skin or the bone until that which is under it has vanished
Do not perform the incision immediately after eating or drinking or during menstruation or fever or sexual exertion or fatigue or travel or fasting or any other strong physical or mental exertion, then look at the color of the patient's complexion before that if the blood is dark.
With food and drink if possible, then enter the bath if there is no obstacle or perform some exercise to raise the pulse and cause the blood to flow throughout the body as we mentioned. We hope that he will empty his chest of all psychological and physical anxieties by evening.

Then sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion on which you are sitting, and then extend your arms and grasp the chest with your hand several times or three times. Then tighten the ligament with the index finger and thumb several times or three times, but not too tightly.
For the tension should not be excessive, for either too tight a tension prevents the circulation of blood, or too loose a tension hinders it also. After tension has been applied, the hand should grasp all parts of the chest with both hands together with some pressure.
Until the veins expand and sensitivity returns, then the surgeon should wipe away any blood from the area with a soft towel. Then he should place his little finger of his left hand on the same vein under the point where he wishes to make the incision, slightly below the level of the wound so that the vein does not slip from under the cut For the vein is neither as taut as a bowstring nor as limp as an untied thread. When it is placed under pressure, the blood within it becomes relaxed and the cut will not slip from under the incision. If it is opened too wide, the vein will be damaged.
The wound must be closed and the edges must be properly aligned for all of this. Then the needle must be passed through and the vein opened from its previous location or in the vicinity under that place slightly above or below it immediately if the position has not already been altered.
If the swelling or displacement is great, leave it for a day or two and do not tie down the wound. It may bring about a burning fluid which does not enter the bath. If it returns, make a small opening and if the needle is thin and the blood flow is rapid.</start_of_turn>
It is forbidden that blood should flow out in any quantity. Repeat the needle in the same place and bring it close to the alignment and slightly widen the opening. Do this immediately, for in many people the position changes when the small opening is made.</start_of_turn>
If the patient has swelling, do not tighten the dressing. This will not help and may actually impede healing. Place some lint or absorbent material on the wound and leave it open. This will facilitate blood flow, which is better in this location than oil or any other dressing.</start_of_turn>
Use lint or absorbent material for all wounds and veins when blood flow is difficult. This may be achieved with the application of digitalis or rhubarb if placed on the area. Otherwise, the blood will stagnate and decompose.</start_of_turn>
If in the area of the wound a large swelling occurs, do not open it further. This is especially true if the opening has not already been made or if the vein is small. In such a case, apply to the swelling a soft sponge moistened with water and salt and bind it tightly for an hour. This will cause it to soften.</start_of_turn>
The wound must be closed and the edges must be properly aligned for all of this. Then the needle must be passed through and the vein opened from its previous location or in the vicinity under that place slightly above or below it immediately if the position has not already been altered.
If there is swelling or a tumor in the rectum, and it is detected by the finger, it should be grasped and squeezed. If it softens under pressure, it is a tumor; otherwise, it is swelling.
If there is bleeding from a vein, but it is contained by the surrounding tissues, it should be grasped firmly to stabilize the area before attempting any other treatment. All people should evacuate blood in proportion to their strength and the color of the blood should be noted.
If the blood is black, it should be evacuated until it turns brown. If the vomit is thick, it should be sent for examination. If it is severe, it should be treated immediately. Strong people should evacuate blood readily without hesitation
The wound should be widened and the area around it should be relaxed. The weak should avoid straining themselves during the process. It is better to use a blunt needle than a sharp needle in the process of drainage
This beating of the bowels is safe from bleeding and cutting nerves. It is good from the wide opening and the long duration. If it is done with a blunt needle, it is safer than with a sharp needle. If the patient is full of pus during drainage, it should be fed something from barley flour or buttermilk before drainage
If he vomits blood three or four times or if his complexion is pale, he should be given something before drainage from barley flour or buttermilk, or from honey or from dates or from vinegar.
If there is much bleeding during drainage, it is necessary to save blood and give the patient barley water or vinegar and to apply pressure to the wound. All of the medications mentioned in the chapter of wounds should be used.
Whoever has excessive sneezing and whose limbs yearn to rest and whose blood needs to be refreshed, it is behooves him who has a weak stomach and excessive sneezing that his blood be refreshed sparingly and gradually rather than abundantly in any successive days.
Whoever desires to refresh his limbs and rest his blood again, and who has a strong body, should do so gradually over seven or eight hours from the first part of the day. As for him who wishes to draw blood from his body to apply it to the parts that have become cold, it is better that he do so on the second or third day.
Whoever has much blood in his body due to excessive sneezing and weakness, and who is feverish, it is better for him to draw blood all at once in a large quantity and widen the opening so that the wound will heal after all conditions are met Place your hand on his pulse when bleeding to prevent death from the wound, as this is much more dangerous if the surgeon is inexperienced and negligent. It is not necessary if you wish to stop the bleeding and refresh the blood again.
When the saliva duct is closed and bleeding continues, do not tighten excessively or force the blood out. It is better to leave it until it stops by itself or remove the clot with a fine suture.
Put some salt dissolved in water or something of the above-mentioned things on it and cover the wound with a wet dressing until the blood comes out. If the saliva has clotted, leave it alone.</start_of_turn>
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If urgent, it is permissible to draw blood from the other arm or from the vein in the neck.
If a vein in the arm is severed, it is severed in place of the cubital and brachial veins if they are not visible or are hidden because they are composed of both of them. The method of severance is to insert the needle into the water until it becomes warm and the lymph appears on the surface, then to tie it above with a few loose and moderate knots.
If lymph appears on the surface, the vein is severed slightly below the elbow but not too far or wide. The incision should be high enough to reach the wrist without causing excessive bleeding. If bleeding persists, withdraw the limb from the water and allow the blood to drain into it.</start_of_turn>
Until your need is fulfilled, if you are in the summer, you may omit the limb from the water. The blood will flow more readily in the water during the winter, and the secretion of lymph will be safer from all veins.</start_of_turn> Because there is neither thick lymph nor nerve, and as for the vein of the right hand, its severance is useful from the causes of the spleen and the method of severance is to tie the wrist with the bandage or by hand after it has been plunged into the warm water until the lymph appears.</start_of_turn>
Because there is neither thick lymph nor nerve, and as for the vein of the right hand, its severance is useful from the causes of the spleen and the method of severance is to tie the wrist with the bandage or by hand after it has been plunged into the warm water until the lymph appears.</start_of_turn> Then he will tie the sensation again and sever the vein slightly below the elbow if necessary, though even if he severs it throughout it does not harm anything and preserves the hand if the nerve of the fingers and the place are known from the fat, then he will withdraw the hand from the warm water again.</start_of_turn>
And he leaves it to flow in the water if you do not need it in the warm water, the blood will freeze in the lymph and obstruct the flow. If you remove it from the blood after this, put on the lymph some fat and salt so that it does not dry out too quickly.</start_of_turn>
It is also necessary to perform every tight suture carefully, and as for the benefit of the palm of the left hand, it is useful for the liver as well as for the rest. As for the deep suture, its benefit is for the diseases of the lower abdomen such as the diseases of the intestines.
The retention of the testicle and kidney stones and prolonged diseases of the thigh, leg, and bladder are among the diseases which necessitate surgical intervention. The effectiveness of the suture lies in its ability to withstand immersion in hot water and carry the load until the vessels have healed and then to be secured above the knee joint with silk thread and a knot placed at the cubital fossa toward the thumb.
The greatest part of the disease is in the face of men; so if you open it wide at the cubital fossa or at the knee when it is joined, this is better and safer than if you open it in the face. For if you open the face of a man, you will expose the nerves which are beneath the skin of the face.
Make the suture as if you wish to cut and it will be weak. If blood does not come out, leave the limb in the hot water and allow the blood to flow in it until it drains out. If you make a mistake in the initial incision of the vein with the needle, do not be afraid to reopen it at the first opportunity
Leave the suture until a little beyond the skin; for if the area is sound, it will not be painful to her. This is also the way to do with the saphenous vein of the leg or the other limb. As for the vein of the woman, its place is as we have mentioned at the cubital fossa.
The benefit of its suture is for the hip if it is done before the hot water and the effectiveness of its suture is that it can enter the yellow bile and become rapid and tighten the limb from the groin to above the knee with four fingers in a long and thin bundle, and it does not appear except in this way.
If the wound appears, grasp it in any convenient position, or turn it, as that is better, or cut it with a knife if necessary, but take care that the surrounding area is intact. In most people, the vein is hidden deeply and is not easily found.
If the pulse does not appear, grasp some of its hair, as that which appears on the back of the foot towards the ankle, and it protects the nerves and sends blood in the quantity required.
Then tighten the ligature and position the incision precisely, for it will soon heal
Sixth and seventh incisions.
In the joints and the way they are used
The bones may be of horn, wood, ivory, or glass, and the incision is on two surfaces, one for draining blood and the other for excision without draining.
And this incision which does not drain is on two surfaces.
And the veins of the neck are two, all of which are under the chin, the veins of the armpits are two, one on each side of the breastbone, the veins of the arms are two, one under each armpit, the veins of the thighs are two, and the veins of the calves are two.
And the incision should not cause the fainting of the patient or the weakening of the strength, for the incision is for draining blood only, and it is not permissible to use the incision with fire in any disease until all of the body is evacuated of its contents.
If need be dictates surgery for a patient or by custom, we employ it at all times in the first month, in the last month, in the middle month, and at any time.
And thus it is that some people, when there is much blood in their bodies, require surgery, for in their heads they feel a lump and headache, and among them are those who feel swelling and redness in their face and head and neck, and among them are those who feel sharp objects in their face and jaw, and swelling and pus in their eyes, and among them are those who have pain in their joints and muscles.
Among them are those who are prone to laughter, and among them are those who find blood in their mouths and vomit blood, and among them are those who have bad breath and belch blood, and among them are those who sleep excessively and among them are those who see blood and pus in their sleep and swelling and boils and wounds like these, whenever we see any of these things.
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we perform surgery after two or three hours have passed. As for the benefit of incision, it benefits the weight in the head and water that runs into the eyes.
But it is necessary that this be after the patient has vomited all over his body. This surgery may be instead of trephination and we must beware of employing it in one who is pale or delirious, as it may harm him greatly.
And thus it is not permissible to use it among the learned or in cases of cold fevers. From the most severe to the mildest, forgetfulness is its greatest companion.
And it is necessary to command the surgeons to lower their hands slightly with the needle to avoid causing fainting, and as for the incision of the callous, it is instead of trephination and flaying of the bladder.
The excess of wind, tight chest and breathing difficulties, and vomiting and diarrhea are all harmful. It is therefore advisable to raise the head of the patient slightly as this will alleviate the tension on the heart and stomach.
As for the vomiting of black bile, it is beneficial in cases of headaches, leg pain, shoulder pain, and dental pain, instead of the purging of black bile which is harmful. It is advisable to instruct the attendants not to put their hands too deep into the patient's condition, as this may sever a vessel and cause bleeding
The vomiting of black bile is beneficial in cases of toothache, gum swelling and decay, and possibly for ailments of the gums, which is better than the purging of black bile which is harmful. As for the vomiting of bile from the liver, it is beneficial for the spasms of the jaw and the heat of the stomach and chest.
The vomiting of bile from the liver is beneficial because it draws blood from all the small veins in the body and sends it to the large veins, which ultimately reach the three major veins.
It is advisable to instruct the attendants not to touch the patient's condition as this area is delicate and involves nerves and blood vessels. The single evacuation that should be performed is that of the phlegm from the rectum and the lower abdominal cavity.
It is advisable to instruct the attendants to perform a large and gentle evacuation as the area is in need of great force. The bladder may break and the patient's condition may worsen considerably. As for the hip bone, it is recommended to avoid excessive pressure
Because it draws blood from all parts of the body and is beneficial for the chronic pain in the kidneys, abdomen and bladder, and the swelling of the spleen and tumors. It replaces the fainting of the veins and the swelling of the veins caused by infection or injury
The technique of placing sutures is as follows: one should first tie an empty knot and then pass the needle through the tissue steadily without tension. Do not leave the sutures in place for too long, but remove them quickly to accept the tissue properly upright without tension. Repeat this process until the tissue has regained its normal colour and opened up.
The colour of blood will show when the tissue is taut and the sutures are properly placed. Look at the patient's condition, for if the tissue has a thick layer of fat or is fatty, one should tie only one suture and not more, lest the tissue should tear
The surgeon is to expand the condition slightly and deepen it a little, and to alter the tissue slightly, for if there is blood clot in the vessel, two sutures should be used, or one should open the vessel and remove the clot, and if only one suture is used, the clot should be grasped and pulled out
If the blood is viscous, it is necessary to repeat the procedure three times to reach the desired height. In general, if we wish to remove only a little blood, one suture will suffice. However, if we wish to remove a lot of blood, more sutures are necessary, or we must grasp the blood clot and pull it out directly.
The suture should be placed deeply and with moderate tension only on the skin surface. Do not use too much pressure when placing the sutures or too little. If the patient has thick, tough, fatty tissue, do not use too many sutures, as this may cause the tissue to tear.
The sutures should be secured with loose, open stitches filled with absorbent material. If it is summer, beeswax or almond oil or olive oil or castor oil can be used.
If it is winter, like Narcissus fat or fennel seed or hyssop seed or chamomile and similar, and if the wound is large and cold, use butter of alum or chamomile butter or poppy butter or almond butter or beeswax and similar.
If the wound is large and the surrounding tissue is fatty, it is necessary to smear butter and other fats, and it is recommended to wash the surrounding tissues after cutting with rose water or cold water or water of fennel or chamomile or vinegar or alum water, and so on for the moist ones
Wash the surrounding tissues with vinegar or alum and dates or chamomile or fennel or poppy seed and so on. And if the wound is large, be cautious of cutting in the bath or after the bath.
Do not use anything for at least an hour or two after the bath, and no one should sleep after the cutting. The wound should be covered and protected before and after cutting.
If the wound is yellow or purulent, and is mostly caused by bile and inflammation, it is necessary to take refrigerants such as rhubarb and chamomile and fennel and aloes and gum and so on, and make the patient eat barley and lamb fat and fish and dates and honey and so on
If the patient is cold, give them honey and vinegar or barley gruel and fragrant wine, which is between the old and the new. It stimulates digestion and makes the food more digestible. The drink should be more abundant than the food during cutting and after cutting.
In certain cases, it may be necessary for certain individuals to abstain from eating pork, opium-based medications, or alcohol before, during, or after surgery to enhance the functioning of major organs, promote blood circulation, and prevent complications.
As for the procedures that impose no restrictions, they are those concerning the liver, spleen, chest, abdomen, kidneys, and hip bone because these organs cannot tolerate any restrictions. The objective is either to draw blood from one organ to another.
We use the artery in the armpit for the purpose of bleeding or for the injection of cold substances to dilate the organ as we do with the artery in the abdomen and the groin. This dilates the organ, contracts it, and expels the pain.
It is possible to place a catheter on the kidney if there is an obstruction or stone in the kidney. This will either expel the obstruction or dislodge the stone from its position. The same principle applies to procedures performed on the liver and spleen when air is injected to dilate them
A needle or an inflated balloon may be used during the procedure in the chest or abdomen to expand the cavity and facilitate the work of the surgeon.
Then a catheter is placed over the area and secured, and it is repeated as needed. This is the method that employs the needle
Its lumen is two fingers wide and extends to the midpoint of the chest. In its neighborhood there is a small perforation made by the needle which is made of Chinese or German steel, and it has a thick coating of gut or leather
A smooth, spherical balloon catheter is placed to prevent injury to the organ when it is placed on it. In the middle there is an obstruction made of steel, where the candle is placed. The size of the catheter is increased or decreased according to the ailment
The instruments are fine, but the wounds of boys and girls are different from those of men and animals. As for how to apply the cautery to the organ, it is to make a small incision from a strong piece of gut or a small piece of fat and place it in the middle of the attached piece.
The flame should be raised towards the upper part of the wound without burning the body, and then placed on the organ and the fingers on the hole mentioned previously until the wound is closed.
And the vapor will come out through that hole and the wound will be closed on the support, and then a suture is made over the area and taken out if necessary. As for the cautery which is used in the disease of fistula by water, there is no attached piece or hole in it.</start_of_turn>
It is only used on the organ itself and is placed on it directly.</start_of_turn>
And as for this cautery, when it is large it is best for holding much water.</start_of_turn>
The Seventh Section and Expansion.</start_of_turn>
On the Larynx.</start_of_turn>
The cautery is used in most cases in organs where it is not possible to place the instruments either because they are large or small as the skin and lips, or because the organ is covered with fat like the fingers and nose and etc.</start_of_turn
And its method of use is to cut from the vein which is in clear water from the fat, and leave it for a day or two in the water until it becomes soft and there is nothing remaining in its cavity.</start_of_turn Then it is evacuated first by incision or by suction, and then the organ is washed.</start_of_turn
Until the blood has clotted, then place your finger on it. If the vein has been obstructed, and you are able to restore the flow by manipulation, it is better in benefit than if you wash the area with vinegar and water. And if the blood flow persists after the obstruction has gone, this is a favorable sign that the clot has come out through the opening in the vein into the cold water.
And place it over until the flow stops. If there is much blood in the clot, mix it with powdered charcoal or sponges or other similar substances until the blood stops or put on the area half-soaked sponges.
Leave it until the vein is healed in the area. If the blood stops, it is good. If you wish to remove the clot, do not attempt to do so if there is another way. If the clot comes away naturally, wash the area with warm blood.</start_of_turn>
Or pierce the area with a needle until something comes out of the blood vessel. Then place your finger over it if you feel anything of the blood clotting on the surface. If you wish to remove it, and something comes out with it, mix with a little patience or salt or lime juice, and it will come out on the surface.</start_of_turn>
The End.
In Surgery.
This chapter deals with fractures and dislocations of bones in general surgery.</start_of_turn>
You should know that many ignorant people consider themselves doctors and common people, and that those who have not studied this book or read a letter from it.
Knowledge of this kind has become rare in our land and anyone who does not have profound knowledge of surgery should not attempt to practice it.</start_of_turn> When one has diligently studied the initial chapters and applied himself diligently to understanding them, then one has grasped the science from it. He must then continue to practice and experiment throughout his life.
I have set forth in this chapter all that pertains to the science of it And I have continued to practice it after I had made it accessible to you, having abandoned the long-drawn-out method and adopted the concise and clear method, explaining it in a way that elucidates the subject and presenting numerous images of the instruments that are used in it
For indeed, more is gained by explanation as I have done in the preceding chapters, and God is the ultimate source of power
Chapter One
Here are some general statements and definitions concerning fractures and dislocations that will precede the discussion of the affected organs and structures in this chapter. You must first understand it and grasp its essence, for you and anyone else who is serious about learning this noble science
I say that whenever there is a fracture or dislocation of bone, skin, nerve or any other part of the body, it is essential to expedite treatment or alleviate the pain or both at the same time These things do not prevent it, such as weakness of the power or whatever befalls him, young or old, whether the time is severe or cold is intense
Then his diet is limited to cold legumes, poultry and vegetables, and he should abstain from alcohol, fatty foods and strong foods.
If the fracture is displaced from its original position, it must be reduced before any other treatment is applied. If the fractured bone is grasped in the forceps, the wound must be nourished with soft and nourishing food such as barley, wheat, lentils, dates, raisins, almonds, and buttermilk. If soft and nourishing food such as barley, wheat, lentils, dates, raisins, almonds, and buttermilk is given, the consolidation of the fracture will be faster and more comfortable, and I know that a fractured bone that is in the joints or bones of old people will not unite and heal in its first position ever
Their joints will unite and their bones will heal, just as the bones of young boys unite and heal. But the nature of the fracture will cause it to unite from all sides, something that resembles glue that holds and strengthens it until some of it needs to be cut away
and some of it must be cut away until it reaches its full strength and stability as it was originally, without anything hindering its action.
Therefore, it is necessary that the patient's food be soft, nourishing, and thick as we have mentioned, because the fracture may be of different types depending on the organ affected, as the fracture of a leg bone is different from that of a head bone or a shoulder bone.
and so all of these organs are different from one another, and we will mention each type of fracture in its appropriate section without comparing them to one another. The type of bone fracture may also differ from one another.
Because it may be a small fracture without splinters, or it may be a fracture along the bone, and the fracture may have splinters and protrusions, and the fracture may be with skin tear and bleeding, and the fracture may be a compound fracture with displacement.
Every type of surgical technique has its own special characteristic in the bone where it will be performed, and what characterizes it is that it causes displacement of the bone fragments and produces tension and exposure of the nerves and blood vessels.
When there is neither displacement of the fragments outwards nor tension or exposure of the nerves and blood vessels in the bone at the site of the technique, and there is neither great displacement nor any palpable fracture, then it is possible that the fracture is stable and needs no reduction or that it is a hairline fracture or a small fracture that does not require movement or pressure from the forceps.
Indeed, one should administer the medications mentioned later, and apply them cautiously and with gradual tightening, and know that the bone will unite by itself without any displacement of the fragments, except in the case where there is displacement that has not been mentioned previously.
You must be cautious and delay the tightening process until the swelling subsides, for if there is swelling during the process it will be impossible to complete the technique.
You must know that closing and stitching are easier than uniting the bone which has fractured, so tighten whatever is mentioned later, for if the bone is fractured, it is necessary to support both sides of the fracture from the front and the back.
Either with your hands if the fragment is small, or with sutures, or with both sutures and hands, and keep the fractured fragment in a stable position over its natural position until such time as the fractured parts reunite, when the fragments must be placed back in their places with all the care and gentleness possible
Be cautious in your movement and do not cause additional displacement, and keep the fractured fragments together as much as possible without causing further pain or swelling. If you see anything out of place, correct it and stabilize it to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive force and strong grasps, as many fools and ignorant people often do and thereby cause harm.
Then ensure calmness after stabilization and composure, and that the limb is at rest and tranquility, and take heed that it should not be moved when awake or asleep, or during its change of position, or upon defecation. Its utmost extent should be its natural range of motion and should be completely painless with the support of the limb itself.</start_of_turn>
Therefore, if you sense pain or discomfort when supporting the limb, transfer it to another support which causes no pain and allows its freedom of movement.
For indeed, if any deformation occurs in the limb due to excessive force, and as you have comprehended, the larger the limb, the greater its toughness and sensitivity.
Therefore, the ligature should be tight enough to support the large limb without causing constriction or discomfort.
Then, after you have finished with stabilization, bear the weight in accordance with that. In the case of a fracture, bind the limb in its place first, then begin wrapping the bandage around the fracture itself three or four times as appropriate. Tighten your hand slightly with each wrap and then move it to the upper part of the fracture area.</start_of_turn>
Wrap less tightly around the fractured area and gradually loosen the tension while maintaining support, until you achieve a comfortable position, then apply another support and wrap it around the fractured area as well.</start_of_turn>
The dressing is then applied to the lower part of the fracture and should be firmly secured as described previously. A layer of dressing material is placed between the fracture and the surrounding tissue or the skin covering the fracture.
If there are angulations, do not leave anything inside; then apply another dressing and bandage securely over the previous dressing.
If there is swelling or heat, put on something soothing and let it remain for some time. Then tighten the bandage securely when the swelling has subsided and the fracture is stable
When making it from silk or date palm fibers or wool or flax, do this and make it snug in this way.
The dressing which is placed on the fracture itself should be somewhat less thick and wide than the other dressings, and as for the length of the dressing it should be made according to the size of the fracture and the surrounding area, so that the dressing does not hinder movement.
Then tighten on the bandage another bandage as described previously and secure from above with strong sutures as we mentioned previously, that it should be more tightly secured at the site of the fracture And whatever is beyond the fracture is less tight
And the sutures should be of medium thickness and flexibility and should be from strong materials because if the sutures are thick and rough like what is done by the ignorant, they will cause the sutures to become open and this is a great mistake
Because it is outside the norm and the fine sutures are also not appropriate because they do not reach the desired level of tension, and it should not be less than the fingers between the dressing and the fracture.
If the wound becomes inflamed in the joints after tension in the proper places, make under it some barrier of wool or lint until it does not irritate from that. As for if there is a fracture with a wound and a break in the skin, consider it separately.
Know that not every fractured limb should be tensioned with sutures from the first day. For if the limb is large, do not place sutures upon it until five or seven days or more, according to your concern for the swelling
And this is the characteristic of the early bandages which were used for fractures and dislocations, a general salve that is short and which strengthens the fracture and is of great benefit, especially for children and women because it does not burden them with heat or cold.
And take from the soft wool of the sheep, which is the fine wool of the sheep that is adjacent to the navel when the flank is moved, for it is soft like that which is without hair and makes the wound not to stick to the dressing
Another characteristic of the dressing which strengthens the fracture and dislocation is to take from cotton wool, flaxseed, barley, anise, and gum from each of them a quantity equal to ten dirhams and mix and be patient from each of them five dirhams. From the white of the eye or Roman gum take ten dirhams. They all are pounded and mixed with cold water or yogurt if the patient is feverish, and this dressing is used, for it is good for healing and strengthens the fracture quickly and is beneficial for most people because of its gentleness.
Another characteristic of the dressing which also benefits the fracture and dislocation is to take gum, barley, flaxseed, white of egg and Roman chamomile from each of them a quantity equal to ten dirhams and mix and be patient from each of them five dirhams. Add barley starch six dirhams, white of an egg or Roman chamomile ten dirhams. Pound all of these together finely and mix with water or yogurt and use it
The description of the ointment for joints and bones is as follows: take a soft wool cloth and soak it in olive oil that has been boiled, then place it on the affected area. This ointment does not contain any force of pressure.
But it is useful in relieving swelling and pain specifically. Another ointment for fractured bones takes papyrus wool and poppy seed and linseed, and grind them together to make two pastes. This is another short ointment that is used when there is displacement of a fractured bone
And if you want to analyze the rest of the swelling, take from the root of the heel bone and the heel bone and the kneecap and the bone marrow from each one and mix them together and apply to it if it is not moving, but if it is moving, use mustard oil or water and use it.
Another ointment is stronger in analyzing this one and is used when there is swelling of the abdomen when there is displacement of the bone, take from the root of the heel bone and the heel bone and the kneecap and the bone marrow from each one and from almonds and cinnamon and poppy seed and sesame seed and barley flour from each one part.</start_of_turn>
They grind all of it and mix with water or vinegar or paint. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that it should be placed on the fractured bone when setting it.</start_of_turn>
The ointments made from fat and oil are not other than those described as being moderate between thickness and thinness. As for Galen, he thought that it should be placed on the fractured bone when setting it, things that contain cavities with some heat, such as resin and beeswax and honey, as we mentioned.</start_of_turn>
The properties of the remedy that benefits the weak and the pained are as follows: it takes musk, lime, and the scent of a human prostrated or the plume of a bird, along with saffron and salt of parts, whether they are pounded or whole.
The remedy takes musk, lime, the scent of a prostrated man or a bird's plume, saffron and salt of parts. When it is used, it should be observed that if it does not yield an effect after a number of days, there is no need to continue using it. A broken bone will not mend itself by prolonged use of the remedy.
It should be observed that if it does not yield an effect after a number of days, it is not necessary to continue using it. A broken bone will not mend itself with prolonged use of the remedy. Therefore, take a decoction of alum or sponge with moisture freely, soak them in cold water and apply them to the painful area until the pain subsides and the swelling diminishes. Then leave the limb at rest for an hour.
Then cover it with a soft cloth moistened with oil or ointment of rose and bind it firmly for a night until the swelling subsides and the pain ceases. Then remove the bandage gently and apply the remedy sparingly and easily without causing renewed pain
Until it is healed. If you see that the swelling, pain, and discomfort have subsided completely and all the symptoms have disappeared from the remedy and the tightening, repeat the remedy in the same way as before, even if nothing appears to have changed in the limb
Do not remove it except after three or four or five or seven days, and even then only if you see that the limb is healed as we have mentioned previously, for the bone may still be fractured and the tissue may still be inflamed.
The wound also swells more than the first time and increases in size, and the food of little value becomes more difficult to digest than before. If you notice that the position of the fracture has become softened and relaxed more than is desirable, know that the food is being obstructed from reaching it.
When it is washed with cold water every time it is bound, but let that be for three days only, as this will somewhat reduce the swelling. This action will bring about the evacuation of the food and quickly restore the appetite, as the fools who over-bind the fracture will again cause it to swell another time.</start_of_turn>
For if it has not been properly bound the first time and has been bound too tightly, this is a mistake in their practice and a great error. And though it may be right in theory as they have written in their books and done it, I have never seen anyone benefit from it.</start_of_turn> It is better not to do it at all.</start_of_turn>
The second section title is missing from the provided excerpt, so I cannot translate it.
The provided excerpt does not include the text for this section, so I am unable to translate it.
There are many kinds of head bone fractures and their shapes are diverse, and their causes are varied. Some fractures are caused by a blow from a sword, while others may break the entire bone right up to the dura mater which surrounds the brain ...as in wood.</start_of_turn
And thus it is called a compound fracture when some of the bone is broken and displaced from its place, and a fracture that breaks only the outer layer of the bone without breaking the inner layer is called a buckle fracture.</start_of_turn
From fractures, what is not of them is that they are caused by a blow with a stone or a fall on a stone or in some way. This fracture is either displaced and close to the membrane under the bone, or it is in the face of the bone.
These fractures are also either extensive or slight. And a fracture that is hidden in the bone under the hair is an abrasion that runs along the bone.
This is called a hair fracture. It is when a blow with a stone or a fall on a stone causes the bone to split without breaking through the skin.
There are splinters that are associated with these fractures, and some that are not. We will discuss the treatment of all of these fractures in their place, and we will describe all of these types of fractures when we examine them.
We remove the soft tissue from the fracture and open the bone. As for the hair fracture, it is recognized by the exposure of the bone and the blackening of the fractured area. As for the treatment of the fracture, we will consider the underlying cause of the fracture first.
If you see from his symptoms what indicates fear like vomiting, swelling and stiffness, loss of consciousness, groaning, muscle spasm, redness of the eyes and swelling, do not treat him. Death is likely in this case with these symptoms in most cases regardless of treatment
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you think he is safe, then delay treatment for a while. This is because if he has been injured in the winter, it is likely that he will recover on his own
You must exert yourself in removing the bone today on the fourteenth day of every month, especially if it is summer. Otherwise, if you delay until the seventh day, the membrane under the bone will become spoiled and cause the symptoms we have described.
If the fracture has reached the brain membrane and is associated with swelling and bruising, then you must cut away the swollen part of the disease and that which I have mentioned, which is to trim the protruding fragment of the fractured bone.
And uncover the bone from whichever side you are able to and as much as the nature of the wound and the swelling will allow. If you uncover the bone and there is bleeding or swelling, this is normal in such a case.
And fill the space with pounded sponges in broth, fat, gum, and plaster, and tie up the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then take hold of the fractured bone and remove it. This should be done on one side only of the work
Or one side only, as in cutting the bone with a slight groove at the edge of the wound.
Then use another saw after this cut, and expose a little less than before.
Then use several different saws, some wider and some narrower, and they should be of strong steel or iron of good quality.
And use the mallet to strike the cut so that it does not split the head of the bone. If the bone is strong and solid, you should support it around before using the saw which we call the non-piercing saw or the non-splitting saw
Since it does not exceed the limit of the proximal fragment of the tibia, the opening of the wound does not extend beyond that point so that the letter M of the [fistula] is directed toward what is below the fracture like a beak of a sparrow or a small ring that hinders its closure and extends beyond the thickness of the bone.
You must take from this [fistula] multiple incisions, each of which reaches the extent of the thickness of the bone until it brings together each fragment of the fractured bone, with the sharp end of each fragment directed toward the amount of thickness of the bone itself. This is three types in total. Large, medium, or small
As for the technique of the incision around the fractured bone, it is that you make the opening of the wound so that the fistula rests on the bone and you guide your fingers until you have learned that the bone has snapped, then you move the fistula to another location and make the surrounding area as thick as the surrounding tissue or somewhat more
Then you cut the intervening fragments between each two incisions and do so until you have achieved maximum traction as we have mentioned until the bone snaps either by hand or by some other instrument that you have prepared for this purpose
Like sponges and intestines that are wrapped around, and you must take great care that the fistula or the fragment does not touch anything from the peritoneum, for if you have united the bone and it has escaped from the peritoneum, if you pull it out with the fistula still attached to it, it will be necessary to remove it.
And smooth the roughness that remains in the bone with another instrument that is similar to the fragment, except that it should be thicker and softer than the other fragments. If there is any small fragment or splinter left, grasp it with your instruments along with the fistula itself.
The wound is treated thereafter by incision and the medications that are mentioned. As for the other half of the work, it is easy surgery far from the bones as Galenus has mentioned and praised greatly. You must first uncover the bony part of the fracture that is the most severe and well-known until you uncover that part which has become separated as a result of this fracture
The fractured part of it is firm and does not cut through anything, and the sharp part of it is on the lateral sides extending towards the length as you see. The fractured part is supported by the peritoneum and the sharp part of the fracture is against the bone. Then strike the fracture from one side.</start_of_turn>
With a small hammer until you cut through all the bones in contact and as it rotates. You are in safety from the membrane without causing any significant damage, even if the surgeon is unskilled and people are forced to agree even if they are cowardly.</start_of_turn>
If anything remains of the bone from the membrane in some parts of the bone, cover it with the fractured part itself and leave it with it. It will be separated from it without harm or fear.</start_of_turn
And as for if the bone fracture did not penetrate the membrane and remained with the fracture itself and there was swelling and splinters around the fracture, then you must remove those splinters and reduce that swelling within the surrounding tissue. You have taken various measures for this purpose and can use them as you see fit in each case and according to what your work requires.</start_of_turn
And the fractured bone and its shape, you must use for support in the first place and then use more refined instruments afterwards. Do not hesitate to do so until you reach the finest and most delicate instruments of all.</start_of_turn>
Concerning all minor fractures and soft tissue injuries, judgement should be exercised as to which remedy is most appropriate in each case. This is a matter of knowledge and experience within this profession, and accords with what has been written and explained previously regarding major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after displacement of the bone, two sutures should be taken on the extent of the wound and covered with fat and oil, and placed over the wound margin. Another suture should then be taken, similar or different in kind. It is covered with liquid, fat, and oil, and placed over the first suture. This is done with the least possible tension, so as not to compress the viscera, and is secured only to the extent of the wound itself
It is left like this for one or two days until the swelling subsides. Then it is removed and other medicines are used alongside, such as aloes, saffron, rhubarb, and myrrh.
It is left as it is until it dries and becomes scabbed. In general, medicine is used which is not painful and does not harm. The patient should be encouraged to move around during treatment, and the wound should be kept clean, without pus or blood clots
For if pus accumulates on the brain membrane, it will damage and weaken it. This will result in great suffering, and will expose the brain in the cranium, especially if treatment is delayed.
The swelling on the surface suggests that the ailments mentioned previously are severe and incurable. Know that death is inevitable in such cases, for the swelling is only increased by the medicine that is applied.
Take from the gut a portion and from the fat of the rose three portions and strike them hard together and mix them well with the urine until it becomes like vomit. Then place it on the abdomen and treat it with the various treatments that are necessary until it heals.
Part three.
In fracture of the nose, if it is displaced.
Know that the nose does not fracture except for the upper part of it, for the lower part of it is cartilaginous and does not fracture, but it shows injury through swelling and pain and discharge
If one of its parts fractures, then you must put the little fingers through a hole in the nose and straighten that fracture from within with the thumb and index finger from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape, but do this cautiously and with care lest you cause additional injury
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and has not reached the little finger, then soften it slightly with a soft substance. If the fracture is in the two parts, do the same, and do not do it immediately, but rather after a day or two of the fracture
If possible, and after seven or eight days when the swelling has subsided, then enter through the hole in the nose and insert a thread from the root of the nose if the fracture is in one part, or two threads if the fracture is in both parts.
The thread should be thick enough to fill the hole of the nose, and remember that some of the learned men advise that you should change the thread every day and do not see me doing that, but it is necessary to change the thread with urine, which is white and mixed with blood.
The bone must be stabilized and the cartilage must be firmed, and if there is a break in the nasal bones, the tube of the nose must be placed behind the bones after the break has been fractured, so as to hold the bones in their place and prevent them from separating further.
This is not essential; if you wish, you may make incisions and create fistulas, but take care not to widen the nose during the procedure, for this may loosen the nose from its cartilaginous framework or fracture the nasal bones further
If there is no swelling, it is necessary to support the nose externally with fine sponges and sutures, and do not suture the nose to anything, for if the nasal bones fracture again, they will break more easily
Or make an incision and remove the fractured piece, then suture the wound and apply appropriate medications, for if there is an injury inside the nose, make an incision and use a tube Until it heals.
The end.
The surgeons must be forced to break off their oaths
If the lower jaw breaks and is not fractured with injury, or if it is fractured only from the outside and not inside, and if the fracture is known, it is facilitated
If the fracture is on the right side, insert the thumb of the left hand into the mouth, and if the fracture is on the left side, insert the thumb of the right hand and raise it to the level of the fracture from inside to outside
The soft parts surrounding the bone control its movement. If a fracture of the jaw has been comminuted with two pieces, then two nails should be used on the incline until its stability is restored. If an irregularity has occurred in the teeth, elevation is recommended.
Or [you] can loosen what you wish of its tissue, that it may remain with a thread or silver or gut, then place it on the fractured bone and place over it a pledget of sponge and over that a drain, and over the drain a large closed dressing or a piece of skin that equals the length of the bone Then bandage from above as you deem necessary for its binding and support until it does not slip and the limb is relaxed and the food is soft, for if you suspect that something has changed in its shape from the face of the face, do not delay in treating it until the third day
Then bandage from above as you deem necessary for its binding and support until it does not slip and the limb is relaxed and the food is soft, for if you suspect that something has changed in its shape from the face of the face, do not delay in treating it until the third day Then complete what is contained in the wound with barley meal with eggshell or fine millet after you have removed the bone fragments and place over the wound a soft dressing, for as long as the dressing sticks to it and the bone has not changed its position, leave it alone
Do not remove it until it has healed and the fracture has become firm, for its width will grow for three months. If during that time swelling appears, repeat what was mentioned previously in its treatment until that swelling has disappeared.
And as for if there is a fracture with a wound, or if it has become loose from the bone fragments, remove only those fragments which are appropriate for the extraction from the instrument. If the wound is narrow, expand it as much as is necessary for your need.
Then if you have extracted those fragments and nothing remains of them, if the wound is wide, carry one of the bandages mentioned previously for its treatment. The wound must be closed until it heals completely.
The incision must be closed when the wound has healed
... until the swelling subsides
The swelling is often greater at the proximal end of the fracture than at the distal end. The fracture is most commonly on one of the three surfaces; if it is fractured and split into two without any splinters, this is easier for the surgeon
... or if the fracture is associated with a wound. The work in this case is more difficult if the fracture is uncomplicated, for it involves the dressing of the wound and reduction of the fracture. If the fracture is associated with a wound, the surgeon must be careful not to damage the nerves that supply sensation to the fractured limb and the surrounding area
... and then the fracture must be reduced until its shape is normal and there are no fragments remaining. If further tension is required, a bandage should be placed under the limb below the fracture or a piece of cotton wool
... so that the limb is in its normal position and the wound is closed. If further tension is required, the limb should be elevated and the fracture should be protected by a bandage until the fracture has healed completely
... and a moderate dose of medication is placed under the skin of the limb. The assistant grasps the limb from below until the fractured bone is elevated above the level of the wound. The surgeon then reduces the fracture and closes the wound with his fingers
... If you feel that a fragment of the bone has fractured and is moving, you should ligate it and remove it. If the fragment is embedded in the bone, it is necessary to amputate it at one of the points that has been prepared for this purpose After the belly becomes under the traction of the instrument which preserves the peritoneum, which is an instrument of wood or iron, in this form:.
After the abdomen becomes under the traction of the instrument which preserves the peritoneum, which is an instrument of wood or iron, in this fashion.
If the wound that you opened to extract the bone shard is large and has become inflamed, join the edges of the wound with sutures. If the fracture persists or the inflammation is severe, amputate the wound and remove the surrounding tissue to the extent of the wound's breadth.
If the fracture persists or the inflammation is severe, amputate the wound and remove the surrounding tissue to the extent of the wound's breadth. You place a bandage on it and place a ball under his armpit if necessary, then take a graft that is long enough to reach the breadth of the wound or somewhat more. Then you carry the surrounding tissue with the graft and suture it to the wound The width should be three fingers and as long as that. Then insert the graft into the hole and insert the hole with the graft into the area of the fracture and suture the layer over it as you would rotate it. And there should be a collar on his neck and under his right armpit and under his left armpit. Pass the suture over each side several times as you please, for you should know that the tightening should fix the fracture without tension.
And make sure that the graft does not slip from the fractured bone. And it is necessary to strengthen the dressing every day. When you relax the tension and see that the graft has slipped, correct that and tighten the suture. Then keep the patient resting on his back and place his armpit under the pillow at night.
To raise the limb from the side to raise the fracture of the scapula by raising the elbow or by tying the arm to the neck, do not break the suture if it has not happened by a wound or swelling to the extent of twelve days.
If you see swelling in that area, then apply the dressing. Leave it in place until it heals and becomes firm. It will strengthen and become more powerful in twenty-eight days.</start_of_turn> In some people, it may be less than that.</start_of_turn>

Seventh Chapter.
In the treatment of a fracture of the collarbone.
The collarbone may fracture in its middle and sometimes what is not apparent may cause more damage, and its branches are more likely to fracture and rupture. Symptoms include pain that leans towards the lower part and causes severe discomfort and anxiety, and swelling.
The swelling may be displaced in the fractured bone and sometimes does not cause pain, but it does cause discomfort, and the arm should be elevated on the chest and supported between the armpits with the elbow flexed and the wrists placed under the chest, and the hand should be clasped together and brought close to the chest
And when the shape of the bone has returned to its normal position, apply ointment and plaster and put a bandage over it from above with a sheet of soft material or rubber and bandage over that And bind it firmly to the fractured bone so that it does not slip, and pass the bandage around the circumference several times and tighten it firmly, then tie the bandage securely at all times, whenever the tension is relaxed
If necessity dictates, it may be loosened when it is exposed in the place or causes pain or swelling, so do not hesitate to loosen it and apply treatment to what is causing the problem, then reapply the plaster if necessary And keep the tension firm until it heals completely
Eighth Chapter
In the treatment of fractures of the bones if they fracture it is known that fractures occur in the areas where the bone is thick and the branches from the front are more likely to fracture due to their brittleness, and this does not cause pain when examining the fingers
Bones and joints must be repositioned on the face until their shape is normalized. Then, the fractured bone should be stabilized with a splint if necessary. If the fracture is displaced inwards, it indicates a severe injury.
Bones must be repositioned so that the face is normal. Then, the fractured bone should be stabilized using a bandage if necessary. If the fracture is displaced inwards, it indicates a serious injury, which is associated with pain, swelling, bruising and a lot of blood loss. This is a dangerous condition, and early treatment is often difficult.</start_of_turn>
Whoever says that mild food is sufficient to eliminate swelling and pain, and that it will expand the abdomen and expel the fracture outwards – we condemn this. For if this has not happened, it will definitely occur if it has not already happened. In such a case, it will increase the swelling and make the matter worse.</start_of_turn>
Some people support elevation of the wound, while others advise applying pressure. The former is like measurement, except that it does not take into account the weakness of the tissue. Some people suggest covering the wound with wool soaked in warm oil.</start_of_turn>

Sleep should only be on the side that does not have a companion, and go until it is healed. If something has happened at the edge of the bone, such as a fracture, or anything that has healed from it, then it is necessary to make an incision on it and remove that bone.

Chapter XV.
On the Treatment of Bone Fractures.
The arm is that between the shoulder and the elbow. If it fractures on one side, grasp a splint with an intermediate breadth that will stabilize the swelling on this image:
Bind at both ends with ligatures and suspend from a high position. Let the patient sit on a chair, then take the broken limb and place it on the splint until the elbow is fixed to the splint, and then suspend from above something heavy
Or extend it with a servant to the lower part, then the physician grasps the fracture with both hands together until the fracture is in its proper place, and the other side that the patient should lie on their forearm and grasp their hand from the neck with a bandage
Then command the attendants to fasten one above the fracture with both hands and the other below and hold each of them firmly. If you wish for the bandage to be stronger, tighten under the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage and hold each of them firmly by the attendants.
If the fracture is close to the elbow, then one tendon should be passed under the elbow and the other under the fracture towards the scapula. Similarly, if the fracture is close to the scapula, then one tendon should be passed on that side and the other on the scapula itself.
Then the fracture is to be immobilized without tension until it is stable in its proper position and the ligaments are well-healed. If there is no swelling or heat, the tension should be increased gradually. If there is swelling or heat, leave the tension loose until the seventh day and apply an oiled compress to it.
Until the swelling has subsided, then tighten the tension. Put the dressing on the fracture and apply a new bandage over the dressing. Then bring the limb close to the limb itself and put the hand open on the elbow.
And support the forearm and the limb on the limb itself so that the limb can be put in the place of the fractured bone if that does not prevent you from doing so. If you fear that the bone will change, do not use the bone support.
And put on the fracture itself a bandage that is wider and stronger than the other bandages and that will not be narrower than the width of the fracture, but the length of the bandage should be three fingers more on each side of the fracture.</start_of_turn>
Then tighten the sutures that were mentioned earlier in the beginning of the chapter.</start_of_turn>
And the tension of the sutures should be greater in the area of the fracture.</start_of_turn>
And when the fracture is finished, the tension should be less. If you see the position of the bone and the sutures as we have mentioned while you are fixing the limb, do so.</start_of_turn>
If the swelling is painful, loosen the tight bands and the belts. Today is the seventh as we mentioned, and so bind the ligature in every three days lest harm be done in the place or there be swelling or the nourishment be hindered from reaching the organ due to excessive tightening.
If you are confident that nothing of that will happen, do not loosen the ligature until many days have passed. Keep the little bandage on his back and his hand on his belly, and place it under the limb padded with wool of moderate thickness
And bind at all times of the night or day lest the shape of the fractured limb should change or the ligature become loose. Rectify all this with your effort, and make the food soft or light until the bone is healed.
Do not neglect his food, for it is common for the limb and foot to swell for forty days. When this has happened, you must loosen the ligature and use warm compresses and medical treatment for that which will heal it. If the fracture is compound and the bone is exposed, it is harmful.
Do not tighten the ligature for five days or two months.
Chapter 22.
On the Treatment of Fractures of the Arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called the ulna and the radius. The ulna is small and extends from the thumb, while the radius is large and extends from below the elbow to the wrist. The bones may fracture individually or together, and the fracture may be compound, meaning that the bone is exposed, or simple, meaning that the bone is not exposed
When the small ulna fractures above, the wound is easy and the swelling is rapid. When the large ulna fractures below, the fracture is delayed and the swelling is severe. If both bones fracture together, the bone which fractured above the small ulna is most likely to be fractured as well
The physician should adjust the length of his stitches according to the size of the wound. If the wound is large, the stitches should be longer. If all the wounds are large, the stitches should be shorter.
A hand-shaped form should be placed over the wound and the stitches should be extended over a cushion. The thumb should be placed above all the fingers and the wrist should be below the rest of the fingers, with a little space at the base of the thumb resting on itself.
The cushion should be held in an elevated position to prevent the little finger from being bruised.
Then the arm servant grasps the bone from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and the other servant grasps from above also. The surgeon should then suture until the bone is restored to its best possible position, even if there is a fracture
The bone should be returned to its place with effort. If there is a fracture and the skin is not torn and you do not wish to cause further injury, open the wound and remove the fragment as described previously. If there is a fracture with a wound, the fragment has already been separated
The treatment is taken from there. If the limb is in great pain and swelling and the pulse is rapid, with vomiting, but is neither very swollen nor pale, then tighten the dressing slightly and moderately between the pulse and the swelling
When the pulse is grasped and the dressing is loosened, apply salve of barley flour with egg white and carry the bandage and let the part that was placed on the fracture be slightly exposed. Be aware that the number of bones in the arm will be more in most cases.
If a fracture is in one bone or in two bones together, then make your traction stronger on the fracture site and as strong as possible. Make traction stronger above or below the fracture until traction becomes weaker rather than stronger.
If a fracture is in one bone or two bones together, then make your traction stronger on the fracture site and as strong as possible. Make traction stronger above or below the fracture until traction becomes weaker rather than stronger.
If anything breaks, such as a crack in the limb, it must be washed out with water until the crack is healed. Then the limb should be left unstrapped for a night before traction is resumed.
If traction has become weak and the bone has shifted or something of that sort, then do your utmost to repair it. Also watch out if food is not reaching the limb because of the traction, as this necessitates making the traction slightly weaker and leaving it for a while until food reaches the limb, and then traction can be resumed
If nothing further appears to be the matter, do not intervene except after twenty days or so. Then suspend the limb from the neck and keep the arms steady. Maintain your effort from disturbing movements and make the patient sleep on his back.
Remember that a fracture of the arm will usually heal in three weeks or two and a half, or perhaps in eight weeks in the case of severe cases or weakness of the limb
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of fractures of the forearm and fingers.
The swelling of the forearm and the flexibility of the fingers are not as harmful to the fracture as it is to the wound which is often extensive in these cases.
The patient should sit upright on a chair.
Then he places his hand on it [the patient's limb] extended and extends the injured joint and straightens it out until, if it has been reduced well, the patient should bear some weight on it. If no swelling has occurred, he should carry out the fomentation and bandage immediately.
It is possible that I have described it [the procedure] too briefly; if the fracture is downwards towards the palm of the hand, I make a sphere-like dressing and order the patient to grasp it with his injured hand and bind it with a long bandage.</start_of_turn>
The swelling may be contained by a skin graft over the bone, with the bending of all fingers and the tightening of the bandage as required. If the fracture is outwards, it is necessary to make a graft of skin from above and below the joint to make the hand completely open.</start_of_turn>
Then he carries the bandage as is usual for bending the hand and grasps between the fingers with the bandage, if the width of the fracture is between the thumb and index finger, if it is the thumb that is fractured and it is flexible, it should be fixed along with the hand.
It does not move if the fracture is to the rest of the fingers like the middle, ring or little finger, it should be flexible and bound with the healthy fingers or bound altogether with a strong bandage or apply a small cast.</start_of_turn>
As we mentioned in the thumb and stiffness in general when the swelling subsides after reduction, do whatever is necessary to prevent recurrence whenever that may be the case.</start_of_turn>
Chapter fourteen.</start_of_turn>
In the reduction of fractures of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is frequently fractured and causes pain because it rotates forward and backward, and the surrounding tissues are stretched. The ligature above the fracture and the ligature below the fracture must be applied with their tension directed toward the face of the fracture
Then the tension of every ligament must be directed to its place in moderation, for if the fracture is in the middle of the bone, and if it is close to the origin of the thigh, it is necessary to ligate either from wool or something similar
The tension of the ligament must be directed to the hip towards the loin, for the tension of the other ligament is below the fracture as well. If the fracture is close to the knee, then the ligament must be ligated close to the knee so that the tension is directed downwards, and the physician must adjust each tension until it reaches the normal anatomical position.
The bone must be bound firmly so that it can bear the tension and the stretching, for if this does not happen and swelling occurs, it must be evacuated for several days until the swelling subsides, and then the treatment is resumed
And as for the tension, it must be applied firmly and widely around the fracture several or three times and leave some space, and then bind the limb until the knee joint is reached and pass a long thread between the thigh and the leg below the knee and make the ends of the thread from above from both sides.
Then rotate on the thigh and calf what remains of the dressing, and make the knee in the position of the fracture itself and make a bandage one on the bone of the leg, and tie the surrounding tissues together so that the tension is not lost.
Begin by firmly grasping the center of the fracture with three or four fingers. Once secured, gradually loosen and soften your grip.
Then, support the edges of the ligament which you have inserted between the thigh and leg, and bind them to the adjacent tissues above and below. Then, pass the ends of the ligament down to the ankle and grasp them there also.
To prevent the ligament from slipping from its place, leave the tension on it as long as there is no swelling, pain, or puffiness. If anything of that happens, then immediately remedy the situation and restore everything to its original state as we mentioned previously
If the bone is fractured and the joint is dislocated, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation if possible. Otherwise, open the fracture and extract the bone fragment. Treat the wound as described previously until the fracture is healed.
As mentioned previously in the arm and forearm, if the limb is fractured without causing any significant deformity, and the limb is only fractured in one place without involving the leg, then it is not necessary to bind the limb together
Note that the thigh bone may be slightly longer or shorter than usual depending on the condition of the patient and other cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
Regarding fractures of the ankle joint.
The ankle joint is rarely fractured, but it is commonly sprained. If there is a fracture, it can be either a crack or a break, and will be accompanied by either an open or closed wound
Be attentive to every detail, and know how to reunite the scattered parts of the fingers and joints until they conform to their natural position. Then, apply the bandage and secure it with a moderate amount of liquid if necessary.
The bandage should be applied according to the situation, and all conditions mentioned previously in the description of the fracture should be taken into account, such as swelling and displacement.
Chapter XVI.
On the Treatment of Fractures of the Leg.
The leg bone consists of two bones, one thick and called the tibia and the other thin and called the fibula. Both bones can suffer from different types of fractures And in this matter the treatment is the same as for fractures of the arm, whether it is complete or partial. If the fracture is complete, the leg is turned in all directions. If the fracture is of the lower end of the tibia, the leg is turned forward. If the fracture is of the upper end of the tibia, it is turned backward. This is what you must know
Therefore, apply the dressing and immobilization and bandage the fracture according to the situation. Whether or not it is necessary to use more padding depends on the type of fracture of the leg, which may have many fragments. In such a case, use less padding and more restraint of your effort on the fracture
The leg is more laborious than the arm because it has many joints and requires more work to stabilize the compartments between the plates or be made from date palm fibers or something similar.
Choose what has little bulk but covers the entire length of the leg from the knee to the ankle. Then wrap each one around the protrusion and wrap two layers along its length. Place one on the front and the other on the back
Move the heel down to the foot, then join the two sesamoids in three places on the limbs and middle. This arrangement allows the limb to be flexed and extended comfortably, and a chisel of wood may be used along the leg.
And put in it to protect it from movement and more than that which is necessary to do if there is a fracture and there is a special wound, then bandage the limb every day and pay attention to the swelling or puffiness or all of that.</start_of_turn> When any of these things happens, meet them with what is necessary to make it heal, and the bone of the limb will be healed in three days or thereabouts.</start_of_turn>
Seventh Chapter.
In the fracture of a bone of the limb and the fingers.</start_of_turn>
As for the heel, it does not suffer from a fracture of the patella, but as for the bone of the limb it may suffer from a fracture, and the fingers also little that they suffer from a fracture, but they are more likely to suffer from bruising.</start_of_turn
If the bone of the limb is fractured and you see that limb has become swollen from some of the lower parts of the foot to the toes on the ground, then put your foot on what has ascended from that limb and then put down your foot and bandage it well.</start_of_turn
Until it returns to its place, then carry the dressing and the burden from above placing under the heel a small cushion having two flat surfaces, and then tighten it with the foot tightened securely after wrapping it with cotton wool and all that is necessary.</start_of_turn
And if three or four days have passed, loosen the bandage if you find the bone straightened whether it is fractured or broken, and do as you see fit, and as for if some of the fingers are fractured, bandage them and put them in their place as described for the fracture of the hand bones.</start_of_turn
Straighten the broken fingers along their bones and make them slightly narrower, then place the footplate under the foot that was described to you and tighten it securely, if the break is in two or more bones.
Straighten the broken fingers along their bones and make them slightly narrower. Place the footplate under the foot that was described and tighten it securely, leaving the heads of the footplate slightly outside the foot to maintain proper alignment.
Do not forget any of the symptoms that I have mentioned in relation to the fracture, and take notice of every symptom that comes to your attention.
The Eighth Chapter.
In the fracture of the thigh bone of women and the hip bone and it is mentioned in men
When the thigh bone of a woman fractures, put her in a recumbent position and elevate her hip slightly lower than the level of her chest. Fix her from behind with a bandage and cover the fracture with cotton wool until it is filled and becomes like a ball in her thigh
Then put the woman in a sitting position and slightly elevate her hip. If the cotton wool comes out, do not be afraid, for it will come out when the bone is set. Then make her lean back slightly so that she can comfortably urinate without straining the cotton wool too much
Then put her hip in the position in which she was originally placed. Leave her like that for seven days or so. If it has healed, or if you wish, take a piece of charcoal and put a tube in her mouth and pass the charcoal through her rectum into her thigh.
Then blow up the tube with force until the bladder is full in the thigh. The fracture will be set. Then cover with cotton wool and keep it for as long as we have described until it is healed. As for the hip bone of a man or a woman, we use it in its place.</start_of_turn>
The fracture does not deviate from what we described concerning the hip bone; it is not alien to you in these unusual fractures that do not occur frequently, especially among those who have some experience and understand this book well.
The correct path is to keep the limb still and firm, and understand it well. As for the man who has fractured his thigh, we will describe the position in which he should be placed, then apply a dressing and bandage and leave it for three days or so until it heals.</start_of_turn>
Chapter Nineteen.</start_of_turn>
In the treatment of fractures of the bones associated with a wound.</start_of_turn
It is necessary for the one who is presenting a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large such as the femur or the ulna, to delay the excision of the surrounding soft tissues from the time of injury until it has healed.
If the wound is bleeding blood, it is necessary to delay excision and apply powdered charcoal over it until the bleeding stops. Then take hold of the fracture in that day and do not neglect it.</start_of_turn>
If there is no swelling, but there is swelling later, leave the limb still for nine days until the swelling subsides and does not recur in the next three days. Otherwise, it exposes him to further evils.</start_of_turn
If the fractured bone is exposed and visible, it is necessary to cover it with a dressing and hold it with the hands and fingers, and if it does not respond to your hands and fingers individually, do it with this tool, which is made of iron and is seven or eight fingers long.</start_of_turn> Apply it to the wound.
The physician should take three or four of these [medications] according to the amount required for the treatment of each type of fracture, so that the dose is moderate and does not cause them to fall off at the time of work.
It should be thick at the top and thin at the bottom, and its sweetness should be such that it is neither too strong nor too weak. This is its best form
It is called the Greek plaster, and its quantity should be such that its thick end is fixed to the bony prominences and it is pressed over them until the bone is restored to its normal position, and some degree of displacement is thus eliminated from the fracture of some parts with others.
If its fractured limb is flexible and the instrument is not sufficient, it should be sectioned off until the instrument is capable of holding it, and if this is not possible, then cut off only that part of the bone which is necessary for the treatment, as we have mentioned before
Or draw out the fragments through one of the holes, as much as possible, then remove the remaining fragments of bone and cartilage, for if the bone is restored to its natural position and there is still pain, know that the bone has not returned to its proper place
If you are able to restore it to its natural position, do so, for this will be of great benefit, but if you leave the fracture unreduced, soak the wound in black cumin and especially if it is summer, and do not place any covering over the wound or anything greasy on it.
To prevent infection and decay, then apply the plaster while the limb is still flexible and leave the wound open to air and cover only with a bandage that will adhere to the wound surface on the amount of the wound.
Beware of excessive tension when stitching the wound with a fracture, as this is often the cause of serious complications among physicians, leading to disease, death, or impaired healing.
If the wound is slight or a large wound with some accompanying symptoms that we have described and which is found to be in a precarious position, it is not permissible to apply stitches and make a solid ligature in that area
If after a day or two you observe pus forming in the wound or if the swelling subsides somewhat and the pain persists, it is necessary to remove the sutures and apply ointments that we have mentioned previously, such as beeswax ointment or the like, and you should avoid tension in the suture
The wound should be examined every evening and morning until it heals completely, and care should be taken to prevent excessive tension on the wound, as small bone fragments may have fractured.
The wound should be drained with forceps and whatever fragments are loose should be removed, while any fragments that are firmly embedded should be left alone and only removed when the tissue is excised and the pain is relieved
If the wound is wide, deep or of another kind of infection and inflammation, it is necessary to treat each variety according to its description in the chapter on treatment.
And as for large bones such as the thigh bone or the forearm bone which are major organs, take care not to grasp or extract them violently. This often leads to death rather than saving the limb. Leave it alone until it naturally sloughs off after twenty days or so
The wound should be treated if you see any place where treatment is necessary, and if not, leave it alone.
The Tenth Chapter.
Treatment of injuries resulting from some fractures
This injury often does not appear as a result of bone fractures, especially if located close to a joint. This may cause deformation of the limb and may also prevent the limb from functioning properly
If the wound is soft, use astringents such as alum, aloe, myrrh, saffron, or chamomile. Take some of these or all of them with alum or white lead or vinegar
It is fixed on the wound in tension and tightened well and left without loosening for several days, then it is loosened and renewed until the wound disappears, God willing, or a sheet of lead is placed over it
Lead has a special property that eliminates whatever is harmful. If the wound has become obstructed due to tension and tightening, and the necessity has increased, it is to split it from above and below the surrounding tissue or remove some of the surrounding tissue until the wound heals and the treatment is completed
The Tenth Chapter
Treatment of fractures if they have subsided and the limb remains stiff compared to its previous state.
If a fracture has subsided and the limb remains stiff, this is due to various reasons Possible reasons include excessive tightening of the ligaments and their fixation in an inappropriate manner, excessive tension of the ligaments to the point that blood flow to the limb is obstructed, excessive mobility of the limb at an inappropriate time, or insufficient blood in the limb due to weakness or other causes.
Treatment for that should be elevation of the limb and reinforcement of its substance until blood flow increases and the application of warmth and incision on it and the application of soothing herbs and similar methods, then support the wound on the organ to attract food or to prevent its recurrence with cold water. Until food is restored to it and it returns to its natural shape
The Twenty-Second Chapter
In the treatment of fractured bones if they have not been displaced and their action is hindered on what is beneficial.
When the limb has been exposed after displacement of a fracture or sprain of a fractured bone or its fixation and swelling has subsided for that reason. It is not permissible for the limb to be left without action in its natural state as many ignorant people and impostors do in our land claim that the limb will heal on its own.
This action is harmful indeed and leads to great harm, but if displacement and swelling are slight, it is permissible to apply cold water which has been boiled with soothing herbs such as chamomile and rue and mint and similar things
and it can be applied with ointment of rue leaves and vinegar of alum or extract of rue and butter of chicken fat and ghee or mixture of dates and barley and similar medicines
and the swelling subsides with prolonged rubbing which is done with the hand and the movement of the limb is required in all directions at all times, and if displacement has occurred and become great and treatment by iron is required
Therefore the bone must be fractured again and its connection severed and whatever remains of the fracture or the bone must be excised and the wound must be supported with care and attention, then the wound must be treated as mentioned until it heals completely
The Third Chapter and Twenty.
The jaw is when a joint protrudes from its place, hindering movement, deforming the limb, and causing severe pain. Therefore, if one of the jaws is exposed, it is necessary to immobilize it from time to time until it heals.
It does not require reduction if it is only a swelling that accompanies the protrusion. However, it should not be moved or rotated, as this often causes additional tension and pain
But if it is exposed, it is necessary to reduce the protrusion first, then leave it until the swelling subsides somewhat. Then, wash the limb with warm water and oil, and reduce the protrusion again in its place.
The sections of the jaw may also be immobilized according to the degree of displacement from the top of the body to the bottom
The Fourth Chapter and Twenty
Regarding the Treatment of Lower Jaw Injuries
The lower jaw is not affected except for bruises and fractures. If it is displaced from its place, it may either be displaced towards the cheek or completely fractured. In the first case, it relaxes somewhat and partially, and in the second case, it is completely fractured until it relaxes Until the saliva of the lower lip drools and it is no longer able to bite or speak, as if it were relaxed. In this case, it often returns to its original position on its own without any effort
If the fracture is complete, it is necessary to expedite its reduction and not wait for it to reduce on its own. The attendant should grasp the head of the mandible and the physician should insert his thumb into the pulp of the tooth if the jaw is fractured from one side only
If the jaw is fractured from both sides and all the other fingers and thumbs are displaced outwards, it must be reduced immediately. The physician must order the patient to relax the jaw and open it wide so that the fractured fragments can be repositioned.
If the jaw is fractured on both sides and all the fingers and thumbs are displaced outwards, use water and fat compresses until reduction is possible without causing further damage. If reduction is achieved and the jaw is stable, order the patient to relax the jaw and open it wide.
Then secure the jaw relaxed with a bandage. Keep the patient supine with the head supported by two pillows so that it does not move forward or backward and does not put pressure on anything. It must make swallowing comfortable but should not be painful.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is healed, let him eat whatever he wants. Do not tighten the bandage or force the patient to open his mouth while eating or drinking until the jaw is healed and comfortable.
If the jaw fractures remain displaced even after healing, this may cause persistent pain and swelling, and the patient may vomit frequently or suffer from severe abdominal pain. If you notice any of these symptoms, know that the fracture has not healed properly
It often happens that this is noticed within ten days.
The fifth and twenty-ninth chapters.
On reduction of jaw fractures and displacement of the earlobe.
If the fracture is not from the inside but from outside, it will be evident from pain, and the patient must lie on his back and raise his arms.
If you tighten the tissue with your thumb and index finger, then apply the unguent and the dressing, and bind them, except for the part which reaches the navel and is connected to the flesh. Only in the wound should you leave an opening, except in the case where it is necessary to drain and thus restore what has been mentioned previously and what we have stated.
Apply the unguent and dressing, bind them, and command a little elevation of the limb until it heals. In this way the part of the navel which remained will recover in its place.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XXVI.</start_of_turn>
The Treatment of the Navel Defect.</start_of_turn>
Know that the navel has three aspects, one of which is that it may rupture downwards towards the flank, the second that it may rupture towards the chest, and the third that it may rupture towards the upper part of the navel itself.
It does not rupture behind the shoulder nor in front of the nerve. It most commonly ruptures downwards towards the flank, especially in those who have little fat because it comes out quickly and goes in quickly.</start_of_turn
As for those who have much fat, it is different. In them it comes out slowly and goes in slowly. Sometimes a wound or a fracture is seen, which makes the people think that the navel has burst, so they must examine it until they are certain that it has healed.</start_of_turn
Treatment advances in its course. If you find that the swelling has gone down towards the flank, if you find between the navel and the healthy navel a space that feels hard and solid, and if you touch the head of the navel you will find a swelling there like an egg that is pressed down.</start_of_turn
It is impossible for the cause (disease or injury) to elevate the hand to the ears or to move it through all its motions. Similarly, if it extends towards the chest or above, the patient will perceive it as obvious (palpable) rather than hidden.
This condition may be easily recognized. If the cause is a tremor or the patient is young, ask the patient to raise their hand above their head. Then make the patient grasp their hand under their armpit and raise the elbow with force to the above-mentioned position. The patient will then raise their hand and move it upwards.</start_of_turn>
Then lower it down quickly. If it returns immediately, but does not return as described previously, the cause has been present for a long time. In this case, the patient should be bathed in hot water and given laxatives such as acacia, aloes and senna.</start_of_turn>
Then place the patient on their back and put under their armpit a cushion of wool that is neither too soft nor too firm. The physician should grasp the hand with their hand and pull the limb downwards.</start_of_turn>
Push the cushion downwards until it returns to its original position. If desired, repeat the process using a longer bougie and passing the limb under the armpit. Raise the armpit to above the level of the head until the limb is suspended in the air.</start_of_turn> The other attendant will grasp the limb downwards towards the patient's abdomen. If the cause is hidden, something else must be applied to support it. If it returns at its usual time, it may also return in another place.
The limb should be placed on a long, blunt object like the heel of a stool. The head of the object should be rounded, neither thick nor thin. Place it under the armpit after placing a fracture above the elbow. The patient should be supported on the limb as it stands on the fracture.</start_of_turn
If the limb is displaced downwards from its normal position, and the body also from its normal position, with force, the articulation will return to its place quickly. If the displacement is great, it will take a long time for it to return. Use this treatment: take a stick about the length of two arms. If the limb is displaced downwards from its normal position, and the body also from its normal position, with force, the articulation will return to its place quickly. If the displacement is great, it will take a long time for it to return. Use this treatment: take a stick about the length of two arms and place its lower end under the armpit on this image, and its upper end under the elbow of the limb that is displaced downwards, and tighten it with four fingers and leave the tip of the stick exposed by two fingers.
If the limb is displaced downwards from its normal position, and the body also from its normal position, with force, the articulation will return to its place quickly. If the displacement is great, it will take a long time for it to return. Use this treatment: take a stick about the length of two arms and place its lower end under the armpit and its upper end under the elbow of the limb that is displaced downwards, and tighten it with four fingers and leave the tip of the stick exposed by two fingers. Then, bind the stick to the head with a bandage so that it does not slip. Then, place the hand and forearm on the stick and bind the stick to the arm and forearm at the elbow and wrist
Then, place the limb on the opposite side. Keep the limb stretched and extend the hand downwards and leave the rest of the body relaxed on the other side. The articulation will enter by itself. If you force it from any side, you may damage something. So put under the armpit a cushion the size of a fist of wool.
Then, carry the prepared dressing from the armpit with flour, butter and egg whites on the neck all around as it rotates from above. Then, tighten the ball under the armpit tightly and securely, and bind it with a bandage from above and fix the hand to the neck.
Leave the hand still for seven days. Keep the diet light until the limb has healed. It will recover after seven days or five days. And if it has not recovered, keep it still and do not move it until it has healed.
If the joint dislocates frequently due to excessive pressure or other factors, it is appropriate to use three ligatures in the joint opening. When this is done and the ligament is released after seven days, the joint will not be stabilized.
The joint has dislocated repeatedly despite repeated ligatures. It has become loose and floppy, and cannot be raised above its normal position. Know that the nerve at the root of the elbow may be severed, stretched or floppy, so know that the joint will never stabilize in its place
The elbow joint is displaced toward the chest and the shoulder and toward the back. It must be pushed and pulled by the hands until it returns. Ligatures and treatment are used until it heals. The width after healing is narrowed and the movement is smoother
Do not use too much pressure repeatedly until the swelling subsides and the joint returns to its natural position.
Seventh day.
In the treatment of elbow dislocation.
The elbow joint dislocates forward and backward as well as to the sides. Be aware that it is painful and visible from all aspects, especially from the front and back.
If you splint the elbow correctly, you will see that it is displaced and cannot be flexed or moved by its own weight. It is important to reduce and reposition the elbow before swelling increases
If swelling increases around the elbow, it must be reduced and the elbow must be repositioned immediately. This is especially important if the elbow is displaced towards the back. Neglecting this can lead to serious complications, including death of the nerve
If the patient is unable to return the hand which he has grasped due to pain in the wrist and forearm, the physician should place his thumb and index finger over the wrist joint and under the base of the thumb, and grasp the hand from the palm of the hand to the wrist joint, or from the wrist joint to the base of the thumb.
If the elbow is high up, he should return the hand once to strike the base of the thumb which opposes it. If it is not necessary to return the elbow, then use strong pressure and grasp the limb firmly.</start_of_turn>
Grasp the forearm and thumb firmly to prevent them from slipping away. Grasp the limb from the palm of the hand to the wrist or from the wrist to the base of the thumb. If the elbow is too high, return the limb once to strike the base of the thumb which opposes it. If it is not necessary to return the elbow, use strong pressure and grasp the limb firmly.</start_of_turn>
Grasp the forearm and thumb firmly to prevent them from slipping away. Grasp the limb from the palm of the hand to the wrist or from the wrist to the base of the thumb. If the elbow is too high, return the limb once to strike the base of the thumb which opposes it. If it is not necessary to return the elbow, use strong pressure and grasp the limb firmly. Then push the elbow forcefully until it returns to its place. After it returns, support the limb with padding, plaster or bandage and tighten it securely.

If there is any swelling after the elbow returns to its place, repeat the procedure.</start_of_turn>
If movement is difficult due to swelling in the bath or mild and severe blisters, let the limb be suspended from a support like a thick cushion, bind it and leave it there for a day or two. Then remove the support and bathe the limb. If there is still swelling, reapply the support as needed.
Then reapply the support once or twice more while bathing until the swelling subsides. If you wish to make it more secure, apply a thick dressing of butter and wool over the swelling and bind it tightly around the limb. Repeat this several times until the swelling subsides and returns to its original state
The eighth and twentieth chapters.
On treating a fractured jawbone.
The wrist is often fractured and the jaw is easily fractured. It is better to wait until the fracture has subsided somewhat before applying any dressing or bandage to prevent further injury to the surrounding area or causing swelling and heat
The jaw should be placed on a board and a servant should hold the limb. The physician should then apply a bandage to the fracture and support the limb until it has healed. However, it should be observed whether the fracture has subsided or not
Place the hand over the board when elevating and lowering the limb. If the jaw has progressed to the surface of the hand, place the hand pad of the physician on the same eminence as the fracture, so that the physician's hand does not rest on the fracture itself. If it subsides from time to time, do not bind it tightly with the bandage
Leave it untouched if it does not cause him any pain or discomfort. The limb may still be fractured even after several days, but this will not cause any additional harm.
The nerve is either severed or stretched. There is no remedy except to tie it with a ligature. Sometimes this proves beneficial, sometimes not. If the nerve is restored, carry out the medication we have prescribed and then tie and leave it for five days.
When the hand is healed and the limb is moved, if it still exhibits pain or stiffness, let it be bathed in warm water and massaged repeatedly until it softens
Chapter XXIX-XX.
On treating finger fractures.
The fingers may be fractured in any direction. When a finger is fractured at the base of the thumb or at the wrist, stretch the finger and support the fracture with your thumb until it returns to its place. Then tie the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the side which was fractured
And leave it for two days. Then take it off, stretch and move it until its position is regained. If at night you tie it according to the prescription, do not remove it during the day and keep stretching and moving it. Tie it at night only
Similarly, if the fracture is inside the hand, tie it towards the side itself and do the above-mentioned procedures until it heals
Chapter XXXI.
On treating fractures of the thumb joint
When a fracture occurs at the tip of the thumb or the wrist joint or if many fractures have deviated from their place, there is no remedy because death is imminent
And it is known that the pain of death often escapes without will and often causes the loss of some of its limbs, or the hand or the foot, or one of them. And if one fracture deviates from its place, many times it does not heal.
The swelling will vanish towards four directions, and when it reaches the back it is called a 'lip.' As for its treatment, if the lip occurred from youth, there is no treatment for it, and there is no remedy for it in the realm of practice. As for that which occurred from a fall or blow or the like.
The initial part of the treatment has been omitted from the explanation of the remedy, for it is lengthy and does not return more benefit. Much has been omitted from it concerning that which is close to the meaning and explanation, and the description of the instrument which contradicts what is shown and explained.
I say that the lip which occurs from the chest forward has no remedy, neither is there any for that which occurs from the sides. However, that which occurs from the back is treated by stretching the face outwards
Over the counter of a stall near the wall, and straighten the skin under it and tighten the flesh of the abdomen so that it does not injure the chest. Then place a wooden splint fixed at the neck and another at the ankles on the other side of the stall towards the head and another at the ankles on the other side of the stall.
A servant grasps the splint and makes it loose in the pit and another servant grasps the other on that body. Then he tightens the collar and the abdomen over the chest and the thighs, and stretches the folds of the abdomen towards the splint which is at the neck and connects it there.
Then tighten another fold over the hips and thighs and at the armpits and connect the cords together at the other splint which is at the ankles. The servant then pulls each cord towards its pole and connects them securely so that the splints do not move from their place.
Do not make them loose as we have said. The physician places his hand on the bulge with force until it returns or places a board upon it and rests upon the board on the ankle until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, take a board which is about the length of three fingers.
A hole is drilled in the bone we mentioned previously, close to the lesser wing. A piece of bone is placed in the middle of the wing and the bone is placed on the eminence. The physician places his hands on the other end and grasps firmly until the fracture is compressed.
The fragment returns to its place. If you wish to secure it with a loop, make a hole at the head of the lesser wing and at the base of the fragment, each hole being the length of a forearm.
The fragment is now secured by bone fragments inserted at the head and base of the lesser wing. The loop that was made to secure the fragment is passed through holes drilled in the bone fragments.
The loop that was made to secure the fragment is passed through holes drilled in the bone fragments at both the head and base of the lesser wing. The fragment is also secured by a bone fragment placed at the head and another at the base of the fragment.
The physician stands beside the loop and grasps it with his hand, which grasps the loop. The physician then positions the fracture fragment appropriately over the eminence.
After the fragment is returned and properly positioned, the dry dressing is applied over the fracture site. Then the bandage is placed over the dressing and over the eminence. A piece of bone is then placed on top of the bandage, measuring approximately the width of three fingers or thereabouts, and extending to the height of the eminence
The dressing is then applied over the fracture, followed by the bandage. A piece of bone is placed on top of the bandage, measuring approximately the width of three fingers. The limb should be kept elevated until the pain subsides.
The application of resin may be used in this case, and there may be swelling at the end of the loin cuts which may cause displacement of the surplus bone, and this may not be harmful.
The loin cuts.
In the treatment of fractured pelvis.
I know that the hip joint and the knee joint are susceptible only to fracture, and do not suffer from laxity or dislocation, and the hip joint is fractured in four places.</start_of_turn>
And it is known that it fractures inwards and outwards and forwards and backwards, and most often fractures inwards and least often forwards or backwards, and the sign of fracture is that if you join the healthy limb to the patient, it will be longer.</start_of_turn
The hip is more flexible than the knee and the limb cannot be straightened at the hip when the knee is flexed, and the position which the limb reaches before the hip joint has reached that place.</start_of_turn>
The sign that the fracture is outwards is that the patient is unable to walk without pain, while if the limb is straightened at the hip despite the knee being straightened, this is indicative of fracture of the hip.</start_of_turn
He clutches his thigh and leans on his crutches and when he walks his heel is lifted off the ground, and the sign that the fracture is backwards is that the hip cannot be straightened and cannot be flexed before the hip joint is flexed, and his leg is also shorter than the other.</start_of_turn
The hip joint is relaxed and the head of the femur is in its place, and as for the rest of these types of fracture, look if the fracture is old and has become chronic and has not been treated, and remains in the same state, there is no treatment for it.</start_of_turn
It is not permissible to expose him [the patient], and as for what has recently occurred and was of any kind, from the various aspects of the jaw, it is necessary that the articulation should be loosened and extended inwards and outwards and that it should be made to move easily in every direction.
It is not appropriate to resort to anything other than treatment, and if that does not suffice, it is necessary to make a strong hand either with the thumb or with the fingers or with a strap that binds over the thigh below the knee and another hand that extends from above the knee
The hand should enter from under the armpit and grasp the thigh from its origin, and a third hand should hold the end of the strap. It should be extended either from the front towards the buttock or from the back towards the loin.
Their extension should be simultaneous until the limb rises from the ground and remains suspended, for this type of extension is common to the four types, and if the jaw is not returned as we have mentioned, it is necessary for each type to have the appropriate treatment.
If the jaw is towards the inside, it is necessary to place the limb on its correct side and then to stretch the strap over the origin of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the area under the buttock
Then the strap is stretched from the buttock towards the top of the body towards the loin and another hand grasps the thick part of the thigh and extends it outwards with great force, and when it returns to its place
This type is easier than the rest of the treatments, for if you are unable to do this type of treatment, it is necessary to bind all the limbs with a strong strap that binds over the ankle and the knee
Following each patient is a quantity equivalent to four fingers. The upper leg is extended more than the others by the amount of two fingers. Then the heel is suspended from the head by a splint that is in the house, and after that from the ground by the amount of an arm.
Then command a strong servant to grasp the thigh and suspend the heel from another servant, and the other servant grasps the thigh with strength. If the knee returns to its place quickly, and there is no displacement, the reaction is normal.
The heel should be suspended on the dressing as we described in the owner of the limb and tighten the ligament on the upper leg and the chest. Then place the splint at the ankle and the other at the head, and place the splint of the thigh in the middle of the dressing securely
It may have a wet fracture so that the heel will not go down between the thighs. Then let each servant go to his place and the physician will stabilize the hip with his hands. If the knee returns, then it is normal.
And if you place the board and support it as we mentioned in the limb, whether the heel is to the right or the left, if the ankle is displaced forward, then you must extend the upper leg with force, and this is described in the dressing above
The physician places his right hand on the upper leg and his left hand grasps it and with that press down firmly towards the knee, although with all this the pressure is extended downwards towards the ankle, and if the ankle is displaced backwards it is necessary to extend the limb downwards.
It is high on the ground but it is necessary for it to be fixed to something solid as it is also necessary that the ligaments should be detached from the bone outwards as we mentioned concerning the displacement of the limb on the dressing, and this is on its face and the ligaments are tightened
The hip socket should also be plastered on the [bone] where the joint emerges. If the hip joint has fully returned to its proper position and its sign of return is not concealed, extend the lower limb.
If the limb is stable and the lower limb is flexed and extended without difficulty, know that the limb has returned to its proper position. Then tighten the thigh muscles and support the joint firmly so that the hip does not shift from its place.
And keep the limb still for three or four days, then remove the dressing and bandage and move the limb. If you see no tremor, know that the fracture has healed and the limb is ready to walk, even if you still see some swelling.
Keep the limb still for three days and bandage it firmly. Then remove the dressing and bandage after three days and begin walking on it as soon as possible, God willing
The second and third days.
In the treatment of hip fractures.
The hip joint dislocates in three directions: inwards, outwards, downwards and backwards, but not forwards. The sign of a dislocated hip is that the lower limb is drawn towards the buttock
If the thigh muscle is not grasped, know that the hip is dislocated. Grasp all aspects of the dislocation so that the lower limb is drawn downwards and slightly behind the buttock and forward towards the buttocks, then sit on the thigh muscle
Fix your back against his buttock and bring your knee between your thighs. Then grasp the limb with your hands and support it under the knee with your other hand. Extend the limb until the hip joint returns to its normal position
The limb is to be fixed to the thigh in a non-constrained joint, then the limb is to be bound and the limb is to be fixed to the thigh, and then all three are to be bound together for three or four days, and then they are to be released. No other walk is to be used until the limb has healed.
If you are unable to return it as described, then use moderate force in the ligatures which are recommended in the treatment of the hip until it returns
Chapter 33.
In the treatment of hip displacement
The hip may be dislocated forward or backward and the limb may be either flexed or extended. The sign of dislocation is that the hip is seen protruding outwards from its socket
Or if it has been dislocated from the socket, one must sit with the foot resting firmly on the ground and hold it firmly by hand from behind the loin in the middle.
Then grasp your right hand with your left hand, and your left hand from under the foot, at the ankle joint. Then pull the foot up with your right hand, then with your left hand, twice, and then stretch it with your left hand and press the heel of the foot outwards towards the leg without forcing.
Do this twice as we have described, then press the front of the foot towards the leg in the third attempt and keep grasping the ankle joint, until it returns in one or two attempts. If you see the foot level and straight, do not do anything further.
If you are unable to return it as described, then use moderate force in the ligatures which are recommended in the treatment of the hip until it returns.
If the patient extends his hand or arm, the assistant grasps it by the palm and places the thumb between the thighs, applying pressure until the body does not sink down when the hand or arm is extended. The physician then steadies the patient's hand with his hands.
If the limb is grasped too tightly, the physician should relax the grasp immediately if the pulse returns. If the pulse persists despite relaxation, secure the limb firmly with sutures and bands, and bind the foot to the ankle with a slip knot that can be adjusted later.</start_of_turn>
If the binding is too tight, it will damage the limb. Leave it loose for two or three days, and if the binding is relaxed, tighten it again on the fourth or fifth day. The patient should not walk for forty days.</start_of_turn>
If the limb was not moved before this period, it will not recover and will not accept treatment afterwards. If it swells, it is necessary to apply treatment for the swelling in a different location from the main treatment and continue the treatment until the swelling subsides.</start_of_turn>
Day forty-three.</start_of_turn>
Treatment for finger fractures in men.</start_of_turn>
The swelling must be remedied by gradual elevation, not by violent elevation, as this would cause discomfort. If the fracture is on the outer side of the ankle, the patient should keep his foot flat on the ground.</start_of_turn
Or on a board, while standing like a cripple, then put your foot on what remains of that joint and grasp it with your foot with force until it returns and you see that it has become firm and no swelling has reappeared.</start_of_turn
If the foot is hollow, make under it a board and grasp the foot firmly. It will have two heads. Tighten it securely and hold it for three days. Then remove it and bandage it until it heals and is able to walk without discomfort for many days, God willing.

In cases of fracture or wound or both together.
When any of these things happens and the treatment is applied to the fracture, and the swelling subsides, the limb will not die
And it is not necessary for such treatment to be repeated except for those who are experienced in surgery and are skilled in healing and patient and do not fear hardship and do not hesitate in using whatever medicines will relieve the swelling and pain only and do not neglect the little things.
Praise be to God only, except for those who hope for safety from the physicians with relief from the disease and see some hope in it. Return to Him in the first instance before the swelling increases
If it returns to its place, use the medicines that relieve the swelling and treat the wound, whatever relieves it of the pain and harm. If the limb is fractured and there are displaced fragments, remove them. Follow what we have mentioned in the simple diseases and what is beyond them.
And relinquish your toil and anxieties and do not be drawn into the path of the abyss for what you have advanced and your advice. May God preserve your work and your safety if He wills
