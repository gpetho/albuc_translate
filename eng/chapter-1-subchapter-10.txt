 CHAPTER TEN.
On cauterizing for epilepsy.
 The epileptic who may be cauterized is he whose epilepsy arises from phlegm.
When the patient is an adult and can stand taking the drugs, he should first purify his brain by great electuaries and the rest of the treatment mentioned in that section.
But if it be a boy unable to tolerate the drugs he should employ gargles and medicaments to chew, to clear his brain, for several days beforehand, with an improvement in his diet.
Then let his head be shaved and burn him with the single cauterization on the middle of the head in the manner described before, and with one cauterization on the occiput, and one on each frontal prominence; and, if the patient be fit and able to bear it, add those additional cauterizations on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae that we have already described for paralysis and for flaccidity.
The cautery should be olivary, the shape before described.
If the patient be a boy, use a fine cautery.
