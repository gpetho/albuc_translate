Chapter thirty-six on the treatment of swelling of the tonsils and what grows in the throat from other swellings.	CHAPTER THIRTY-six. On the treatment of swelling of the tonsils and other swellings in the throat.	0.8585729
Swellings resembling those that appear externally, called tonsils, may occur inside the throat.	Sometimes there occur in the throat buboes called 'tonsils', which resemble the buboes occurring externally.	0.7508663
If you treat them with what I mentioned in the chapter and they do not heal, then observe: if the swelling is hard, livid in color, and has little sensation, do not touch it with an instrument.	When you have employed the remedies described in their own place, without effect, examine, and if the tumour be hard, dark coloured, and devoid of sensation, do not touch it with an instrument.	0.71704054
And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not touch it with an instrument either, for fear of bleeding. Rather, leave it until it ripens, so that you either lance it or it bursts on its own.	If it be of a red colour, with a thick root, do not touch this with an instrument either, for fear of a haemorrhage; but let it be till it come to a head; then you may perforate it or let it burst of its own accord.	0.8610623
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is the one that should be cut.	But if it be pale coloured, round, with a slender pedicle, this is the kind that should be cut.	0.7885139
And the procedure for it is that you look before the operation, if its hot swelling has subsided completely or decreased somewhat, then you should sit the patient beside the sun with his head in your lap, and open his mouth, and take an assistant to stand in front of you to press his tongue down with an instrument like this image:	The operation for this is first to see, before operating, whether his inflamed tumour has already completely subsided or to some extent diminished. Then make the patient sit down in the full light of the sun with his head in your lap; open his mouth; and have an assistant before you to press back the tongue with an instrument like this.	0.83104813
It is made of silver or copper, and it is thin like a knife.	It should be made of bronze or silver, and slender like a knife.	0.835956
So when you press the tongue with it, and the swelling becomes clear to you, and your sight falls upon it	And when the tongue is depressed with its help, the tumour will be made manifest to you and your direct vision will fall upon it.	0.7349261
then take a hook and insert it into the tonsil and pull it outwards as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes with it.	Then take a hook and fix it in one tonsil and pull it forward as far as it will go; but be careful to not pull away with it any of the mucosa.	0.7567408
Then you cut it with an instrument of this form: it resembles scissors except that its two ends are curved. The mouth of each one of them, next to the other, is very sharp.	Then cut it with an instrument of this form; it is like scissors except that its extremities are curved, the beak of each meeting the other, and very sharp.	0.8709182
It is made from Indian iron or Damascene steel.	It should be made of Indian iron or Damascene steel.	0.91949093
If this instrument is not available Otherwise, cut it with a scalpel	If you have not this kind of instrument, cut it with a scalpel of this form, on the one side sharp, on the other quite blunt.	0.6440137
So after you cut one tonsil, you cut the other one in the same way,	And when one tonsil has been cut away, remove the other in exactly the same manner.	0.7457787
Then after the cutting, the patient gargles with cold water or vinegar and water,	Then after the excision let the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.	0.90296906
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops then treat him until he recovers.	But if there occur a haemorrhage let him gargle with water in which have been boiled pomegranate peel or myrtle leaves or similar styptics till the haemorrhage is stanched; then treat till healed.	0.8946074
And other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils, and you cut them in the same way as I mentioned in cutting the tonsils.	Sometimes there grow in the fauces tumours other than the tonsils; remove them just as described for tonsils.	0.6874415
I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, tending towards numbness, with little sensation, which almost blocked the throat and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage	I once treated a woman for a tumour that had grown in her throat and was rather dark in colour and had little sensation.	0.663046
and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage and it had prevented her from eating and drinking water and she was close to death if she had remained a day or two	It had almost blocked the throat and the woman had only a narrow opening to breathe through, and was quite prevented from eating or drinking, so that she was at death's door, if she had so remained for a day or two.	0.7523616
and two branches had risen from the tumor until they came out of her nostrils	From the tumour there arose two offshoots, which had eventually emerged through the nostrils.	0.6044754
so I hurried and inserted a hook into one of them then I pulled it and a good piece was pulled out of it	So I made the utmost haste and, fixing a hook in one of them, drew it forward, and out came a sizeable piece.	0.78579766
then I cut it where I reached it from the nostril	Then I cut it off where I had hold of it near the nostril.	0.794714
then I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril	Then I did the same with the one projecting from the other nostril.	0.8457341
then I opened her mouth and pressed down her tongue then I inserted the hook into the tumor itself then I cut some of it and only a little blood flowed from it	Then I opened her mouth and depressed the tongue; then fastened the hook in the tumour itself and cut off a part of it, with only a little haemorrhage; and the woman's pharynx was freed and immediately she had a drink of water, then took some food.	0.8217342
so we continued to cut from that tumor repeatedly for a long time	And from time to time, for long after, I continued to cut away this tumour.	0.66265965
So I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside the throat from above so it stopped growing	Then I went about it astutely and cauterized the tumour high up in the throat, and it stopped growing.	0.6781144
then I traveled away from the area and I did not know what God did with her after me.	Then the woman left the district and I do not know what God has done with her since I had charge of her.	0.8014344
