Chapter XXIX
On the treatment of finger dislocation.
Sometimes fingers are dislocated in various directions.
When a finger is dislocated towards the back or the palm, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Then support the finger tip and suspend it towards the dislocated direction, leaving it for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened on that same day.
At night, bandage it as described, and during the day, unwrap and exercise it, rebandaging it at night; do this for several days until it is stable.
Do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm, bandaging it in that direction and performing the initial treatment until it is healed.
Similarly, do the same when dislocated in other directions.
