Chapter fifty-two on the treatment of umbilical hernia.	CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO. On the treatment of protruding navel.	0.81608355
The protrusion of the navel happens for many reasons: either from a tear in the peritoneum over the abdomen, from which the omentum or the intestine emerges, as happens in all hernias, or from blood that flows from a vein or artery, as mentioned before, or from wind that accumulates in it.	The navel becomes prominent from many causes; either from a rupture of the peritoneum over the abdomen, so that omentum or intestine comes through it as in other ruptures; or from blood extravasation from an artery or vein, as we have mentioned; or else from wind trapped in it.	0.8813579
If it is from a tear in the peritoneum and the exit of the omentum, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body, and it is soft, without pain, and appears in different positions. If it is because of the exit of the intestine, then its state is, along with what we have described, more variable, and if you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then comes back, and perhaps it is accompanied by a gurgling, and it increases greatly when entering the bath and with intense fatigue.	If it be due to ruptured peritoneum and protruding omentum, the colour of the tumour will be the same as the rest of the body; it will be soft and painless and will seem to change its position; But if it be due to an escape of bowel the change of position, compared with what we have described, will be greater, and it will disappear on digital pressure, and then will recur; and often there will be crepitus with it, and it will increase in size on entering the bath or on violent exertion.	0.81573176
If it is from moisture, then it is soft, does not disappear if you press it with your hand, and does not increase or decrease.	If it be due to fluid, it will be soft and will not disappear on manual pressure, nor will it grow larger or smaller.	0.8147689
If it is from blood, then, along with these signs, the swelling appears dark.	If it be due to blood, then in addition to these signs the tumour will appear blackish.	0.8608639
If it is from growing flesh, then the swelling is hard, and remains at one size.	If it arise from a fleshy overgrowth, the tumour will be solid and hard, remaining always constant in bulk.	0.7661265
If it is from wind, then its touch is soft.	If it be due to wind, it will be soft to the touch.	0.8614493
And the action in this is that you observe. If the protrusion of the navel is from the blood of the artery or the vein or wind, then you should refrain from treating it, as there is fear and danger in that, as I informed you in the chapter in which I mentioned the swellings that occur because of the artery and the vein.	The operation for these is to examine, and if the exomphalos be due to arterial or venous blood, or wind, you should withhold treatment since it is dangerous in these cases, with an uncertain outlook, as I taught you in the chapter on tumours arising from an artery or vein.	0.77772206
If an artery or vein obstructs you, tie it off quickly and return to your work. Take two needles, insert two strong threads into them, and insert the two needles, hardened, into the incision you made around the swelling, having passed them through.	And if you come across an artery or vein, tie it securely and go on with your work: take two needles and thread them with two strong threads and insert the two needles into the incision that you have made around the tumour, pushing them in so that they cross one another.	0.8385963
Then tighten the swelling in four places on the needles. If you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the pulled flesh rots and falls off by itself, or cut it when it becomes thin and rots.	Then ligature the tumour in four places over the needles. If you wish, you may remove the needles and let be until the ligatured tissue necroses and falls away of its own accord; or cut it away when it is thin and necrosing.	0.89645725
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments until it heals.	Then dress with the needful ointments until healed.	0.88909703
If the protrusion of the navel is from flesh growing in it or from moisture, then it is necessary to scrape out the swelling as we said, and remove the blood or moisture that you find in it, then treat it with what will heal the place.	But if the prominent navel be due to an overgrowth of flesh there or from humidity, you should slice the tumour as we have said and get out all the blood or humidity to be found there.	0.8025829
