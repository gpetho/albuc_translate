Chapter Twenty-Five.
On the reduction of the clavicle and tip of the shoulder.
As for the clavicle, it is not dislocated from the inner side because of its connection to the chest, but it may be dislocated outward, and that is apparent to the touch.  Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms.
Then you press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return. Then you apply a bandage and supports and tighten them. As for the end that is next to and connected to the shoulder, it is rarely dislocated. If it is ever dislocated, it should be reduced and straightened as we have described, and as you are able.
Then you put on it the bandage, supports, and tightening, and order the patient to remain still and at rest until he recovers.  With this same treatment, you reduce the tip of the shoulder if it also shifts from its place.
