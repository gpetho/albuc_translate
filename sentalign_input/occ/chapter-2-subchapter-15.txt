Chapter XV.
On the adhesion of the eyelid with the conjunctiva or the cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many men so that the upper eyelid is joined with the white of the eye, and its movement and natural functions are hindered, then you must insert the tip of a needle under the eyelid and lift it up, or extend it with a hook.
Then you cut the adhesion with a fine instrument, which should not have a sharp point, but be somewhat blunt so as not to disturb the patient during the operation, and remove the instrument without damaging the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision scrape away the adhesion easily until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and all the adhesion is healed.
Then put salty water in the eye and wash it; or drip into it fennel juice dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen cloth, and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white, and on the third day use consolidating treatments until it is healed.
