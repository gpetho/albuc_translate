On Cauterizing Bleeding that Occurs When an Artery is Severed.
Often bleeding occurs from an artery that has been severed during an external wound or during the incision of a tumor or the cauterization of a limb and so on, making it difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the opening of the artery and press firmly until you stop the blood flow beneath your finger so that nothing comes out.  Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, depending on the wound and the place where the artery ruptured, and place the cautery on the vessel itself after quickly removing your finger. Hold the cautery there until the bleeding stops.
If the blood gushes out when you lift your finger from the mouth of the artery and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire and continue doing this, one after another, until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve that may be there, which would cause the patient further harm. Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by severing it, if it has not already been severed.
For if it is severed, its ends contract, and the bleeding stops. Or it can be tied tightly with threads, or medications that stop bleeding can be applied to it, and it can be bandaged tightly.
As for those who try to stop it with a bandage or by tightening with rags or applying burning substances and the like, it will not stop at all, except rarely. If this happens to someone, and a doctor or medicine is not available, let him immediately place his index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
And he should press it very hard until the blood is contained and emerges from above the wound and the artery, and the finger should not be removed from it.  Continuously apply very cold water until the blood congeals, thickens, and stops flowing. During this time, consider what is needed in terms of cauterization or medication.
