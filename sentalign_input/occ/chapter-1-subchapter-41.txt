Chapter Forty-One:
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs in the hip area due to cold and humidity, and the patient is not cured by previous treatments, then the patient should be purged of thick humors with fetid pills or similar remedies; and then cauterize.
The method of cauterization can be of two types: cauterization with burning medicines or cauterization with fire.
There are two known methods, one of which involves cauterizing the hip area with three triangular cauterizations; and make them deep.
The space between each cauterization should be the width of a finger, and the cauteries should be olive or large.
Sometimes the cauterization should be on the middle spot on the hip joint, resulting in four cauterizations.
If you prefer, cauterize with a circular cautery as described for hip dislocation, ensuring it burns through the entire scab.
This is the method for cauterizing sciatica when the pain is in the hip and not extending into the thigh.
But if the pain extends into the thigh, then cauterize with two cauterizations on the thigh where the pain is located; and with one cauterization on the ankle, four fingers from the outer side.
If the cautery is knife-like, the depth should match the thickness of the scab.
If the pain extends to the toes, then cauterize at the point of pain with three or four cauterizations, or more if necessary.
If the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize there with one knife-like cautery.
Be careful in all cauterizations not to burn nerves or large arteries, as this can cause harm or contraction in the patient.
I have seen cases where cauterization on the ankle resulted in severe swelling extending to the foot, causing perforation and corruption of the entire foot.
This often led to severe diarrhea and eventually death.
If the pain is in two places simultaneously, cauterize each area in the same manner.
Some experts describe a hip cautery shaped like a circular iron, half a palm in circumference, with an opening the size of a date stone or slightly smaller.
Inside this circle, there is another third; the space between them is the size of a walnut; these circles are open on both sides; their length is one or two nuts; these are well-made iron rings; this is their form:
Then, heat in the fire until it is red and sparkles, and then place it on the hip area, with the patient lying on their healthy side.
Then cauterize with three round cauterizations at once.
Leave it for three days; then apply a poultice and leave the wound open for several days; and treat with ointments until healed.
Albucasis says: "Oh, sons, we rarely use this type of cauterization due to the fear of its effects and because few patients can withstand it."
But it is effective for those who endure it and locate the source of the pain.
Another type of cautery involves using two circles with perforated armules through which iron pins are inserted; their length should be two nuts or close to it.
The space between each should be the width of a finger; they should be open on the top and bottom, fitting together in this manner:
Place on the hip area, with the patient lying on the healthy side, and press your hand on the hip area; then pour hot water between the two circles, gradually heating it with a small fire, keeping it for an hour, and the patient should endure the biting and burning sensation — which feels like fire — until the biting stops.
Then remove your hand with the instrument and wash off the hot water from the entire hip area with fresh water.
Leave it for three days and apply a poultice until the burn's blackness disappears, leave it for a few days, and pus will drain; this is the final aid.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, use the same method as for the hip.
This is the hot water method, which I have already described in the treatise on medicine correction.
Prepare alkali and unslaked lime in equal parts, grind them and place them in a new pot with a small hole in the bottom, enough to fit a drop.
Place an enameled pot beneath the first, and pour fresh water over the alkali and lime to cover them by a finger's width, then press firmly with your hand, and let the water drip through the hole into the enameled pot below.
Collect this water, pour it over more fresh lime and alkali, making it very strong, useful in many medical operations and in cauterizing other body parts, as it acts like fire.
This is one of the medicines used for hip cauterization, such as vinegar and honey mixed with lime and soap.
Gualia recounts an ancient remedy and cure for hip and sciatic vein pain, highly praising it, saying it requires no other treatment, and that it heals in one application as he described, quickly entering the bath and emerging cured.
Take fresh rue, or if unavailable, fresh figs; crush them well with a bit of fat and place on the painful hip, thigh, or leg, and bind it.
Leave it for three hours or until the patient feels relief from the burning.
Then bathe the patient, and when the body is warm, expose it to the sun, as the pain will cease and healing will occur.
Be aware that cauterization with these medicines should only be used after body evacuation.
However, Escorides said that cauterizing the sciatic vein with goat fat is beneficial; do this by soaking wool in old oil, placing it between the foot's bones and the ankle.
Then take dry goat fat, burn it to charcoal, place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Repeat this process until the biting sensation reaches the hip, alleviating the pain.
This method of cauterization is called cow cautery.
