The heel bone may be slightly displaced. It may also be completely dislocated. Its dislocation can be either inwards or outwards.	The ankle is sometimes slightly displaced, sometimes fully dislocated, the dislocation being either internal or external.	0.8059853
The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, protruding towards the side to which it has been dislocated.	The sign of its dislocation is that you will see the ankle swollen, and projecting on the side to which it is dislocated.	0.9082071
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to reduce. This is done by gently extending it with the hands and straightening it until it returns (to its place).	As to the treatment of its displacement, the reduction of it is easy: if it is gently extended with the hands and straightened, it will go back.	0.77257884
As for its treatment if it is completely dislocated the patient should be seated and a strong assistant should hold him from behind his back at his waist.	As to treatment when it is dislocated completely, you should make the patient sit upright with a strong and sturdy assistant holding him about the middle from behind.	0.87847996
Then you take hold of his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below his foot at the ankle.	Then hold the dorsum of the foot with your right hand, and with the left grasp the foot from below about the heel.	0.84142876
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand then with your left hand twice.	Then draw the foot toward you with your right hand, then with the left, twice.	0.9614687
Then extend it with the left hand and push the dorsum of the foot with the right hand towards the leg without force, you do this twice as we have described.	Then extend it with the left hand and thrust the metatarsus with the right hand without violence toward the leg. Do this as we have described, twice.	0.84501445
Then push the dorsum of the foot to the leg on the third time while you pull at the ankle.	Then thrust the metatarsus toward the leg a third time while exerting traction at the heel.	0.8630128
If it returns (to its place) in one or two times in this manner and you see the foot leveled	If it goes back in one or two attempts thus, and you see the foot is straightened, well and good.	0.65411043
otherwise repeat the procedure, it will return.	If not, repeat the operation and it will go back.	0.80455995
If its return is prevented using what we have described then lay the patient on his back on the ground and plant a stake firmly in the ground so that it falls between his thighs, having wrapped cloths around it so that it does not harm the patient.	If you find it impossible to reduce it by what we have said, make the patient lie on his back on the ground and firmly fix in the ground between his thighs a stake wrapped in material so as not to hurt him.	0.86888516
Then an assistant secures his thigh. Then another assistant extends the leg either with his hands or with a strap that he ties to the ankle of the leg. Then each assistant extends opposite the extension of his companion, and the stake is standing between the patient's thighs, holding him so that his body is not pulled downwards during the extension.	Then an assistant should grasp his thigh and another assistant should extend the foot, either manually or with a cord tied round the narrow part of it; the assistants should pull one against another, with the stake upright between the patient's thighs holding him so that his body will not be dragged down with the extension.	0.90136623
Then the physician sets the dislocation with his hands and another assistant holds the healthy leg down. For the dislocation will return quickly.	Then the doctor should straighten out the dislocation with both hands, while another assistant holds down the sound leg; then the dislocation will speedily go back.	0.86877126
So when the dislocation returns and you are certain of its return, apply the bandage and the splint and tighten it with firm bandages and tie the foot with the bandage downwards.	Then when the dislocation is reduced and the soundness of the reduction is manifested to you, apply a plaster and packing, bandage firmly and bind the foot downwards.	0.81406105
It is necessary to avoid the tendon that is above the heel from behind so that the bandage is not tight on it and harms it.	You will have to be careful of the tendon above the ankle at the back, not to bandage tightly over it so as to injure it.	0.830029
Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it.	Then leave him for two or three days; and if the binding works loose, tighten it up.	0.9230401
Then release it on the third or fourth day. And the patient should refrain from walking for forty days. If he attempts to walk before this period, you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not recur and be ruined and will not accept treatment after that.	Then on the third or fourth day loosen it, but the patient is to abstain from walking for forty days, for if he tries to walk before this lapse of time you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not collapse and corruption set in and thereafter be incurable.	0.9205133
If he experiences a hot swelling, it is necessary to use in its soothing what we have previously described in another place of treatment and softening until it disappears.	If an abscess occur you must allay it by the application of such dressings and embrocations as we have already described more than once, until it is gone.	0.60124356
