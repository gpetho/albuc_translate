Â¶ On the Treatment of Hailstones of the Eyelids of the Eye.
Chapter IX.
Often something occurs on the eyelids that resembles a "Grando" in its hardness and strength, and because of this, it is named "Grando"; it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper or lower eyelid.
The procedure, therefore, is to examine if the Grando has emerged such that it is visible on the eyelid, and can move in every direction, in which case, the treatment is simple.
Make an incision across it horizontally.
Then peel it from all sides gently until it is removed.
Next, lift it with a hook and cut it out.
If you cannot fully prepare it for excision without cutting slightly into the eyelid, then it may cause some discomfort to the patient.
If the incision is large, then close it with a suture and care for it until it heals.
If it is small, no harm will come from it.
An ointment will restore it and help it to heal.
If the Grando is inclined inward toward the inner surface of the eyelid, then invert the eyelid, lift the Grando with a hook without needing to incise, and press it from all sides.
If the eyelid stretches due to the incision, it does not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the Grando with saltwater, and treat the area with something that promotes healing until the patient is cured.
