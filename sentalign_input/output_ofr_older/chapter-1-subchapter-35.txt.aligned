When you cut the "thelul", heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and then place it completely hot on the cut "thelul"; and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows; do this once or twice, and if there is a lot of "thelul", cauterize each as we have said; afterward treat with beneficial ointments until healed; and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the "thelul", it will be more helpful.	When you excise warts, heat a spike-shaped cautery and bring it, hot, to the site of the excised wart, and press down till the cautery reaches the mouth of the vessel whence the blood comes. Do this once or twice over. If the warts be more than one, sear each one separately as we have described ; then dress with suitable ointments till healed. And if you burn the patient with one big cauterization over the lumbar region that will add to the effect.	0.7999792
