On the method of cauterizing in the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter 16.
When the eyelid of the eye softens from disease or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery, using this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it slightly over both eyebrows with two cauteries on each side, distancing them from the temples. And let each cauteryâ€™s length match the length of the eyebrow, and do not press your hand down with the cautery; rather, only cauterize about a third of the eyelid.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this crescent-shaped cautery method.
