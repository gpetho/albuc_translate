On the treatment of corns, which are called "clau."
Know that "alamermar" is a corn, and it is nothing but a round knot resembling the color of the body and similar to the head of a nail, and it is formed on the whole body but mostly on the parts below the feet and the toes, and it causes pain in those areas.
Then you must incise around the corn, hold it with scissors or a hook, and remove it from its root; and then treat it.
And if you want, cauterize it as described in its chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, round prominence on the surface of the body, and often appears on children's hands.
And its treatment is to stretch and incise it, or to bind it with thread or skin until it falls off.
And if you want, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
And they are already eradicated both inverted and non-inverted with the instrument I will describe.
But "formica" is a small, felt-like or large fistulated prominence on the surface of the body, moving a lot in the flesh, and when it is touched, it feels like an ant bite, and it is formed around the body.
And its treatment is to take a tube made of goose feather or vulture feather, and make it strong, and place it over the "formica" so that it contains the circle of the tube around it; then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the "formica," and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the "formica" from its root.
And if you want, do this with a brass or iron tube in this way:
The upper part of the tube should be narrowed, closed (that is, not perforated), wrapped so that the handling of it with the finger is facilitated and its rotation is smooth.
And if you want, cauterize the "formica" as previously described in the chapter on cauterization of atheyl.
