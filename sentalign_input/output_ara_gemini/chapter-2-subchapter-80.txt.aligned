Chapter eighty on the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part (of the body).	CHAPTER EIGHTY. On the treatment of fistulae occurring in the lower parts.	0.82622683
Fistulas that occur in the lower part of the body are a thickening and hardening that occurs near the anus from the outside or in the perineum from one of the sides, and the fistula may be single or multiple.	Fistulae in the lower parts are a knotting and thickening of the tissues occurring externally near the anus or in the perineum to one side. A fistula may be single or multiple.	0.9139601
If this thickening becomes chronic, it opens and a watery white fluid or thin pus flows from it, and some of these fistulas may penetrate to the anus and to the intestine, and some may not be penetrating.	When a thickening of this kind has become chronic it opens and there flows out a white watery humidity or thin pus. These fistulae may be perforating into the rectum or bowel, or non-perforating.	0.8464661
The penetrating ones can be recognized by the feces and gas that come out of them when the patient defecates, and sometimes worms come out of them.	The former may be known by faeces or flatus coming out of them when the patient opens the bowel. Often also worms come out of them.	0.70789117
And some of these fistulas, if they are in the perineum, may penetrate to the bladder and to the urethra, and some of them may penetrate to the hip joint and to the coccyx.	Sometimes also there are fistulae occurring in the perineum which penetrate to the urinary bladder and to the urethra; and some also penetrate to the hip-joint and to the coccyx.	0.8009487
And what distinguishes a fistula penetrating to the anus from a non-penetrating one is that you insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe into the fistula, made of copper or iron if the fistula is not curved. If it is curved, then insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair into it until you feel the probe or the hair in your finger.	A fistula penetrating to the anus may also be distinguished from one not so penetrating by introducing the finger into the anus and a fine probe into the fistula, made of either bronze or iron, if there be no bend in the course of the fistula. But if the course of the fistula be tortuous, then introduce a thin leaden probe or a horse-hair, until you feel the probe or horse-hair come on to your finger.	0.9133791
If you do not feel it at all, and nothing of feces, gas, or worms comes out of the hole, as we have said, then know that it is not penetrating, so proceed with the treatment.	But if you do not feel it at all and if no faeces nor flatus nor worm come out of the opening, as we said, you may know it is not perforating; so hurry on with treatment.	0.8248577
And if the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urethra, the evidence for this is the exit of urine from it and its resistance to healing with medicines.	When the fistula penetrates to the bladder or the urinary passages it is signified by the passage of urine and by the fact that medical remedies cannot cure it.	0.74534535
And if it penetrates to the hip joint or to the coccyx, the sign of this is the arrival of the probe there, if there is no curvature to the bone, and the presence of pain in that area, and the constant discharge of pus from it, and that no treatment is effective on it, and it does not heal with ointment.	But if it penetrate to the hip-joint or coccyx, this will be signified by the probe's passing right through to there if it be a straight passage to the bone; and by the pain felt in that part; and by the chronic purulent discharge; and the fact that medical treatment does no good and ointment does not heal it.	0.8073528
All these penetrating fistulas are incurable, and their treatment is a futile effort for those ignorant doctors who attempt to treat them.	There is in these perforating sinuses no cure whatever; and their treatment is labour in vain for all the ignorant doctors who pretend that they understand them.	0.83224714
As for those that are not penetrating and not chronic, there is hope for their healing with iron, as I will describe and as I have experienced.	But there is hope in operative treatment for those that are not perforating and chronic, as I know from experience and shall now describe.	0.6891061
And they have said that it heals in some people rarely.	Yet some have said that it may be cured in certain cases, but rarely.	0.62263715
And among the treatments that are hoped to be beneficial is that you heat a thin cautery iron according to the width of the fistula, as mentioned before, and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches near the anus, then repeat it two or three times until you know that all the excess thickened flesh that resembles the tube of a bird's feather has been burned. Then treat it with wicks soaked in fat until the burned flesh comes out, then treat it with healing ointments. If it heals, then good, otherwise it will never heal with any other treatment.	The treatment from which some relief may be hoped is to heat a fine cautery corresponding to the width of the fistula, as we have said before, and pass this, hot, through the fistula to the anus; then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those compact tags of superfluous flesh, which resemble quills, are burnt away. Then dress with a pad soaked in oil until the burnt tissue comes away. Then treat with healing ointments and, if it heals, well and good. If not, it will never heal with any other treatment.	0.91038704
But if you insert the probe and it does not penetrate to your finger that is in the anus, and there is a thick barrier of flesh or peritoneum between it and the probe, and you see the fistula next to the surface of the skin, then incise the skin from the beginning of the fistula while you pass through the incision with the probe while it is in the fistula until you reach the incision where the tip of the probe ends, and the probe is released and falls out.	If you introduce the probe and it does not come through to your finger in the anus, and there be between your finger and the probe something firm interposing, either tissue or lining, and you see the fistula to be close under the skin, then cut open the skin at the origin of the fistula and continue your incision, with the probe in the fistula, until you come to the place where the tip of the probe has reached and the probe is freed and falls out.	0.8804645
Then clean out the thickened flesh that resembles the tube of a bird's feather, leaving nothing of it, then treat it with healing ointments until it heals.	Then clean out all the solid quill-like pieces of tissue and let none remain. Then treat with healing salve until healed.	0.78554684
If the bleeding overcomes you and prevents you from cutting that flesh, then the best thing you can do and the quickest benefit is to cauterize it with fire or with a strong medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two good things: burning that excess flesh, stopping the bleeding, and drying the moisture. Then treat it with wicks soaked in fat or powdered sulfur with oil until the area suppurates and the burned flesh comes out in the pus.	If the haemorrhage be too much for you and interferes with your operating when cutting away the tissues, then the best and most speedily efficacious thing you can do is to cauterize, either with fire or with caustics. For cauterizing with fire unites two good characteristics, the burning away of those superfluous tissues, and the stanching of the bleeding, as well as the drying-up of humidity. Then treat with a dressing soaked in butter, or sulphur pounded with oil, until the place putrefies and the burnt tissue comes away in the pus.	0.8791611
Then treat the wound with healing ointments that generate solid flesh, which are medicines that have astringency and dryness. For if it heals, it is cured, and do not fear recurrence.	Then treat the wound with salves to encourage healing and the growth of firm flesh, these remedies having also a styptic and drying quality. Then when the wound is healed over it is cured for good and there is no fear of a recurrence.	0.81759924
If the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the anus and search with it. If you feel the probe and there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh between you and it, and it is close to penetrating, then the action in it is only by way of hope and expectation, and that is to use one of three methods in it:	If the fistula reaches deep into the anus and is far from the surface of the body, then put your finger into the anus and palpate. If you feel a barrier of flesh or membrane interposed between the probe and your finger, and it be nearly through, then there is nothing to be done except to try a remote hope. There are three methods that you may employ.	0.915894
Either cauterize it as we have said,	The first is to cauterize it, as we have said.	0.6623374
or incise it until you reach its bottom to be able to insert the wicks and treatment closely, and do not go too far with the incision so as not to cut the muscle surrounding the anus, causing the patient to have involuntary defecation. Then treat it with what we have mentioned, and perhaps it will heal, as we have said,	Or you may cut it open until you reach the termination so as to be able to insert a dressing and bring the medicament into contact with it, but do not extend your incision too far lest you cut into the sphincter muscle and the patient become incontinent of faeces; then dress in the manner we have said and perhaps it may heal.	0.8326279
or penetrate that barrier and pierce it after incising it near the anus, as we have said, either with the probe or with another sharp-tipped instrument. Then clean all the thickened flesh in the incision as far as you can thoroughly. Then close the entire wound with the incision and the upper opening until it seals, and leave the fistula open inside the anus, so it will be easier for the patient.	Or you may perforate the barrier and pierce it through, after incising to the vicinity of the anus, as we have said, either with the probe or with some other sharp-pointed instrument; then clear away the fleshy granulations in the incision as far as you are able; then attempt the repair of the whole wound with the incision and the upper opening, until it heals. Let the inner end of the fistula remain open, for this will ease the patient.	0.9444629
And the fistula may be perforated in this manner: if you insert the probe into the fistula and it is on the side of the anus towards the surface of the body with the skin and the rim of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip like a cobbler's needle in this way: And insert into it a twisted thread of five threads or so. Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom.	Sometimes also a fistula is cut out in this way: namely, you pass a probe into the fistula; it should be near the circle of the junction of the outer skin with the anal mucosa; then take a probe with an eyed point like a shoemaker's needle; put into it a thread twisted of about five threads, and insert into the fistula until it reaches the end.	0.7966071
If it is perforated in the edge of the anus from inside nearby, then bring the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and bring out the end of the thread and gather both ends together and tighten them and leave it for a day or two.	If it has perforated through at the anal margin within, nearby, draw the thread out of that perforation by introducing your finger into the anus. Draw out the end of the thread and tie the two ends together and leave for one or two days.	0.94121075
Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the threads is cut and falls off.	As the thread cuts into the tissues, tighten it up well until those tissues enclosed in the thread are cut through and fall away.	0.8410182
Then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.	Then dress the wound until it be healed and sound.	0.85450494
If the opening of the fistula is not perforated, then perforate it however you can, unless it is very deep, then you should not do that because of the muscle, lest you cut it.	If the mouth of the fistula is not perforated, perforate it as best you can, unless the depth is too great; in which case you must not do so lest you cut the muscle.	0.90744615
Then do with it as we mentioned until it heals.	Then treat as we have said until it heals.	0.9418263
The image of the hooked scalpel with which fistulas are incised, its curvature is very sharp and the other side is not sharp so that you do not cut with it what is not needed, as you see.	Figure of the sharp-pointed scalpel for cutting open fistulae; the curved edge should be exceedingly sharp and the other blunt, lest you cut what should not be cut, as you see.	0.8081215
