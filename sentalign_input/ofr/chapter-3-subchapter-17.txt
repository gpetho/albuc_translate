Of the fracture of the bones of the foot.
At the ankle, there is no fracture, but in the bones of the foot there is sometimes a fracture, and rarely in the toes, and there is only shattering in most cases.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping each other, have the patient place his foot on the ground, as if he wanted to walk, and then immediately place your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press until they return to their place; then apply the plaster and padding on top, and place a small board with two flat ends under the arch of the foot, then bind it to the foot tightly, after you have wrapped cloths around it, and other things you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them as we have described for the fingers; then place a splint on the broken toe, along the length of the toe, and a little wider, then place the board that I mentioned under the foot, and bind it tightly; and if there are two or three, or more, broken, place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and tighten the board under the foot; and the end of the board should extend past the arch of the foot, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have said about other fractures, as we have explained; and treat each injury as appropriate.
