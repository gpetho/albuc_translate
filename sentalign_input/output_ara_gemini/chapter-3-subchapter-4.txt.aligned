Chapter four on the reduction of the lower jaw if it is broken	CHAPTER FOUR. On the repair of a broken lower jaw.	0.68526524
If the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, examine it. If the fracture is external only and not a double fracture and it is concave inward, then its diagnosis is easy. Thus, if the fracture is in the right fissure, you should insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the fracture is in the left fissure, you should insert the index finger of the right hand.  Gently lift the hump of the fracture outward from the inside, and with your other hand from outside the bone, control and align it.	When the lower jaw is broken and it is a fracture without an open wound, examine it. If it is merely an external fracture, not broken in two but sunken inwards, which is easily recognized, you should introduce the index of your left hand into the patient's mouth if it be a right-hand fracture; but your right index if it be a left-sided fracture; and with this, from within, push the concavity of the fracture gently outwards, with the other hand outside, regulating the correction.	0.9217868
If the fracture of the jaw is in two pieces, then extension should be applied from both sides in a straight line until you can align it.	If the break in the jaw be total, into two, traction must be employed, in a straight line on both sides, until it can be set.	0.8502008
If the teeth have become loose or separated, tie those that you hope will remain with gold, silver, or silk thread. Then, place cerate on the broken jaw, and place a folded cloth over it. On the cloth, place a large, tight splint or a piece of shoe leather equal to the length of the jaw. Then bandage it from above as it seems appropriate to you to bandage it and tie it so that it will not become loose. Order the patient to be quiet and still, and make his food soft broths.	If any of the teeth be loosened or broken away, bind those that you hope may be preserved with a gold or silver or silken ligature; then put wax upon the fractured mandible, and upon that a doubled dressing, and upon the dressing a large and strong splint or a piece of shoe-sole leather, the length of the jaw; then over that bandage in such wise as you conveniently can and as will conduce to drawing it together so as not to loosen. Bid the patient hold himself quiet and still, and let his food be soft broths.	0.8984012
If you think that something has changed in the shape in any way, then quickly undo it on the third day. Then repair what you bandaged with mill dust mixed with egg white or with semolina flour, after removing the cerate from it. Place a soft bandage on the dressing.	If you think there is any change of form at all, hasten to loosen it on the third day; then correct the change and apply a plaster of mill-dust and egg-white, or of white flour, after you have removed the wax from it, applying soft tow over the plaster.	0.88280934
As long as that dressing adheres to it and the condition of the bone has not changed, leave it and do not undo it until it heals and the fracture becomes firm. This fracture often becomes firm in three weeks.	So long as the plaster sticks on it and the bone undergoes no change of state, let it be and do not loosen until it heals and the fracture mends, for often a fracture of this kind mends in three weeks.	0.8977705
If a hot swelling occurs during that time, use what we have mentioned repeatedly to soothe it until the swelling subsides.	If during that time an effusion occurs, employ those means of allaying this that we have often mentioned, until the swelling subsides.	0.8348993
However, if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, examine it. If a fragment or fragments have separated from the bone, be gentle in extracting those fragments with whatever instrument you find appropriate.	If the fracture be with an open wound, examine it, and if one or more splinters have been detached from the bone, gently remove the pieces of splinter with any suitable instrument.	0.7625587
If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as much as you need.	If the opening of the wound be narrow, open it up with a scalpel as much as you need.	0.90928435
Then, when you have extracted those fragments and nothing of them remains, stitch the mouth of the wound if it is wide. Otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for it and join the wound until it heals.	When you have removed these pieces, letting no trace of them remain, suture the opening of the wound if it is wide; otherwise apply one of the ointments that are suitable for that purpose and will encourage the growth of flesh over the wound, until it heals.	0.86027664
