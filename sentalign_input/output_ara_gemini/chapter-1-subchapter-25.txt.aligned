Chapter Twenty-Five on Cauterizing the Armpit	CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE. On cauterization of the axilla.	0.7109052
If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to slippery humors, or it does not stabilize when it is reduced from its dislocation until it becomes habitual for it to be reduced and then dislocated at the slightest movement, as we have witnessed it, then the jaw should be reduced first. Then the patient lies on his back or on the healthy side. Then the skin inside the armpit is lifted upwards with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inwards.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated on account of the synovial fluid or when it does not remain in the correct position after the dislocation has been set, so that this becomes a regular occurrenceâ€”it is set and then dislocates with the least movement, as we have ourselves seen; you must first set the luxation, then make the patient lie down on his back or on his sound side; then with the fingers of the left hand lift up the skin of the axilla if the joint has dislocated downwards.	0.8807435
Then heat the cautery with two skewers, whose image is this:	Then heat a cautery provided with two spits in this manner.	0.72844684
Then the skin is cauterized with it until it penetrates to the other side. And the shape of the cauterization becomes four cauterizations.	Then with that burn through the fold of skin till you have perforated to the other side, getting four cauterizations.	0.7532486
And it may be cauterized with a cautery iron having three blades, so the shape of the cauterization then will be six cauterizations.	The cautery may be of three prongs and then the form of the cauterization will be six burns.	0.782766
And the blades should be of the thinness of a file.	The prongs should be of the fineness of a probe.	0.6732783
And this is a picture of the cautery iron with three blades:	This is the figure of the cautery with three prongs.	0.6816844
And one may be added to this number, making the cauterizations eight.	Sometimes there is added yet one more so there will be eight burns.	0.537676
Then the crushed colocynth is applied to the cauterization with salt. Then the patient must rest and not move the limb for a while until it strengthens.	Put on the burns leeks well pounded with salt; then keep the patient absolutely quiet so as not to move the joint for a time till it gains strength.	0.67704815
And if the dislocation is upwards, and this rarely happens, cauterize it above the shoulder with one good nail-shaped cauterization or many cauterizations by dripping/dotting.	If the dislocation has gone upwards, which very rarely happens, then cauterize him above the shoulder with one good claviform cautery or with multiple punctured cauterizations.	0.79707754
For the joint will strengthen, the moisture will go away, and the patient will recover.	Thus the joint will gain strength and the humidity will disappear and the patient will be cured.	0.8380325
