of the worms that arise between skin and flesh This disease is called in our land "ox disease", because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm that arises between skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body ascending and descending, and one feels it moving from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and comes out; and it is generated from the putrefaction of certain humors, as worms and snakes and earthworms and ascarids arise in the belly; and one fears its malice, for when it goes through the body, and it rises to the head, and it comes to the eye, perhaps it enters and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.	This complaint is called by us in some regions 'the cattle disease' since it frequently happens to cattle. It is in fact a small solitary worm generated between the skin and the flesh, that creeps all over the body, both up and down; it can be felt as it creeps from one part to another until it breaks out at a place where it can break through the skin, and out it comes. It arises from the putrefaction of certain humours as do worms, round-worms and gourd-worms in the abdomen. Part of the harm that may be expected of it is that when it creeps about the body and goes up to the head and reaches the eye it may make an opening in the eye and come out and destroy the eye; this frequently happens.	0.89021546
