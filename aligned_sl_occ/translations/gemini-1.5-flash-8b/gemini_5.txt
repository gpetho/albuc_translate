O, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, by its completion, its purpose is fulfilled, and through its expositions and declarations, it seems to me that I complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of operative medicine, that is, surgery.
For operative medicine is now, in our region and our time, completely hidden, so that the knowledge of it is greatly endangered, and its practice is restricted; and only some small descriptions remain in the books of the ancients, which have led to errors and hesitations, so that its understanding is clouded and its strength and art are lost.
And it seems to me that I will revive that [operative medicine] through the arrangement of this treatise, in accordance with a method of exposition, explanation, and abbreviation; and so that it will be understood through the forms of cautery tools and other instruments of the craft, with the addition of explanation and preparation for it, which is necessary.
But the reason why a skilled craftsman with his own hands is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive, and that its practitioner must first be practiced in the science of anatomy, which includes knowledge of the body parts and their forms, and the connection and separation of them; and must have knowledge of bones, nerves, ligaments, and their arrangement; and of the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their exit.
And therefore Hippocrates says that a name is a word, but little in practice, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already said this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not familiar with what we have said about anatomy, will inevitably fall into errors that will cause the death of men, as I have seen too many of them, for some are trained in this science and abandon it without knowledge and experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced physician cut into a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and cut some of the neck's arteries, so that a great deal of blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who attempted to remove a stone from a man who had suffered from it for many years.  The stone was large, and he managed to extract it, along with a piece of the bladder, which caused the man to die on the third day.
And I, having been called to treat that case, saw that because of the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I knew he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke in our land for surgery, and was called to a black knight who had a fractured thigh.  The physician, through his ignorance, treated the fracture by pulling it together with bandages and splints with excessive tightness, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he loosened it according to his desires, and then he reapplied it, and then he left it for a few days and ordered that they loosen the bandage.  And this continued until the thigh and foot became ulcerated and festering, and thus led to the man's demise.
And I was called to him, and I arranged to loosen the bandage, and this brought about tranquility and a lessening of his pains.
But meanwhile, decay had already set in within the limb, so that I could not halt it, and the corruption continued within the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who opened a cancerous abscess, and it festered for several days, until the severity of the disease was magnified with the patient's suffering.
Because cancerous growths are primarily caused by melancholic humors, it is not appropriate to remove them with total destruction, but rather to focus on the affected limb to the extent that such treatment is tolerable.
And therefore, children, it is necessary for you that the surgical procedure be divided into two parts: one part being the operation associated with healing, and the other part the procedure that carries significant risk in the most critical situations.
And I have already indicated this throughout this book, in the surgical procedures where there is error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to observe this and abandon that, so the errors do not find a way to speak and disgrace you.
Therefore, take your tools with diligence and God's protection, and treat your patients with skill and firmness.
And use the best methods, by God's grace, seeking health and praiseworthy success, and abandon those terrible illnesses of difficult healing, and remove from your tools anything that causes you fear, so that your reputation and your name may not be tarnished: for more remains for your glory, and higher in the world and behind your holiness.
Guaila already said in some of his teachings/instructions: Do not treat a serious illness, lest you be called bad doctors.
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
The division of the book begins, and first of the first part. The first chapter, ordered from head to foot, deals with the types of instruments and cauteries, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on cutting and piercing, cupping, poultices, and the extraction of arrows and similar things, all categorized and ordered by the types of instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting and similar injuries; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and concerning the types of instruments.
It is necessary for me to state the benefits of this cautery and its harms, and in which temperament cautery is prohibited.
Therefore, I say that the discourse on the nature of the benefits and harms of cautery is long, extensive, scientifically subtle, and secretly hidden; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they have disagreed about it, but a brief summary of their teachings will suffice to me, fearing to prolong the discussion.
And therefore I say that cautery is beneficial to all temperaments universally, whether with or without matter, except for two temperaments, which are hot temperaments without matter.
In a hot and dry temperament with matter, there is disagreement; for some have said that cautery is beneficial in that case, and others have said the opposite, that cautery is not suitable for an illness that is characterized by heat and dryness, for the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is inappropriate for a hot and dry illness to be treated with something that is also hot and dry.
And those who say the opposite argue that cautery provides benefit in all hot and dry illnesses that affect the human body, because when you compare the human body and its humours to the temperament of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I say, based on my own experience, that this has been revealed to me several times.
However, it is not appropriate for someone to offer an opinion on this who has not previously practiced and been educated in the chapter on cautery, and who does not understand the diverse temperaments of people, the nature of illnesses themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and the duration of these illnesses.
But in other temperaments, there is no cause for concern, especially in cold and moist illnesses, for all doctors agree on their treatment and are not divided on using cautery in these cases.
And understand, children, that the secret of curing with cautery using fire, and its beneficial effects, lies in the fact that fire is simple, its action only affects the part that is cauterized, and does not harm any other attached member except with little damage.
However, the action of a burning medicine spreads to the parts of the body distant from it, and readily causes difficult-to-heal illness and considerable harm in the diseased part.
But fire, due to its intensity and beneficial nature, does not do this except excessively. And this is already known to us through experience and a long study of the art, concerning the truth of causes.  Therefore, I am excused from a lengthy discourse.  If it were not that it is not written in my book in this part, the secrets concerning the use of fire, and the way it operates in the body and how it expels illnesses, would be demonstrated in a philosophical discourse, which would be more valuable to you.
And understand, children, that they disagree on the time when cautery is best performed, and they suggest the best time is spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at any time, because the harm from the accidental effects of time is outweighed by the benefit brought about by the cautery, especially if the cautery is needed for sharp, sudden pains, which cannot tolerate delay because the feared harm from the worsening condition is greater than any minor harm from the passage of time.
And this is not something you should take seriously, children.  The common people and foolish physicians believe that a disease cured by cautery is not always cured completely, and they believe that this is the consequence.
And the reason is not as they suppose.  Cautery is only a type of medicine that alters the constitution and dries up the moisture that causes the pain.
But nonetheless, cautery is superior to other medicines because of its potency, the effectiveness of its operation, and the great benefit of its use.
And it is possible that the illness may return at some point in time, depending on the patient's constitution, the location of the illness, the patient's strength, and the accumulation of excess fluids in the body, and what they have eaten and things similar to that; however, if the illness for which cautery is administered is a minor illness in a part of the body with few excess fluids and moisture, similar to toothache and similar cases, it is possible that the pain will not return, but this will take a little time.
And the common saying is that cautery is the last resort in medicine, and this is a true statement, not in the way they understand it, because they believe that there is no cure that is as beneficial as cautery.
And the truth is the opposite.  The idea that cautery is the last resort in medicine is only true when we've tried other methods of treatment for certain illnesses, and those other methods aren't effective; then, and only then, cautery is used as a final, effective treatment. Therefore, the statement that cautery is the last resort in medicine is not true, according to the understanding of the common people and many foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they didn't say this without reason; it's because of the equal and superior nature of gold's substance.
And they said that the cautery location doesn't make a difference, but that's not entirely true.  I've proven it; I've found that this only applies in some bodies, not all.  Cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they say; however, when you use gold cautery, it's not at all clear to you how much heat you are applying due to the gold's resistance to heat. It makes the area ready to receive the heat; if you increase the heat, the gold melts into the fire and some pieces of gold fall into the fire, and the craftsman is therefore harmed by this.
Therefore, cautery with iron is done more easily and more appropriately for the success of the procedure.
And I have organized this chapter on cautery according to topics, and I have organized those from head to feet, so that the reader can find what they need.
The first chapter.
This cauterization addresses dampness and coldness affecting the brain, the causes of which are twofold: one is the cause of excessive and numerous rheumatic fluxes, called "coriza," flowing from the head to the eye and ear areas; the other is excessive sleepiness, and toothaches, and throat pain, and generally all ailments arising from cold, including paralysis, stroke, and similar conditions.
The method of this cauterization is as follows: first, instruct the patient to be cleansed with laxative medicine, cleansing the head, for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and usual condition.
Then order him to shave his head, and afterwards, place him seated between your hands on a smooth bench, and let him place his hands on his feet.
And then, place the tip of your palm near the bridge of his nose, between his eyes. However, when the tip of your middle finger has reached the spot, mark that spot with a stylus, and then apply the olive-oil cautery, of which this is the form:
Then place that [cautery] on the spot marked with the stylus, in such a way that it descends, with which your hand is gradually tightened, and you rotate it.
Then lift your hand slightly and observe the spot, and if you see any significant amount of bone exposed, as much as a grain of corn, then raise your hand; and if not, return your hand with that iron, with another from that set, if it has cooled, until the bone is visible as I have told you.
Then take a little salt and dissolve it on the spot and leave it for three days.
Then place some cloth soaked in broth/broth-like liquid over it and leave it until the scab from the fire has been destroyed. Then treat the area with tetrafarmacon ointment until it is healed.
And if they say that while the wound remains open, the arm should be lifted higher, for it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the bone should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some part of the bone's substance is adhered to it.
Then scrape off whatever is adhering to the bone, and then treat it.
And others say that with the cautery they should get to the back of it, pressing forcefully onto the bone until it bursts, and this is the method of a small cautery. And they believe that from that place, the vapors from the head escape.
And let the wound be kept open for a long time, and then treated until it is healed.
However, I have not seen these two types of cautery in everyone, but only in some cases, out of fear; and in my view, it is better to use healing methods when they are; for the head is weakened by a breach in its continuity, just as we have seen in other parts of the body, especially when the patient's head is of a weak constitution.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; and with that method and practice, there is healing.
Second Chapter.
Concerning cautery of the head.
When chronic and long-lasting pain affects the entire head, in a prolonged illness, and remedies such as leeches, cupping, head purges, plasters, poultices, herbs, poultices, and similar treatments have been used, and especially if the head has already been cauterized with a cautery that has provided no benefit, then consider that if the patient's head is strong in its constitution and not weak, and finds itself with a very severe cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly below the previous one. And then cauterize the area above the patient's temples with the cautery until the pain is relieved. Cut open the affected area, and if bone is visible, cauterize that area with a cautery at the back of the head, in the place called the *vas* (or vessel) – which is where the cupping is applied. And be careful in doing this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience very severe pain different from the pain of other cauterizations on the head.
And I would say this cautery is in its proper place, for the cautery used for cauterizing the temples and the back of the head should be a finer cautery than the one used for cauterizing the middle of the head; and this is the method to follow.
Third Chapter.
Concerning the cauterization of non-chronic headaches.
When a persistent or spreading pain occurs in the head, or extends to the eyes, the head should be cleansed with medicaments, and the other treatments mentioned in my descriptions of illnesses should be administered; and if nothing works, then cauterization in that area can be done in two ways: either with a burning medicinal cautery, or with iron.
But the cautery with a burning medicinal substance is that you take a clove of garlic, peel and trim its ends from both sides. And then, you pierce the painful spot in the temple with a sharp lancet until a small cavity is created under the scalp, until it is hidden.
Then, press on it with a bandage to compress it firmly, and leave it for three hours; and then remove it and take away the garlic, and let the wound rest for two or three days, and then place a cloth soaked in vinegar there until the area heals.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the second treatise on burning medicines.
But the cauterization with iron, following this method:  heating by cautery, of which this is the form:
and it is called "clavus clavilus," because the head of it is shaped like a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small eminence.
And then place it on the painful area, and hold your hand—so that the surrounding tissue is not burned—and rotate the small iron bit by bit with speed.
And if the amount of tissue that is being burned, through the nature of the cautery, is, as it were, half of it, then lift your hand to avoid burning the underlying artery, so that blood does not flow.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; then place cotton moistened with butter, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the edge of the knife, according to the cautery method, and be careful not to cut an artery in this particular, not-old, migraine.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the cauterization of old migraines.
When you treat a migraine using the methods previously discussed, and the treatments outlined in the sections on illnesses, and the cure proves ineffective, and sometimes because the disease is too far gone, when the previous cauterizations with medicine or with fire fail, then you must heat the knife cautery until it is white-hot. Then apply it to the painful area, following a line whose length is half a finger, or a bit longer.  Then, apply your hand once and press firmly until you penetrate the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to damage the continuation of the jaw, which is strained by mastication, and that the tendon and nerves that move it are not injured and cause spasms.
And if it concerns the control and caution of the flow of blood from the cut artery, for in the cutting of it there is fear, especially for those who are ignorant of what they are doing and are not skilled or practiced; and they leave the operation unfinished at the beginning.
And I will come back to the treatment of accidental blood flow from the artery, according to its method, in its proper place in this book.
And if you see that this treatment is not sufficient for this illness, and you find the patient's condition tolerable, cauterize the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, apply the cautery mentioned in the chapter on arterial constriction with a two-bladed cautery; this is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter 5.
Of the cauterization of ear aches.
When pain in the ear comes from cold and is treated with laxatives and other treatments as described in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery, which is called a 'puncta,' and this is its form:
And then apply the cautery's point, and let the burning move around the entire ear in a circular motion, or along the affected area if the pain is localized. Move the cautery from the base of the ear slowly, after marking the spot with a probe.
And if the cautery is used to apply ten points to the whole ear, and cauterizes them, then treat the spots until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
Of the cauterization of tumors.
Tumors that are cured with cauterization are only of the types that come from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of tumor with leeches, purges, and remedies, and your treatment does not work, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the base of the ear, a second a little below the temple, and a third at the juncture of the two lips.
And place your cautery opposite the diseased part, for softening only comes to the part that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery at the right end of the ear, then slightly above the horn of the head; another one at the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the index finger; and keep your hand with the cautery until the quantity of half the thickness of the tumor is burned.
And this is the method of cauterization, and it is a type of surgical procedure, the method of which is described below. However, it is more subtle than that which you see; and it is necessary to cut away some of the superfluous thickness there.
And then treat the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Of cauterization for old apoplexy.
When apoplexy is old, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment isn't helping the patient, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize with four cauteries: on each corner of the head; and with cauteries on the middle part of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the jaw. And the method of cauterization is done according to what has been stated above.
And it has already been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is further back; and then it should be treated with what you proceed with.
Chapter 8.
Of cauterization for forgetfulness caused by flame.
There should be given to the patient at the beginning large jars and pills that cleanse the brain.
And then shave the patient's entire head and place on their forehead a poultice of the type described in the treatise on poultices.
And apply that several times, for that is a method of cauterization. And do this according to the same order that I have already mentioned.
And so, if that cures him, well and good; and if not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which descend from the most superior part of the head down to the lower part of the neck. And place the thickness of a finger between each cautery, and then treat the cautery with what was previously mentioned.
But if you [judge] the patient is capable of tolerating it, then make the cautery in the middle place; and if you deem [it needs] more application, then cauterize that area over the two [lateral] horns/bumps.
Then treat that until it is healed; and let the cautery be oiled according to the previously described method.
Chapter 9.
Of cauterization for paralysis and softening of the whole body.
You should proceed with cleansing the head with herbs and as we have said; then shave the patient's head, then cauterize the middle of the head with cautery, and with cautery on all the bumps/horns of the head, and with cautery on the back part of the head, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if the illness of softening of the body is severe and the patient is enduring it, and the illness is strong, then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and continuously with cautery until the spine is noticeably relaxed, and lift your hand. And then treat it until it is healed, and this should be olive oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless the epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
Therefore, it is necessary to treat the brain of the patient at the beginning of the illness, using herbs and other treatments as we have described in the division when the illness is severe and can tolerate the application of medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate medicine, then administer gargles and masticatories to treat the brain, before this for many days, with proper nourishment and diet.
Then, shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, in the manner previously described, and with another cautery on the back of the head, and cauterize on each side of the head. And if the illness is severe and can tolerate it, then cauterize it with the cauteries mentioned, having previously performed paralysis and softening of the body, over the spine of the neck and the spine of the back.
Let the cautery be olive-shaped, as was previously mentioned.
But if the patient is a child, then place a delicate cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
Of the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humidity and thick phlegm, then cauterize that with the cauteries which we have mentioned in the previous chapter on paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity descending into melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give him to drink what purifies his brain according to what has been previously stated in the division [of remedies].
And then shave the patient's head, and then carefully apply a properly made plaster to the scalp, and then place it in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright, and be held securely in all parts.
And then apply liniment; and an old sheep's fleece is even more suitable. And warm that over a moderate fire, to the degree that the patient can tolerate it being placed on them. And then apply that to the middle of their head, within the scalp, and leave it until it cools.
And do this with the patient once a week, along with the other treatment for them, until they are healed; or if you wish, cauterize that area making small punctures according to their tolerance, but hold a cautery instrument so arranged: this is a type of cautery which moistens the brain evenly.
And then place that cloth soaked in wool or henbane.
Chapter 12.
Of cauterization of descending water in the eye.
When you have recognized the beginning of water in the eye, according to the signs I have discussed in the division, then begin and give the patient a drink that will clear their head and protect them from all moisture.
And have him sweat in a bath for several days.
Then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head;  and then cauterize it with two cauteries on both temples if it is the beginning of a spreading water in both eyes, or with one cautery on one temple if it is the beginning of water in one eye.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin; and let the cauteries be in that length, in the width of the temples.
And be careful of blood flow when cauterizing; and if you see blood flowing from him, stop it with any medicine you can.
And I will come with knowledge which is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and caution in the stoppage of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck below two bones with two cauteries directly applied.
Chapter 13.
Of cauterization of old sores.
When sores on the eyelids are chronic and through the veins and arteries which are in the visible area of the forehead, and it is confirmed that this is caused by cold phlegmatic superfluity, then cauterize it with the cautery we described in the chapter on applying warm water to sores, and with a cautery in the middle of the forehead, and with two cauteries on the neck below the temples, and with two cauteries on the neck below the two bones. And if additional treatment is needed, then cauterize the area along the entire eyelid edge, along the eyebrow, with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Of cauterization of nasal foul odor.
When you treat it with what we've described in the division and your treatment doesn't work, then prepare and give the patient broth to drink for three nights; and afterward, shave his head and cauterize it with a middling cautery and an olive cautery. And then cauterize the area with a clove-shaped cautery, using two cauteries just above the two eyebrows below the hair, a small one.
And be careful of the sparks so that you do not set that on fire.
And this is the form of the clove-shaped cautery.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the cautery for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery with this lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you, cauterize a little on both eyebrows with two cauteries, on every part, and they should be elongated away from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the amount of eyebrow.
And do not press your hand with the cautery too hard, but according to the amount that the third part of the eyelid is adhered.
Chapter 16.
Of cautery of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs are turned inward and cause the eye to be inflamed.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inward, causing inflammation, cauterization in such cases is done in two ways, either with burning or with a burning medicine.
If with a burning cautery, instruct the patient beforehand to remove the hairs as those who groom them, until they are elongated and smoothed out; and if you cauterize them near their origin, then you should tightly bind the eyes with a bandage so that they are not irritated until the hairs have grown back.
Then, once the hairs have grown back and smoothed out, place the patient's head in your lap, and carefully apply a cautery to the eyelids, using a pointed tool shaped like a leaf of myrtle.  Start the mark near the hairs.
And then place cotton soaked in egg white or a ptilli mucilage over the eye.
And then apply the cautery, which has this shape.
And then cauterize the marked area, little by little, many times, until the surface of the skin, which is like a myrtle leaf, is completely burned.
A sign of successful treatment is that you see the eyelid contracted, and the hairs raised towards the puncture of the eye.
And then lift your hand and leave it for three days, and then place cotton with a bandage over it until the scab is removed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if any cause returns to the root of the hair and the eyelid is softened, then apply the cautery again just as you did before.
But if the hairs are under the eyelid, then cauterize them until they are raised to their natural position, and the wound is healed, and the hairs do not irritate the eye.
But the cautery with burning medicine—this is what you command the patient to do: to allow the hairs to grow out and heal, and then a leaf-shaped piece of cloth be made to resemble a myrtle leaf.
And then take known substances and living oil, or whatever that is, and mix them well, and do this quickly so it does not get cold; and then spread this mixture over the piece of cloth shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place this over the eye, or both eyes; and put a cloth soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head should be supported by you.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it a little, and do not remove it until the patient feels the medicine's burning sensation, for the burning sensation is like that of fire.
And so, when he perceives the burning sensation, then remove the medicine and wash it away with your finger;  when the burning stops, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then consider if the eyelid has been raised as it should be, having been treated with heat or incision; if so, it is well done; and if not, reapply the medicine to the place where it wasn't applied before, and don't stop until the wound has healed and the eye is sound.
And then apply a cloth with a bandage until the burn's inflammation is gone, and then treat it with a healing ointment or something similar until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, following your procedure, to carefully ensure that no medicine gets into the eye.  And if, after a few days, the eyelid becomes softened and some cause of inflammation appears in the eye, then reapply your medicine to the softened part of the eyelid, just as you did at the beginning, and continue until it is healed.
And this is the method of using myrtle leaves.
And know that human wounds vary in size and severity, and therefore your treatment should be adjusted accordingly.
And the path to recovery will not be hidden from whoever studies this art.
Chapter 17.
Of the cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of a wound.
When you treat a fistula using the methods discussed in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment isn't working, then you must cauterize it in this manner:  tell the patient to rest their head on your lap, and have an assistant hold the patient's head between your hands, ensuring the head isn't moved or agitated.
And then place a piece of lint soaked in egg white or a poultice of ptilli on the wound.
And then heat the cautery, which has this shape:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's wing, at the end where the cautery is applied.
And if you wish, it should be pointed at the other end. And if you want, it should be shaped like a probe.
But nevertheless, the concave one is better for your work.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and drain and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and remove the pus from it.
And then place the cautery, which is well-ignited, upon it, and hold your hand a short distance from the cautery from the nose area, so that neither your hand nor the patient is disturbed, and then place the cautery on the root of the wound and cauterize it.
And so, if at the beginning your cautery penetrates into the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then apply a poultice with a bandage and surround it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if more than ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply an acrid, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is smooth as appropriate to its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some earlier practitioners said:  Clean the area of the fistula and cauterize it, and then place into that fissure a small quantity of molten lead, which has this form:  And put into it the amount of one ounce of molten lead; and hold your hand firmly over it so the patient is not disturbed, as the molten lead won't enter the wound; and you should place on the wound a poultice soaked in egg white or water, for the lead will adhere to the fistula area and cure it with a remarkable healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about cauterization and treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a treatment through the nose and to return the fistula to its proper place in the nasal cavity.
Chapter 18.
Of the cauterization of a fissure (or cleft) of the pot (presumably a part of the body, not a cooking vessel).
Many times fissures occur in the lips, and especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have discussed in the divisions and your treatment is not effective, then apply a small, knife-like cautery in this form, as follows:
And its (the cautery's) concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then carefully place that heated cautery on those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat it with a plaster until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Of cauterization of fistulas in the mouth.
When an abscess forms at the root of the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, and a boil develops, and it bursts, and becomes chronic, and forms a fistula, and you treat it but it doesn't respond to treatment, then you should use a heated cautery according to the size of the opening in the fistula, and then place that heated cautery in the fistula's opening, and keep your hand there until the heated iron reaches the bottom of the fistula, and do this one or two times; and then treat it with the cure we previously mentioned until it is healed.
And so, if the diseased tissue is separated and healed, well and good; but if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone according to what is described in its appropriate chapter.
Chapter 20.
Of cauterization of the teeth and softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are decayed, and you treat them with remedies but there is no improvement, then place the patient's head on your lap, and then heat the cautery in the appropriate shape, so that you place the cannula on the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, and keep your hand there for a little while so the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times as desired.
And then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water and keep it there for an hour, then spit it out, for the decayed tooth is closed, the softened gums are strengthened, and the corrupted moisture is dried up.
Chapter 21.
Of the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is caused by cold, or there is cold or a worm within, or you do not consider medicinal treatment appropriate, then cauterization in that case is done in two ways: either with cow dung cautery or with fire cautery.
Cauterization with cow dung is that you take cow dung, boil it in an iron pot, then take a piece of cloth, wrap it around the end of a stick, dip that in the boiled dung, and quickly place it on the aching tooth until it cools.
And repeat this several times until the heat penetrates to the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cloth in the aforementioned dung, place that on the aching tooth, and hold a heated iron over it until the iron reaches the area of the tooth's cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is that you use a heated iron or bronze cannula, and it should be of sufficient thickness so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery to the desired shape, and place it on the tooth, holding it until the cautery cools; repeat this several times, as the pain may be relieved either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, during the cauterization, the patient fill their mouth with good dung and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the manner of the cauterization.
And cauterize whatever extremity you are able to.
And this is the method of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Of cauterization of extrophulos.
When extrophulos are of phlegm and cold humors, and are not yielding to digestion by medicines, and you desire a quick digestion of them, then you heat the cautery, shaped as follows: having two open ends so that smoke escapes from the cautery through one end, and place that heated cautery upon the abscess once, and again if necessary, until it reaches the base of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it on for three days and place a moistened cloth over it until that which the fire has burned is healed.
And then treat it with ointment, bandages, and dressings until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Of cauterization of hoarseness of voice and constriction of the throat.
When humidity affects the airways, especially when it's associated with a cold constitution, the patient should first be treated with laxative medicines, and then cauterized near the root of the throat in the affected area.
And be careful not to cauterize the throat itself or burn too deeply into the tissue.
And cauterize that area with another cautery near the junction of the neck at the back of the spine. And the cautery should be a sharp, pointed instrument, as described previously.
And then treat it with the previous remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning cauterization for lung ailments and coughs.
When coughs and lung ailments are caused by cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the ailment is chronic, then cauterize the patient with two cauteries on the collarbone, in the indented, distant and hollow regions; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and the cautery should be pointed, according to the previous method.
And if you wish, your cauterization can be performed by puncturing with the cautery known as "puncta," the method of which is described in the section on earache treatment.
And make punctures in these locations; and then treat it with the same methods previously described until it is healed.
And the cautery should have three prongs, because cauterization is performed with it: in one instance, you can make three cauterizations following this method:
Chapter 25.
Of cauterization of the "titillic," which is the head of the ailment.
When the head of the ailment is dislocated due to slippery humidity and is not held in place when returning from its dislocated position until it is properly in place, and then through a small movement it is dislocated again as expected, as we have witnessed, then you must first reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be turned over onto their back or on their side; and then lift the tendon that is in the internal part of the "titillic" towards the upper parts with your left hand if the joint is dislocated towards the interior parts.
And then heat the cautery, having two heads; and this is the form of it:
And then cauterize the tendon until it penetrates to the other side; and the form of cauterization will then be like that of four-headed cauteries.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place over the cautery some cooked salt, and then make the patient lie still, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done, then cauterize the muscle with a pointed cautery or with multiple pointed cauteries, for the joint is strengthened and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and excessive moisture enter the stomach, disrupting its complexion and multiplying there, and if you continue the healing methods and don't succeed, then the patient should lie on their back, extending their arms and legs, and then cauterize the area with three cauteries: one cautery under the foot, about the width of a finger, with a pointed cautery, and two cauteries under the two sides of the first cautery, until a triangular cautery shape is formed; and separate any parts that remain not joined, which will then be easier to remove.
And if the depth of the cautery is the equivalent of two-thirds the thickness of a finger.
And let the shape of the cautery be in this fashion without addition.  And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach in this form; and this should be a cautery in the shape of a circle, in this fashion:
And the stomach should be cauterized by puncturing it where the cautery has caused fright:  and you should prick the stomach according to the desired size with a probe, and then cauterize those punctures with the cautery; and then heal it with the previous treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the cauterization of a cold liver.
When pain in the liver arises from coldness, humidity, or excessive windiness, until its normal state is restored by the expulsion of excess, and the illness is treated as we have described and not otherwise, then it is necessary that the patient be laid supine on their chest, and prick three cauteries in this form and this same size onto the liver beneath the hypochondria, where a person lies.
And the space between each cautery should be the width of a finger, and the cauteries should be the length of a man's right forearm.
And do not hurry with the cautery.
And if the amount cauterized is the size of half a finger's width, and no more is applied, and if the patient is standing on their feet, and if they are not standing, then let them lie down, having spread their thighs, and raised their arms.
And you are able to cauterize these wounds with a knife cautery, when there is skill and prudence in your art.
And be careful not to proceed too quickly with the cauterization, and let the area the size of a finger be cauterized so that the entire body is cauterized and reaches the intestines, for the finger's width is delicate here; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of the perforation of a liver abscess with cautery.
When there is inflammation or an abscess in the liver, and you want to know if the abscess is in the liver tissue or in its covering, then if it is in the liver tissue, the patient experiences a heavy and sharp pain.
And if it is in the liver's covering, the pain is sharp and sometimes so severe that physicians have difficulty curing it.
Therefore, the patient must be laid on their side; then locate the site of the abscess with a probe; and then apply the cautery, which resembles a pointed rod, the shape of which is shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is burned away, until it reaches the underlying tissue, until it bleeds clear.
And then treat that as part of the treatment for the other abscesses until it is healed.
And only use this type of cautery if the practitioner has extensive study in the art of medicine, and if many illnesses have been treated with it; however, sometimes, inexperienced hands may be reckless in this operation, but that should be avoided by us, and it is better to refrain.
Chapter 29.
Of cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cautery of the roots of Aristolochia for pleurisy, applied in this manner, is effective.  Take a long, dry root of Aristolochia, a pointed one that is found, and it should be the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse that [root] in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize the area between the fork of the collarbone and the neck with a cautery.  Use two small cauteries slightly angled towards the lower part of the chin, and two cauteries at the angle between the fifth and sixth ribs, angled slightly back.  Use another cautery in the middle of the foot, one on the stomach, and three cauteries on the back.  Use one cautery on the area between the two shoulder blades and two cauteries on each side of the foot, below the one between the shoulder blades.
And it is not necessary to grip the cautery with your hand, rather let it be in a visible position, in use.
And some ancients said that some individuals use an iron cautery shaped like a ray, heat it, and place it on the area between the ribs until, using it, they reach the abscess and force out pus, as we have described in the abscess of the liver.
But this cautery perforation is not without risk, for you quickly cause a fistula in the area, one that does not heal.
Chapter 30.
Of the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat spleen disease using what we have described in the division of treatment, and your treatment doesn't work, then cauterization there is done in three ways, all of which are suitable; one is to make three or four linear cauteries along the length of the spleen, following the shape of the liver cauteries previously described.
And the distance between each cautery should be about the width of a finger or a little more, and the method of cauterization should be the same as that described for the liver cauterization.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and the patient should be lying on their back.
And another method of cauterization is to apply the cautery using two incisions, a procedure discussed in the chapter on muscle dislocations, and elevate the rib that is in the area of the spleen on the left side of the patient's body.
And your elevation of the rib should be along the length of the body, so that cauteries are made across the width of the body.
And then, quickly insert the two incisions (or points of cauterization) into the space where they will penetrate the rib on the other side.
And then remove the cautery; and thus four cauteries have been made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three incisions.
And now you treat the cautery, since it has stopped discharging pus for several days, because this is more important than the other preceding elements in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
Of the cauterization of dropsy.
Cautery is not applied to dropsy, but rather to a specific type of swelling.
When you treat dropsy with the methods of treatment we have described in the division and your treatment does not work, then it is necessary to cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, and two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, one cautery on the right side of the foot, and another on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the severity of the swelling.
And leave the cautery open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment near the cautery with whatever is necessary, so that two intentions are added to it, and its healing will be hastened by aid.
The shape of the cautery used to cauterize the abdomen should be wedge-shaped, following the shape of the one above it, and the one used to cauterize the back should be olive-shaped, following its preceding shape.
Chapter 32.
Of the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are swollen with dropsy and filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, in the area between the auricular and annular bones, and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; and then lift your hand, and do not fully return it, for the yellow water recedes.
The cautery should be shaped like this:  Then apply two cauteries to the two thighs, and on each thigh, cauterize with the blade-like end of the cautery. And let the cauteries be along the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and two cauteries on each thigh.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time, so that any remaining water drains from it.
And then treat it with those remedies we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
Of cauterization of the abdominal area.
When the abdominal area is affected by cold and dampness, impairing the digestive and retentive powers, located in the stomach and intestines, this is treated with the methods of cure and remedies, and sometimes the patient will tolerate cauterization, which will exhibit its virtue.  In such cases, cauterize the area with a large cautery on their stomach, as previously described for cauterization of the stomach, using a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries in the circle around the navel, a thin, nail-shaped cautery, and also using a large cautery on the abdominal wall, or two smaller ones.
And if sometimes the excessive moisture and the patient tolerate it, then cauterize the area around the groin and intestines, adjusting two cauteries firmly on the stomach and near the groin area, for this is a perfect cure for the benefit of which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
Of cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When there are old hemorrhoids that are in the nature of thick humors, cold or corrupted moisture, and they haven't been cured by what we have discussed in the division (of treatments) and your efforts have not been successful, then cauterize with three cauteries on the pus below the spine, one that is small and triangular, and with another cautery above the navel, placing it between two fingers.
And if you fear that their stomach is chilled and their food is not being digested, and their face often becomes inflamed, then cauterize the area on their stomach with a large cautery, as was previously mentioned; and with one cautery on the liver and another on their spleen using a wedge-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time and then treat until healed.
Chapter 35.
Of cauterization of the ailment near the removal of their (a diseased area).
When you remove the ailment, then you heat the cautery that is shaped like a ray. Then place that heated cautery on the removed ailment, and continue holding your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, for if the ailments are numerous, then cauterize each one of them according to what we have recounted, and afterwards treat them with the ointments you apply to them until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery over a wide area, it is more harmful in its effect.
Chapter 36.
Of the cauterization of fistulas that are present in the body's natural structures in those areas.
When nature does not respond to the procedure we have described in its proper place, and the patient is distressed by this, [the condition] should be treated with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in their body's natural structure, and it is old, with foul pus and corrupted moisture, then the most appropriate action is to probe it with a thin probe, and then determine the extent of its depth using the aforementioned probe.
Then heat the cautery, which resembles a rod. And then place that heated cautery into this fistula, to the depth to which you inserted the probe.
And repeat the application of the cautery until those corrupted tissues are burned, once, twice, or three times, depending on your necessity.
And be careful not to burn any nerves or veins; or if the fistula leads to the bladder or the bowel, then avoid those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy area and you think it is not deep-seated.
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the matter is removed from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is completely healed.
And if the matter is not removed from it, then know that it is deep-seated or in the proximity of diseased tissue, or that this comes from those causes from which memory will return to its place.
Chapter 37.
Of cauterization of the kidneys.
When the kidneys suffer pain due to cold or excessive windiness, and because of this, the patient's body is weakened, then it is necessary to cauterize that area on the kidneys with a pointed cautery instrument for each kidney, with a cautery from which the remembrance [or a specific location] should be extracted.
And then lightly cauterize a small area below, so that there will be three lines of cauterizations, and thus they will be more effective in alleviating the problem.
Chapter 38.
Of cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that area directly below the bladder, where the hair of the pubic region begins. Cauterize with one cautery on the right side, and with another on the left side.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the severity of the condition; and cauterize that with a cautery at the lowest part of the groin, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a pointed one, according to the procedure.
Chapter 39.
Of cauterization of the mother.
When cold and humidity affect the mother, and therefore pregnancy is prohibited, and her menstrual flow is corrupted, and its expulsion delayed, and pain precedes their occurrence, then the area should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have described for cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the spot just below the groin, or with two cauteries, and the cautery should be pointed.
Chapter 40.
Of cauterization of dislocation of the ankle.
When mucous humidity is spread to the ankle area, and causes its displacement from its proper place, and a sign of this is that the joint is elongated over the other when compared together. And the place of the dislocation is found where it is swollen.
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the ankle area with a circular cautery, after you have marked with a probe the outline of the affected area as it is twisted, and so that the area falls into the center of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the same form as in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize that area with three small, olive-shaped cauteries.
And let the cauterization be performed according to the severity of the entire injury; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
Of cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes to the area of the back, and it's caused by cold and dampness, if the illness is treated with what we have mentioned and is not alleviated, then it's necessary to clear the patient of the thick humors with foul-smelling pills or artificial ones, or similar; and then cauterize the area.
And the method of cauterization in that case is in two ways: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
There are two known methods, one of which is to cauterize the area of the patient's back with three triangular cauteries in this manner; and make a good depth with them. And the spaces between each cautery should be the width of a finger, whether the cauteries are olive-sized or large.
But sometimes the cautery is placed in the middle spot, at the top of the back, so there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle, the form of which is preceded in the cauterization of a dislocated back,  so that it's a continuous circle and burns the flesh all around the spinal column.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is attached to the back and does not extend down to the thigh.
But if it extends down to the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, over the spot where the pain is most intense on the patient; and with one cautery on the knee, about four finger widths away from the outer side.
And if the cautery is a knife, then the depth of the cauterization should be based on the thickness of the spinal column.
And if the patient feels the pain extending to the area near the toes, then cauterize there, where the pain is felt, using three or four points with a cautery, or more if necessary.
And if the patient feels pain below the knee near the thigh, then cauterize that area with a knife cautery.
And be careful in every cauterization that you do not burn any nerves or large blood vessels, and that thereby you do harm or cause contraction to the patient.
And I have already seen others who have cauterized near the ankle, and in the cauterization, the leg became swollen, so much that the swelling reached the foot, and the foot became perforated and corrupted. And then a severe bowel evacuation happened, and from that came death.
And if the pain is in two parts together, cauterize each one according to this method.
And some learned men say in cauterization, use a cautery of this kind: make it like a ring of iron, whose circumference is half a palm; and let its opening be according to the thickness of a date seed, or a little less.
And inside that ring, there is another third [ring]; and let the space between them be the amount of a pomegranate seed; and let those rings be open in two parts; and let the length of those pieces be one or two pomegranate seeds, and make on those iron pieces, well-fitted into the rings; and this is its shape:
Then heat it in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then place it on the affected area of the ailment, the patient lying on their side. And therefore cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
And then leave that for three days; then plaster it with a poultice and leave the wound open for many days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Says Albucasis: or, children, of this type of cautery we have used little because of the fear of its appearance, and because few have been found that look favorably upon it.
But of those cauteries that are endured by those who suffer them, and find the place of it by means of that.
But cautery with adhering medicines is when you make two circles, having a perforated instrument, in which you leave the guff/handle of the iron door, be the length of the wall, at the height where there are two nuts or keys there.
And if the spaces between each be the amount of the finger's thickness; and let them be open underneath and above, and let them contain themselves between each other in this form:
And then place the sick person lying on their right side, and place your hand over the affected area of the hip. Then take hot water and place it between the two circles, and gradually warm it with small fires, and keep it for about an hour, and let the patient endure the biting and burning of it – for this brings about biting as though by fire – until the biting ceases.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe the hot water from the entire hip with fresh water.
And then leave it for three days and apply a bandage over it until the blackness of the burn has subsided, and leave it for a few more days, and the skin will recover; this is a final treatment.
And then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain extends into the thigh or leg, apply a poultice to it containing water, in the same way as was done to the hip.
And this is the method of hot water treatment, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. A recipe for alkali and lime, taking equal parts of each.  Grind them and place them in a new pot, the bottom of which is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity required for the patient's wound.
And place another, unglazed pot beneath the bottom of the first pot.  Pour fresh, clear water over the alkali and lime through a fingertip-sized opening in the top pot.  Once you have thoroughly mixed them with your hand, allow the remaining, now potentially acidic, water in the bottom pot to drain away.
Then drain off all that water and pour it over more fresh lime and alkali.  For this mixture is now highly caustic, and is used in many medical procedures and cauterizations of other limbs, as it acts like fire.
And some medicines used for cauterization include, for example, terebinth, honey, and crushed lime with similar properties, mixed together.
And Galen recounts the procedure and treatment for a man from the past who was cured of pain in the groin and sciatic nerve, praising this method highly, and stating that it did not require further treatment, and that because it is cured by this one time treatment as it is documented, it is very easily applied in a bath, and one is immediately healed.
And it is to be taken of fresh green cerat (a type of herbal salve), and if green cerat is not available, take a fresh fig; and it is to be crushed with a little bit of rye and placed on the groin where the pain is, or the thigh, or the leg, and bandaged.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for as long as the patient experiences relief from the burning sensation.
And then put him in a bath, and once his body is warmed, immerse him in the ground, because the pain will cease and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with these treatments except after the body's evacuation.
But already Esquirdes (a physician) said that when a vein inflamed by a goat's horn is cauterized, it helps the patient greatly; and let the cautery be done in this way: take wool, soak it in old olive oil, and place it between the vein and the surrounding tissue on the foot.
Then take a dry goat's horn, and heat it with fire until it is burnt to charcoal; then place it on the wool and leave it until it is spread out. And repeat this, and do not stop doing this until the feeling of the bite reaches the marrow and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called "cautery of the veins.
Chapter 42.
Of cauterization for pain in two places.
Sometimes pain in the back comes from various causes, such as injury or blows or excessive discharge, and similar causes, due to the infusion of cold and damp material.
And cautery is only useful in this particular kind of pain, which is caused by the outflow of cold material.
Therefore, it is necessary to first remove the illness from the patient with pills and similar remedies, then make three lines of cauteries on the affected area of the back, each line being a width of the back, with five cauteries or more in each line, according to the patient's tolerance and the strength of the remedies.
And the cauterization should be performed with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a medial wedge-shaped cautery, following this method:
Chapter 43.
Of cauterization at the beginning of a swelling.
This illness often affects young children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it affects their posture, especially in the limbs, causing elevation and movement difficulties.
And you find that the lowermost vertebrae of the spine and the ribs are already beginning to protrude above the other vertebrae.
And therefore, when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a cautery that is circular in shape. that encompasses the entire vertebra.
And if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, two or three lines. And let the punctures be close together.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have mentioned.
But be careful that the cautery is not applied to a swelling caused by nerve spasm.
Chapter XLIV.
Of the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors which are spread throughout each member of the body, then when pain arises in the feet, it is customary for physicians to properly call this gout.
And therefore, when gout caused by cold humors is treated with other methods of healing and the pain persists, then relieve it with cauterization.
And you cauterize that area near the evacuation, around the joint of the foot, with many cauteries.
And let the cautery be of olive oil, of which this is the form of it:
And if it is necessary to make punctures on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries from every side using this olive oil cautery.
And if many cauteries are needed, then cauterize the area, but do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery beforehand, only to the extent of roughly the thickness of the cord.
And if the pain ascends to the knee and the hip, then administer the cautery which we have discussed in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called 'suagra', then puncture in a circle around the joints, as it twists, puncturing along those two lines.
And if there remain pains in the fingers, then puncture in the circle of the joints on each fingertip and on the wrist of the hand.
And if the pains reach the thighs or muscles after a few days, then cauterize them in all parts of the affected areas.
And you do not evacuate the illness with good regimen and receipt of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, it will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization of ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestines or hernia are protruding towards the groin, and this is starting to happen, then you must instruct the patient to abstain from eating on that day and to use soothing remedies so that the hernia descends from the abdomen.
And then support the patient between your hands over their abdomen, and instruct them to hold their breath until the hernia or intestines have completely emerged.
And then, gently return it with your fingers and apply a bandage to the rupture over the bone of the pubis, using a bandage whose end should be similar to a half-circle over the upper parts of the body.
And then apply the cautery, of which this is the form:
until it is very red and throws sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and then place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not come out again.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, and placed a cushion under them, another attendant is on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand holding the cautery straight, and hold it until you reach the bone of the shin/leg (or possibly the joint - depending on precise interpretation) in the middle of the thigh bone; and repeat with it another time if you have not reached the bone in the first attempt.
And carefully observe the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest the patient suffer death or other grave harm.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not complete.
And the cautery for children should be subtle, according to their size and proportions.
And then treat the cauterized area for three days with a bandage until the scar from the burn has healed.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for 40 days until the area and the wound are sealed.
And it is necessary to regulate the patient's diet according to the length of the healing time, so that it does not strain their stomach and cause the intestines to protrude.
And then, after approximately 40 days, administer a properly made bandage, and have them wear it for another 40 days.
And be wary of exertion, overeating, drinking, and loud noises, for by observing this regimen of healing, complete recovery will be achieved.
And I shall describe the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, and if, at the beginning, you want to prevent them from recurring, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and remove that portion which is protruding from the surrounding flesh, like one-third of it; then treat it with the methods already described, and do not deviate from them.
And some earlier practitioners might say that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, following this shape, after having been marked with a probe.
And a line is placed across the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and then you place your hand with a wedge-shaped cautery, but the first, simpler cautery is better/easier.
Chapter 46.
Of the cauterization of torsion.
When, in some limb, pain arises from a blow or a forceful impact and that pain persists for a long time, and medicinal cures are not proving effective, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And the cautery should be applied to each limb according to its size and smallness, its strength and weakness, the location of the torsion, and the pain in it.
Therefore, if the first cauterization heals, well and good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization; for it is the custom of those pains to spread from one limb to another nearby limb, so that those pains must be treated with cauterization until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Of cauterization of leprosy.
Some lepers are greatly helped by cauterization, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And therefore, when you wish to cauterize that person, consider if the leprosy is superficial and can be cured with what we have said in the division and not persistent, and you fear that the corruption will spread throughout the patient's entire body and constitution, then cauterize the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, a second below it, between the forehead and the hairline; and two more on the temples; and one at the back of the head, on the neck or nape.
And lastly, press the cautery slightly into the bone to create a small indentation, and from there, peel off the scabs so that the expulsion of thick vapors is eased; and cauterize the spleen as is necessary.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient and is evident, then you must cauterize them with those cauteries we have mentioned for the head; and with one cautery on the tip of the nose, and two on each cheekbone, and two on each vertebra of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the vertebrae near the hips, and one on the hips, and two on each hip joint, one on each hip joint, and two on the shins, and two on the muscles, and two on the tendons of the feet; and cauterize on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of their feet, and on the soles of their hands.
Be careful of the nerves that are near the heel so you do not burn them.
And sometimes, it is cauterized with one cautery on the hip bone, another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as they do from lancets, because the body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small, according to the limbs and joints, as dictated by the variety of instruments used.
And then treat the cautery with flour of eryngo mixed with honey and the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of cauterization for numbness.
When a limb is numb or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the skin slightly. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes numbness, affecting the hands and feet, and the vertebrae of the back and the nerves that supply that limb, is cauterized, and the numbness is removed.
But do not presume upon this unless you are knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the pathways of the nerves throughout the moving body.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the cauterization of whitlows (which is morphea).
When a whitlow is old and you cannot help it with any medicinal ointments, then you should cauterize over it with a cautery, pressing it slightly according to the extent of the whitlow's severity until the whiteness and its color are removed, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of rye and lentils mixed with roasted oil and arnica leaves, and with a portion of pigeon's blood or swallow's blood, all mixed together.  Then, apply a bandage to the area and keep it there until healed.
Chapter 50.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, in a circle.
And the learned say that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle; but I do not see this, for I fear it will ulcerate, and I have seen that happen several times.
And it is more proper that it be cauterized in a circle around it, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 51.
Of the cauterization of tumors.
When a tumor is delayed in maturation, and this is due to the excess causing it, or due to the patient's age, as they are old and frail, with little blood, or due to time, and you wish to hasten the tumor's maturation, then cauterize in a circle around it with many small, puncturing cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten in maturation.
But if you want to pierce it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and place it in the middle of the tumor until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in a deeper location, so that the arm's flesh is relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the cauterization of a corrosive (or, a corrosive condition).
A corrosive is a wandering corruption in a limb, which corrodes it as if with a fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if this corrosive is in a location suitable for cauterization with fire, then you use small, pointed cauteries, or larger ones, depending on the size of the area affected by the corrosive.
And then cauterize that area thoroughly until you eradicate all the corrosion and no trace of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and apply a dressing of oil mixed with herbs to the cauterized areas until all the scabs are gone and all the corruption is eliminated.
And then treat it with a healing ointment that promotes the growth of flesh.
But if after three days, healthy flesh grows where there was no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on the remaining damaged areas.
And sometimes, corrosive medicine is used as a substitute for cauterization. However, cauterization with fire is a more immediate remedy.
And I have already described the treatment with sharp medicine in the division, so use it when needed.
Chapter 53.
Concerning the cauterization of wounds and similar conditions.
Often in the parts below the sick foot, a disease called a “claw” occurs, a large, jagged wound that afflicts the foot.  Cauterization in such cases is done in two ways: with fire and with hot water.
However, cauterization with fire involves heating a concave cautery, somewhat like a small scoop, made of iron, proportionate to the size of the wound's entirety, and made of fine/thin metal.
Then, place that heated cautery on the wound, and carefully rotate your hand with the cautery in a circular motion around the wound until the cautery reaches the depth of the wound. And leave it there for three days until it begins to heal/discharge. Then, apply a poultice of crushed wild mallows with salt, and leave the poultice on it overnight, for this will eradicate the disease from its roots.
And then treat the area with a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if this doesn't work, and often this happens on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you should apply cauterization with water.  Take a cannula made of bronze, iron, or a bird's feather, and place it over the wound.  Pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, hold your hand steady, and rotate the cannula with pressure around the wound, pressing the cannula's edge into the root of the wound.  The hot water will penetrate the root of the wound.  Allow the patient to endure the hot water's effect for about an hour, then remove it, for the wound and its roots will be eradicated.
And do this with these [wounds] and then with the others until all those of their kind in the body are gone.
And then treat the pus, since the roots of the wounds are eradicated with this, with ointments which regenerate the flesh.
Chapter 44.
Of the cauterization of tremor.
When tremor is caused by cold in the nerve, or by a cold fever, or by another similar cause, then it is necessary for you to cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on the soles of their feet, and on their stomach, with an olive cautery.
And the tremor of the patient will subside, and hasten the recovery from the cold illness.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization of white spots/accidents on the body.
When white spots appear on the body, and pustules or fissures are formed from corrupted, thick matter; therefore, at the beginning when it first appears, it should be cauterized over the entire head of the fistula with a thin cautery with a myrtle stick, the end of which is heated; or with long roots of erestology; or with a lens-shaped cautery.
And sometimes, at the beginning of its expulsion, cauterization is applied in this manner; and if it is not believed (or trusted?), and the superfluity is broken up by doing these things, it is healed by these actions.
However, this should be done close to evacuation with bloodletting.
Chapter LVI.
Of cauterization of an accidental blood flow by archer's incision.
Often, an archer's incision leads to a flow of blood that is directed towards the wound, outwards, or towards the incision of abscesses or cauterization of a limb, and similar situations, and it is difficult to stop that flow.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, you should apply your hand to the opening of the archer's incision and place your index finger over it, pressing repeatedly until the flow of blood beneath your finger is stopped, and it no longer escapes.
And then place the small and large olive-shaped cauteries, many in number, in the fire, and blow on them until they are very hot.
Then, take one of those cauteries, small or large depending on the location and the wound where the artery is broken,  quickly placing it over that vein after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery until the blood is abated and constricted.
And if the blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the ones prepared in the fire, and continue doing this repeatedly until the blood is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is here, and that another harm does not come upon the patient.
And understand that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, except by one of four methods: either with cauterization as we have described, or with extraction if it has not already been extracted, for when it is extracted the patient's extremities are more likely to be burned and the blood is stopped, or by tying it with a ligature or a bandage, firmly tightened, or by placing medicines on it whose virtue is to constrict the blood; and these should be tightened with a compress with appropriate constriction.
However, whoever applies constriction using bandages or by applying burning substances, does not achieve success quickly.
But if this happens to someone and the physician is not present, nor any medicine, then, using the guiding finger on the opening of that vein as we described, apply great pressure until the blood is stopped from its source, and do not remove the finger from the artery; and over the artery, sprinkle with extremely cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened; and if there is a need for cauterization or medication, use that method.
Of incisions, perforations, cupping, phlebotomy, sores, and similar conditions.
We have already discussed in the first chapter every illness in which cauterization with fire, or with burning medicines, is appropriate, along with the occasions and causes for it, and the necessary instruments and forms of cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the supremacy of the head to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the seeker of this knowledge will be assisted regarding whatever they have inquired about.
And before I begin this, children, it is necessary to understand that this chapter is about the terror that is in the first chapter of cauterization.
And for this reason, great caution is required, for in the procedures described in this chapter, very often there is a discharge of blood, from which life depends, whether by incision of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of a fistula, or curing of a plague, or extraction of an arrow, or incision of a stone, and similar procedures. And all of those are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in their effects lies death.
And I warn you that this should not fall upon you, in which there is hesitation, for sometimes the ways of men with their many diseases come upon you. And some of them are angered by their illness, and death is near for them, both because of the severity of their illness and the length of their suffering, and with the illness comes fear, which signifies death.
And those are the ones who give you their possessions and say, "You are hoping for health," and their illness is harmful.
Therefore, you should not consent to those who come to you in this manner; and your caution should be greater than your greed and your rashness; and do not presume any cause for it without certain knowledge that verifies it for you, and for which a praiseworthy outcome will follow.
Use prognostication and indication of the path to health in the treatment of all your patients, for in that lies aid for you in gaining fame and memory, praise and glory.
Oh, children, may God inspire your understanding and not withhold direction and protection from you, for that is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by sections, as preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the treatment of the head to the feet, so that what you seek and need concerning this may be made easier for you.
First Chapter.
Of the treatment of water contained in the heads of children.
Know that this illness often occurs in children after birth and when the wet-nurse squeezes the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it arises from a hidden cause that is unknown.
However, I have seen this illness only in children; and all those whom I have seen died from it, and thus it seems to me a hopeless case in those.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always so swollen that he could not support himself due to the size of his head, and that the moisture grew until he died.
And this moisture is either collected between the spinal column and the bone, or collected below the bone on the spine.
When the operation in that case, if the moisture is between the spinal column and the bone and the abscess is small, then you should make an incision in the middle of the head, with a slit along its width, and the length of the slit should be about two inches, until the moisture flows out.  This is the method for a spatum.
And therefore, if the moisture is more extensive and the abscess larger, then there are two incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, a sign of that is that you see the seams of the head opened on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your hand in different spots, and this is not hidden from you. You should make an incision in the middle of the head with three slits in this manner:
And then extract all the moisture from the incision; then compress the slits with cloths and lint; then cover it with wine and oil until the fifth day, and then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with dressings and ointments, and bandage the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry foods with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, which considers where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the occipital area, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore, make the incision where the abscess and the accumulation of water appear, and do it in the way that seems best to you.
And be careful not to cut the artery, lest blood flow and the patient die from that blood loss with the evacuation of moisture.
Second Chapter.
When there is a persistent cold, or inflammation in the eyes or foot, and previous treatments with medicines have not worked, then the final cure in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you wish to incise those [arteries] that the sick person's ailment has affected their head, first rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and then secure the sick person's neck with a cloth; and then consider where the vein pulses; and [make] incisions on the areas that are near the ears of the affected person, as they are hidden in some men.
And then, probe the artery with a probe, and then incise each one with a sharp instrument (or scalpel) in each area, cutting right through to the bone, and this should be done according to the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the instrument under the artery and cut it through at the points above.
And the length of the incision should be approximately two fingers wide, for when any vein is incised, the blood flows out with a pulsating exit, which leaps out in frequent spurts.
But if the artery does not appear on the surface, then you must measure from the ear the quantity of three fingers' width, and then probe with a probe, and penetrate to the bone.
And the amount of blood that needs to be drawn is approximately one ounce, though it may be more or less, and all this is according to the apparent strength of the patient and the fullness of the artery.
And then consider the wound, and if any cause of suppuration remains on the bone, then separate that, so that a painful abscess does not develop later.
And then bind the wound with strips and bandages of linen, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Of the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
When someone experiences a recurring headache or sudden pain, due to acrid humors and a condition in the temples, or a severe, long-lasting headache resembling those, and is treated with the standard methods of medicine but finds no relief, then in these maladies we have proven effective the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or the cauterization of those arteries, as we have demonstrated.
And the method of the operation and extraction of those arteries is that the patient shaves the hair from the temples; and locate the artery visible in the temple because it is shown to you by its pulsation, and is hidden from but a few men due to the severity of the cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's neck should be tightened with a cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or apply hot water until the artery becomes clearly visible. And then you take the instrument, of which this is the shape: And then you gently scrape the temple with that instrument until you reach the artery; and then, you gently push on it, and extract that artery from its surrounding tissue until you free it from the membranes beneath, from all sides.
But if the artery is delicate, then wrap it with the tip of the instrument, and then carefully cut off a part in accordance with the amount that its ends need to be shortened or brought together, and no blood will flow, because if not cut, the blood will not fully recede.
And then drain the blood from one to three ounces.
And if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with strong double flax thread or long cord, and do not cut it before the wound heals, lest blood flow.
And then cut away the excess tissue that lies between the two ligaments; and do this at this time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery iron, or with a scalpel cautery, until the edges are cut, and it will remain in the same state as before.
And it is a better course of action if the patient does not have a fever or is not of a hot temperament; for cautery is among the things that aid in disposing of moist humors, and thus is better in youth.
And it is necessary, after the removal of the arteries, to fill the area with old cotton and place powders on it, and then to heal it with drying medicines that promote flesh growth, and with compresses, until it is healed.
And if, while working, a flow of blood from the artery occurs again, then you should attempt to stop the blood, either with cautery, or by filling the area with cotton and pressing your hand firmly until the bleeding stops. And if none of those things are available to you, then place your finger on the area until the blood has clotted, and apply water of intense coldness until the sharpness subsides, and it is firmly constricted as is needed.
And the easiest way to remove an artery is to cauterize the vein with this cautery, having two blades, after you have marked the two locations with a probe, and placing each, very hot, until they reach the bone and sever the vein in two places, so that the area between the extremities is lengthened, as it is not entirely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And the sharpness of the two blades be equal. However, if the sharpness is less than that of two blades, it is better, for if it is sharp like two blades, it approaches each part gently and does not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in those areas, the heat of the fire is held in them, and the flesh is cut/separated slightly.
And this method is better than any other method and more gentle.
And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of the finger.
Fourth Chapter.
Of the treatment of bodies afflicted with acute and acrid humors of the oils.
When the humors are acrid, and the vessels in the area above the head's forehead are affected, and you find no medical cause for treatment, and sometimes the patient's face begins to redden and feels like ants are crawling on their forehead, and the oils of the area are weakened, moist, so much so that their skin is visibly thin, and the eyelids are irritated by the acridity of the tears, the ancient masters in the treatment of such conditions, used a specific treatment, and called that treatment 'spassa'.
And you command the patient to shave the hairs on their forehead, and then make three evenly spaced incisions on the forehead along its length. And if the incision is two fingers long, the first incision should be the same distance from the nose as it is to the middle of the forehead, and the second should be slightly further along the line of the tear ducts, and the third the same distance from the other side.
And be careful not to injure the arteries that run along both sides, and keep your hand away from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space between each incision is the length of three fingers.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or very dry cloths with which to absorb the blood.
And then insert the spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of the incision: that is from the temple area to the second incision. Scrape away with that all the flesh that is between the two incisions, along with the periosteum (the membrane covering the bone), and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then remove this spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that along the flesh adjacent to the flesh, and the blunt edge against the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the feet.
But continue the incision along this portion of the flesh, and then do this in the middle fissure until the other fissure.
And when a large quantity of blood flows, squeeze the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place a piece of old cloth in each fissure, and place on those powders mixed with wine, oil, and vinegar, and make sure that a hot abscess does not develop.
And on the third day, loosen the ligament and administer a large infusion of warm or lukewarm water, and then treat it with basil ointment mixed with rose oil and other ingredients until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the treatment of sores (or ulcers) and descending wounds from parts within the head.
When a patient has sharp and persistent sores, and the wounds on the affected area are small and weakened, and the care for them is failing, and the eyelids are ulcerated and the surrounding skin is affected, and in the forehead there is a severe aching pain and consequent exhaustion, then understand from these symptoms that the matter and sores come from numerous internal veins.
And the best treatment in these cases is this:  tell the patient to lie down, and then make a small incision in the middle of their forehead, extending from the left temple to the right temple, until the bone is exposed.  (Begin the incision at the temple, working toward the other, and be careful not to damage the muscles involved in chewing).
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth, then fill the gap between the edges of the incision with old cloth or linen bandages. And then apply a powder mixed with wine and oil over the top to prevent a painful abscess from forming.
And when you see that the abscess has begun to subside, then you should cleanse the bone until new flesh begins to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes flesh growth.  For example, take two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, mix them, and make a plaster from this mixture.  Apply this plaster to these wounds to aid in flesh regeneration.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the treatment of what affects the ears.
Every ailment affecting the ears falls into one of four categories: either a mineral, or something like a mineral, such as iron or glass; or from a plant, such as a thorn or a bean; or from a liquid substance, like water, sour wine, or similar things; or an animal.
Therefore, if a stone or a similar substance that does not grow or adhere to the ear, is placed in the sunlight, and the stone is loosened, then apply some kind of violet or cedar oil to the ear.  Then, extract it, and make the person sneeze with a remedy, and then close their nostrils after the sneezing has occurred. Then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and stretch the ear in different directions, for often it is expelled by these methods.
And if it is not expelled, then administer extraction with a tool called a *gesti epicicarios* (a subtle, small surgical instrument), of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the instrument, good.  Otherwise, administer its extraction with a subtle, thin, small spoon.
And if it is still not expelled by that, then make a brass cannula and insert the end of the cannula into the hole in the ear, and seal around the cannula with softened wax and oil so that only the cannula is open. And then extract with a strong pulling motion, for often this works as we have described.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a heated cauldrons or a suitable device with which birds are caught, a small amount, and place it on the end of the wound, and then wrap it properly over that placed cloth. And then insert that into the ear's hole with ease, and then dry the ear of moisture.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then you should consider cutting it out before it becomes a painful abscess or spasm.
And the way to cut it is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to its virtue, and then make that incision between your hands and turn the ear towards the upper parts, and make a small incision at the base of the ear towards its fat, in the location firmly pressed by you. Let the incision be crescent-shaped until it reaches the stone, and once the stone is found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; then close the incision at that time quickly, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause of the affliction in the ear is one of the fats that grows and swells, then administer its cure and extraction; but if you do not obey this prescription, then you should take a subtle spatum in this way: And administer with that the excision of that fat which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it has already been softened by the ear's moisture, and break it into small pieces, and then extract them with tweezers or by skillful manipulation, or with an incision as we have said, for this will ease its extraction.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should use sneezing with caution at first, and fill their ear with some old cloth, and lie on their side with the affected ear down. If the water is thereby expelled, well and good; but if not, then take smooth, round stones the length of one's finger, and warm them slightly in the fire. The patient should insert one into the ear canal, and place a foot on that side, and strike the stone with another stone on the outside of the ear. So do not stop with the stone until all the water is expelled.
So do not stop with the stone until all the water is expelled. And when the water is expelled in this way, take a piece of paper or linen, put one end into the ear, and hold the other end in a fire until most of it is burned.
And put in more linen, and do this many times until all the water is expelled, and extract it with a tube, as described above concerning the stone used for extraction.
However, if a small creature, such as an insect or similar, has entered the ear, treat it as described in the section on the various kinds of ear maladies; but if it is a large creature causing an obvious obstruction, then remove it with forceps and hooks, and its removal is easier than any other thing that might be lodged in the ear.
But in the removal of a worm that has grown in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the section on ear problems and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not work, then you should expose the ear to sunlight.
And if any worm-like object is visible, then remove it with delicate forceps or hooks; but if no object is visible, then take a narrow-mouthed, wide-bellied tube, of which this is the shape: And insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; then, forcefully suck with it, repeating this many times, until all the worms have been removed.
But if it does not yield to this treatment, then seal the area around the tube with wax, as we have described; then administer distillations, which the ancients have already proven effective in treating worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your application be one in which you pour medicinal oils into the ear using this instrument, of which this is the form: Make it of silver or brass, narrow-ended, with a small hole and a flat top.
And thus it should push against whatever is in the cavity of the tube, continually, wherever necessary. And if you wish, take the reed and wrap its end properly with wool, then pour oil into the concavity of the instrument, or the juice of any herb, or whatever medicine you want into the tube—and that is in the ear—and then insert the reed with wool on top, and press it with your hand gently until the oil is expelled into the cavity of the instrument, and the patient feels the oil inside.
And whatever is put into the ear should be heated a little with fire. And be careful that the cause which you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
On the treatment of ear obstructions.
Sometimes children inherit this from their mothers' wombs, and it happens in some men too; obstruction in the ear canal due to a plague or flesh growing there; and this obstruction is sometimes in the membrane of the ear canal which does not allow hearing, and sometimes it is in the outer parts.
And that which occurs in the membrane of the ear, preventing hearing, is in the most difficult situations to heal.
And in that which allows hearing, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and observe it. And therefore, if obstruction appears, open it with a subtle instrument, of which this is the form:
If its tip, where the width is small, has one sharp edge and the other not; and the instrument have two pointed ends so as not to injure the ear.
And therefore, if the obstruction is due to flesh grown in the ear or in its passage, then remove it with delicate hooks, and cut away the flesh forcefully until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is in the front of the ear, then take a fine, pointed reed and heat it slightly with fire, and then place it in the ear canal.
And therefore, if you have detected obstruction causing the patient difficulty in hearing, gently relieve the pressure; and be careful not to harm the nerves of the ear.
And then place a cloth over the ear, fitting the size of the opening you have previously applied Egyptian ointment to; and do this for a few days until you are sure of the wound's healing, or that you take some and grind it with water and sprinkle it on the affected area, using it as a poultice; and if the ear appears to be already festering, then you must remove the poultice and replace it with another poultice wrapped in a cerate made with rose oil until the festering subsides; and then treat it until it heals.
However, if bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear, and use other treatments that constrict the flow of blood, as described in the treatise on bleeding.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the treatment of a swelling that forms on the eyelids.
Swellings that appear on the eyelids of the eyes sometimes are moist, sometimes are dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with forceps or tweezers, and cut them away from their roots with a knife, then apply a poultice to the affected areas.
But if pain with blood flow occurs, then you cauterize them with a fine, lens-shaped cautery.
And the best cauterization is done near the incisions, and the swellings often return if any cause remains from their roots; but when cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often, a cause resembling a swelling in its strength and hardness is found in the eyelids of the eyes, and for that reason it is called a swelling.
And it is a collection of thick moisture on the eyelid above and below.
Therefore, the operation for them is to consider whether the swelling arises from something visible on the eyelid and is spreading in every direction; and the cause of it is slight.
Therefore, make a slit over that along its width, and then cut it away from all sides easily until it gives way, and then suspend it with forceps and excise it.
And if the swelling is large, then you should close it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, then you will suffer no harm from it, because the ointment will restore it and make it flesh again.
And if the swelling is extending inwards from the eyelid's surface, then raise the eyelid, suspend the swelling with forceps, aside from any incision you might make, and press on it from all sides.  If the eyelid is opened by incision, this is of no consequence.
And after the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and treat the area with something that promotes healing until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the treatment of a boil on the eyelid above the eye.
A boil is a painful swelling that develops in the tissues of the eyelid above the eye, and it is more common in children, irritating the eyes of those affected and hindering their vision in the morning; and they cannot bear the light of the sun because of this, as tears accumulate in their eyes.
And because of this, you see them lying on their faces all the time, and they sleep on their faces; and the eyelids below their eyebrows are damp, having already been covered by swelling, and the presence of a boil is apparent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the boil in them.
And a method of treatment is that the patient rests their head on your lap, and you put a cloth on them and over that, make a circle, according to the size required to contain the boil on all sides, and then place this on top of it, and press it with your fingers, so that the boil is enclosed within the circle.  Then make a small incision in the center of this moistness, with a slit along the width, and the slit should not be larger than the one made in a lancing procedure.
However, in the process, you must cut through the skin completely until you reach the boil, for in most cases the boil spreads through a fissure, resembling a white pus.
Then extract it with cloths which you have wrapped between your fingers around the outside parts, and rotate it between your right and left hand until it is gone.
And be careful not to press too hard on the slit, so that with the incision you do not pierce the boil and damage it.
However, if the boil does not appear at the beginning of the incision, but you gently press on the fissure until the boil appears; then extract it as we have said; and then submerge cloths in warm water and vinegar and place them on the area and compress them with powders.
And some people sprinkle salt and place it in the cavity of the fissure to absorb any remaining moisture.
And then treat it until it is healed.
However, if there is a hot abscess in the area, then treat it with cooling plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Methods of treating the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes there are growths underneath the natural skin and they become inflamed, this affects the eye and causes various ailments such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids and tissue, eventually leading to the destruction of the eye, which is called an eye ailment (or tactus of the eye).  It is treated in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with a sharp medicine, as previously described in the chapter on cautery; or it is treated with incisions and sutures; or with probes, as I will explain.
And therefore you should place the patient's head on your lap; then gently hold the eyelid with your left hand, and if it is turned outwards, it is good; and if not, insert a needle into the part where the flesh is closest to the eyelid underneath,  and push the needle through with a thread above, right beside the edge of the eyelid where the eyelashes grow — close to the eyelashes —  and pull the thread outward with the eyelid, and turn the eyelid with the tool.
Then, using a sharp instrument (spatum) cut through the inflamed area within the eyelid, underneath the skin, from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller one; and then remove the thread and place small cotton or cloth powders under the eyelid. Then, bandage the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the bandage shape should correspond to the extent of the eyelid's swelling, as this varies from person to person. Some individuals require a larger portion of the eyelid to be incised depending on the degree of softening.
Then, using the spatula, make incisions along the two lines you have marked, starting from the larger lacrimal duct and extending to the smaller one. And if the incision is close to the natural eyelashes, just as wide as the king's finger.
Then, place a ligature at one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape the entire area.  Then, using thread, or fine wool, bring the two lips of the wound together.  Clean away the blood.  If you wish, use other substances to help the extra threads adhere to the two eyebrows; otherwise, don't worry about it.
And leave the stitches of thread in place for three or four days, then treat the wound.
And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is lifted by the sealing of the wound and its adhesion; however, stitching is better.  Thus, the ancients said this.
But nonetheless, be solicitous towards the patient, and this is good practice;  there should be no fear in you.
And there is another method in treating this, which is to shape a figure on the eyelid like a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three separate and joined hooks in this way:
But if this is not possible, holding the hooks, and this is not convenient, then take a needle with thread and place it in the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and adjust the threads equally between your fingers, and then with those raised fingers, lift the whole eyelid, which is marked as we described.
And then close the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if an abscess forms near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with plasters and similar remedies, and with ointments.
And sometimes, the lashes of the eyelid may need to be cut or removed, therefore you should use what we have discussed about incisions in that case, but stitching in each case is more skillful/artificial/refined.
To treat with canes is according to this method: and it is that you turn the eyelid and cut the figure within as I have recounted; and then, skillfully, make two thin canes or sticks, whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid and their width smaller than the width of the space. And you have already incised at the ends of each part, where you have the threads.
Then carefully attach each one to the excess eyelid tissue, and tightly bind the canes at each section. Leave it for a few days, for the flesh will die and wither because of the tightness and rot until it falls off on its own.
But if it has lingered, then break it with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Thus, when it is stitched, the eyelid is raised and the skin doesn't protrude.
And this is the method for two canes which you will make according to this form: and have a length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of raising protruding hairs in the wound with a needle when the skin is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough, and protruding hairs in the wounds, then the procedure for them is that you take a fine needle and place it on a fine silken thread, and then carefully adjust the ends of it so that each one is held very subtly. And the length of the threads should be about the length of a palm.
And then you should add another fine thread underneath it quickly, and use the ends of that one if you want.
And then place the patient's head on your lap, and be close to the light so that your work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
Then, carefully insert the needle into the root of the adhering hair, which requires skill, and quickly push it through the eyelid until you pull the hair out from above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair out completely and place it in the container, and there should be one, two, or three hairs, and no more.
Then, pull your hand with that until the hair is completely removed from the eyelid with the natural hair.
However, if the container is pulled but the hair is not removed, you will pull the container in different directions with the liquid you have prepared, until the container is removed from the hole completely.
And you will observe this with the eye's sight, for then you will remove the container and the liquid, and each person will cleanse and close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and healthy flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you should attach a longer hair from the natural ones, and lift with that, or you can leave it until it is lengthened by a small amount, and then lift it.
Chapter 13.
Of the treatment of a wound that occurs on the upper eyelid.
When a wound occurs in the eye, and there is a tightening of the eyelid, whether on the upper, right, or left side, due to poor healing from a wound, incision, or cauterization, and it is called "leporine," this wound, or ulcer, is either natural or accidental, and is caused by poor healing from a wound, incision, or cauterization, or similar ill-treated injuries.
The method of treatment in this case is to cut through the affected area of scar tissue, separate its edges, and place a piece of linen cloth between them, and bind them together until healed.
And you should not use treatments that dry or constrict, for if you do this, the wound will return worse than it ever was before.
Use remedies that soften, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice of water in which marshmallow and linseed are soaked, or a diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil.  Dip the cloth into the mixture, and treat with that.
And the key to your treatment is that you should perforate any part that is not healed to the original form.
And this operation, which we have described, is nothing other than a correction of the wound that does not restore the area to its original form.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of a wound that is located on the lower eyelid.
This wound on the lower eyelid, properly called a wound, may be either natural or accidental.
However, an accidental wound is caused by a blow, a cut, cautery, or similar causes.
And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it pass from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
And then gently pull the flesh apart with the needle, and stitch it together with the needle, and cut away excess flesh with a broad scalpel. And then, if the eyelid returns to its proper form, it is good; and if not, take the thread and place it in the slit, and with that close the eyelid, and close the two slits at the edge of the lower eyelid.
And let the extremities of the two slits of the incision be two angles that meet, and let their joining form an angle so that when they meet, they form a figure from their meeting.
And this figure is the Greek letter: Lambda.
And then, remove the flesh to the extent that the edge of the wound beneath the eyelid is sharp.
And then, bring together the separated parts and stitch them with a wool thread; and then treat them with the softening medicines and poultices mentioned previously until healed.
And if, instead, a cut or stitch or cautery is required, then you should make a flat incision on the eyelid skin, as described earlier. And then separate with a poultice between the two lips, as previously described.
In summary, the treatment for a protrusion, whether above or below, should follow the operation, according to the type of protrusion, which presents various forms.
And the skilled artisan always prepares instruments in every possible way until the figure returns to its natural form, or close to it, and the patient, according to what is appropriate for them, is prepared for the operation and the instruments in the best positions.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in such a way that the eyelid is firmly attached to the white of the eye, preventing its natural movement and function, then you should introduce the tip of a probe underneath the eyelid, and elevate or extend it with forceps.
And then you carefully cut the adhesion with a sharp but not excessively sharp instrument, to avoid unsettling the patient during the procedure, and then remove the instrument so that it does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And your incision should cut through the adhesion easily until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the entire adhesion is healed.
And then you apply salt water to the eye, with which you wash it; or, alternatively, a decoction of chamomile dissolved in water.
And then, gently separate the eyelid from the eye, and place wool soaked in egg white over the eye.  Then, on the third day, use healing remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of incision of the nail and the protrusion of flesh from the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two types:  either nervous, and resembling a hard, fine chip; or non-nervous, resembling frozen white moisture, which when touched by an iron, or forcibly taken with forceps, is detached and the forceps do not become embedded in it.
And both of these types arise from the major tear duct, gradually growing to cover the eye and obstructing the light and movement of the eye.
But the method of operating on the incision is that the patient places their head on your lap, then open their eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand, and then use forceps with little bending, and pull the nail away from the surrounding tissue. Then take a needle, thread it with a horse, ox, cow, or similar hair, or strong thread, gradually increase the tension on the needle, insert it into the nail, and pierce the nail with the needle, tie the nail with the thread, and pull the nail away from the surrounding tissue, scraping the nail bed with the hair, which is covering the pupil. And thus you pull it (the nail) with the thread to the back of it.
Then you cut the remaining part at the root of the tear duct with a thin scalpel or small forceps, and leave the natural tear duct tissue intact, so that the incision does not cause continuous tears.
And sometimes the nail, using only forceps or thread, as we have said, is then scraped with a lion's tooth scalpel, of which this is the form:
And be careful not to touch the cornea with the scalpel, lest it be damaged, and the pupil be pierced.
Then place a little powdered salt or a prepared astringent into the wound, and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with whatever is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle, or it is not embedded in the flesh with forceps, then frequently this type of nail is treated with medications, and is healed accordingly as I have recounted in the division.
And if you wish to incise it, then you open the patient's wound and take a sharp, fine lion's tooth scalpel, shaped like this: with subtlety. And if it is often thin, and inflamed, and spreads to the surrounding area, then apply a preparation from your pharmacy (or something made from a similar substance), or with red-hot cautery or with powdered salt, and cover the wound until the next day.
And then repeat the operation until all of that which is there from it is removed, unless a suppurating boil appears in the wound; in that case, leave it alone, and treat the boil initially until it heals.
And then repeat your operation on it with care until it is healed.
If the tear gland protrudes significantly into the wound, it should be suspended with a thread; cut a portion of it off, but do not completely sever it to prevent a flow of tears.
And then apply a red-hot cautery, or something similar, to the tear duct until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the incision of a boil and what is born from adhered flesh in the wound.
Sometimes, in some wounds, red flesh grows and overspreads the pupil, or it approaches or presses upon the eyelids, forcibly squeezing the eyelids together at the edges, resembling the rough surface of a balustrade.
However, the procedure for this requires the patient to rest their head on your knee; then, open the wounds and collect all that flesh with suitable forceps or tweezers, and hold it with a pair of forceps. Then, you should carefully cut through the flesh with the scalpel until it is fully finished, and be careful not to damage the wound during your work.
And your incision should be made with the same technique as when you incised the nail, or with small forceps, gathering the material as described in this section's procedures for this type of wound.
So, once your incision is complete and all the flesh has been removed, then fill the wound with coarse salt, or apply a red, corrosive-like powder, and place a bandage made of cloth and egg white over the wound to prevent further inflammation.
And if any pus remains and there's a risk of inflammation, leave the wound and treat that inflammation with something that will resolve it, and then repeat the operation until it is healed.  Similarly, do the same for any adhered flesh that occurs in a wound of this type.
However, you should avoid any treatment of the wound through natural or accidental means using iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that the limb can withstand the operation.
Chapter 18.
Of the collection of pus from the wound.
Pus that has formed, red, hard lumps over the wound, and prevents the healing process, and delays the healing of the wound by days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the wound in which there is pus is strong and there is no other illness besides pus, then you collect that pus.
And you command the patient to rest their head on your lap, and then to suspend those veins with an ounce or two, according to your judgment; and that ounce be of a fine, double-folded type in this manner:
or two ounces gradually in one piece in this manner:
And then carefully collect those veins with gentle force, and wipe the blood away bit by bit until you see those veins drawn away from the wound and curled up.
And be careful that you do not damage the wound with the edges of the spatula; and if you perform your operation in the middle of the day before the sun, and be very firm in your operation so that you only cut the veins.
And when you have finished, then you distill green or red vinegar into the wound so that with its sharpness it corrodes that which remains of the clot.
But if this is not possible for you to collect at that time, then you should plaster everything with whatever relieves his pain, and leave him for a few days until the pain subsides and you are certain of a warm abscess.
And then repeat this procedure according to the same method until he is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Of the reduction of arizati (or foreign body) in the nose.
When you treat a foreign body with a cautery or a sharp burning medicine, according to the narrative of the case, and it is not cured, then there is no use in remaining there; instead, cut open the abscess, once it is mature, and remove all the moisture and pus until the bone is exposed.
And therefore, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is called a sharp head, and it is made of hard iron, and the head is round, like a knob, which is made pointed by the piercing of a file or pumice stone through subtle piercing (as is in the following figure).
And place that upon the corrupted part of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and gently press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this is done several times, and then restore the area with drying and astringent substances.
Therefore, if the area is consolidated and good flesh has grown there, and the body is free from pus and remains for 40 days, and it is not renewed and not suppurated and no accident occurs there, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then it is not a true healing, but reduce the fracture to the shape of the nose, and in this way:  you must expose the second bone with iron or sharp medicine, and once the bone is exposed, then you take a sliver (or strip) in this form:
Let the end of the iron be triangular, and the shaft be thin and tapered to the tip, like this.
Then place that (the iron/sliver) on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal bone; and move your hand slightly from the hole, and then rotate your hand with the sliver until it penetrates the entire bone, and the patient will feel air escaping when he feels your hand.
Therefore, then restore the area with astringent, drying medicines, as you have been taught.
So, when the flesh grows and the area hardens, then the matter which had spread outward returns to the nose, and thus it is easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of the reduction of the eminence of the hole/opening.
When the opening protrudes completely and you do not encounter any harmful or diminishing swelling, then you should release the patient, and then follow them, and then apply leeches to the neck without incision, and obtain good suction.  Then, apply a liniment made of acatra, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla to the opening, and then firmly bandage the poultice over the opening with many powders.
And the method for the powders is to take fine linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded in four; and make many of those.
And then place those one upon another according to the quantity the opening needs. And then bind them together with a strong, hard cloth; and repeat the leech application with suction without incision; and then remove the leeches and leave the opening constricted day and night.
But if meanwhile the swelling is softened, then it should be very tight.
And then remove the bandage day and night as we have said.
And if the opening has already been reduced, good; and if not, then repeat the poultice with the powders, and the constriction and the leeches until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the uvea tunic.
When a rupture occurs in the uvea tunic, and it is prominent and protrudes beyond the eyelids like a cluster of grapes, and the shape of a man is deformed because of it, and you want to incise it, then the operation there is as we have recounted: you insert a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part, and then insert another needle with a double thread from the lacrimal side, and push that in and withdraw the first needle according to its placement. Then, cut the place where the double thread is and remove the part of the uvea in the area around the needle, and firmly hold that area.
And then withdraw the needle and place over the opening wool soaked in egg white and let it remain until the thread with the grape-like protrusion comes away.
And then treat the wound with something that strengthens it until the ulcer is healed.
And sometimes, gather the area around with a cloth circle, to hold a large protruding wound, and if it has been perforated with a thin spatula that reaches the edge of the wound, and the albuminous moisture comes out, the wound will descend and close quickly.
And then hold it firmly until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of  falconers (or, perhaps more literally, "birds of prey").
This ailment, called "alconati," is nothing but a suppuration that has collected in the wound, resembling descending water, but is not the same.
But the method of treatment is that you should have the patient sit on a prepared and straight-backed chair, and then take their head in your hands at two points and hold it thus until you see the pus coming to the lower parts, and then let it dry and not descend, and stop the light, and the patient should see the causes this way.
And if it does not descend further, know that it is water (or, perhaps, a watery substance).
But if the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then have the patient sit between your hands, and then take a fine, light-colored substance, and apply it over the panniculus, dabbing a little near the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the corona (into the hollow place), until the pus is expelled.
Therefore, when it is expelled, then you instill warm water into the wound, in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of water descending from the eye.
We have already discussed the types of water in the division, and which ones are appropriate to pierce with a lance, declaring the condition, then according to the health of the patient.
Then you should place the patient between your hands on a bed, and tightly bind their eye socket.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of their affected eye, if the eye with the water is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right eye.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is the left one; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Then place the almond's tip near the brow, along the width of the ray (or beam) on the white part of the eye, closer to the smaller tear duct, and then gently press the almond, and rotate your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has reached the empty space (or cavity).
And it is necessary that the distance of the almond's path to the point be the measure of the space between the pupil and the edge of the dark part, which is the brow of the eye; for you will see through that pupil with the eye's vision, by the clarity of the cornea.
And then place the almond into the area where the fluid is, and pull it down repeatedly, and if the fluid descends immediately, then you will see the patient's gaze turn towards it and the almond in their eye.
And then rest a little while; if the fluid has descended, then you rest it again before the almond is thrown out.
And then, when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond with ease, and gently move your hand around it, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in the fluid and wash the inside of the eye with it; and then apply a cloth or stopper or wool infused in warmed oil and egg white, and bind the eye with this.
But we and those of our time use a bruised (or crushed) compress with egg white on this.
And if you cannot get your almond into the eye's interior due to its hardness—for in some people, the eye is very hard—then it is necessary to take the preparation called "alberid," of which this is the form:
And therefore, pierce the conjunctiva with this, and do not press your hand into the hole, but merely make a subtle passageway for the almond.
And then introduce the almond, as we have said.
And to complete your work, prepare the patient's sleeping quarters properly, where they sleep on their back in a dark room, and prohibit all movement.
And place this on their body so that their nature may be soothed, and do not allow their head to turn to either the right or left at all.
And let the ligament remain according to its disposition until the third day.
And then, remove that from the dark room, and shield the patient's vision, and show them some things, and then return the bandage by the seventh day.
And you should not do this during the time of the treatments or immediately after the infusion. Having done this, you should remove it because the water can easily cause great and vehement damage from watching (or observing).
But if an acute abscess occurs, then you should remove the dressing before the seventh day, and treat it with something that will resolve the abscess.
Then you blindfold the patient and place something over their face through which their gaze is controlled from below for several days, while the patient remains in the darkened room.
And then gradually they are released from that room and guided back to their normal activities.
And know that in a serious case, the student is not excused from watching several times, and then you will be skilled in the procedure.
And it has come to our knowledge from some of those who are at Artach, and some said that a fire was made in the Ayrac, a large hole having been pierced through which the water was drawn out.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has accomplished this, nor have I read it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the types of magdaam so that he who is ignorant of them might understand them:
And they are made of iron or steel, properly, and their extremities are adorned with this triangular fineness, the tip sharp, just as that is the form.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
When various types of flesh grow in the nose, from some cause resembling a very heavy scorpion, or a large polyp; and this disease is called polyps because it resembles that depicted fish. And from it is cancerous flesh, ulcerous, of dark color; and from it is that which is lion flesh, not of dark color.
Therefore, in those flesh growths that are not fraudulent or cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands and expose them to the sun, and dry their nostrils, and prick the growths with your lancet. And then, remove it to the outside, and then cut what you have grasped from those growths with a sharp, thin spathe from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; because if any part from which it is possible to excise remains, then you should cut it with one of the thin instruments easily until there remains nothing of it. But if it is inflamed with blood or a hot abscess, then you apply what is appropriate; or if it is a malignant abscess, then you cauterize and burn it until the blood is removed and all the cavities are gone.
And then, put a mixture of vinegar and water or wine in the nose near the incision. But if the nose is open and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you know that it is already healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is flesh or excess pus on the bones of the nostrils to which the excision has not reached.
Therefore, then it is necessary to insert a piece of lint (or similar material) of some thickness, and put many small pieces, placing the amount of a finger or less between each piece, and placing the patient in a position where one end of the lint can be inserted into the nostrils with a probe or other suitable instrument.
And after you have done that, cause him to draw his breath in until it reaches the nasal passages, and it emerges over his throat, for many times children in school demonstrate a similar action, and it is an easy thing for one who wishes to do it.
And then, place the two ends of the leech, one end extending over the nose and the other remaining inside the nose, and then administer a piece of meat with the nuts contained within the leech, and do this until you know that the meat is now inside the leech's nuts.
And then, remove the leech, and place a cautery near the extraction of blood in the nose, and do this for three days or more until the unguent has completely dissolved all remaining flesh.
And finally, place a lead cannula in the nose for several days until it is healed.
But if you require a more complete cure, use this one.
And this is the form of the instrument for nasal purging, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And make this of silver or brass, which should resemble a small, open lamp, like a small shell, and similarly shaped at the opening.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the purging instrument should be flat, uncovered; at the rear of which there should be a handle, with which you hold it when heating the oil or water you wish, or juices and subtle substances.
Chapter 25.
Of the oils applied to the nostrils.
Many times oil is applied to the nostrils, and it is magnified and increased over several days until the condition is greatly improved.
And therefore, you must address it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate the entire thing. And then place a cautery or a burning medicine on the affected area.
However, if its treatment is delayed until it has become aggravated, then consider if it is hardened, tough, dark-colored, and insensitive.  If so, do not touch it with iron, for it is a deep-seated abscess; for often, the one who cuts into this abscess risks inflicting great harm upon the afflicted person.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch and not dark-colored, and incision is possible throughout it, then drain the affected area and make the incision without fear, and treat the area with something that dries and tightens until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when their continuity is broken by plague or similar illnesses.
Know that when you encounter a break in continuity in one of these cartilages, you accomplish little in that operation except for a few skilled individuals.
Therefore, when you encounter such a condition, consider whether it's fresh plague with its own blood.  If so, you should join the two sides of the wound with stitches and then treat it until it heals.
And if the edges of the broken skin are already separated, and each is healthy, then it is necessary for you to scrape away each portion of their visible scabs until blood comes out. Then join the two edges with stitches, tightening them, and sprinkle dragon's blood and crushed asafoetida over them.  Place a piece of diaphanous plaster, or another of the consolidating plasters, over the powder, and leave it bound for two or three days.  Then remove it and change the plaster, leaving it until the pus is completely gone, and then treat with ointment until healed.
But the method of stitching is that you should either join the broken skin with needles as we have described in the suturing of the belly, or you should join it with glue, as we have explained to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things that appear between the two lips in the interior parts.
Often, in the inner parts of the lips of men, some hard abscesses appear, resembling the grains of millet, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore, you must turn the lips over and cut away each of those hardnesses from all sides. Then, with sharp instruments, you should fill the area with pressed, dried sawdust until the bleeding is stopped. Then, the area should be washed with sharp wine and treated with something astringent until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of the flesh adhered to the gums.
Often, flesh adhered to the gums, which the ancients called "albulus," is present.  Then you should detach it with a forceps or scissors, and cut it away from its roots, allowing the pus or blood to drain.
And then apply pressed, dried sawdust, or other astringent or drying powders to the area.
And if that flesh returns, then cut it away again, and cauterize it, for the cautery will now prevent its return.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with an iron instrument.
When on the surface of the teeth, both on the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, rough, hard, and sometimes black or yellowish crusts form, and the gums become inflamed by this, and the teeth become loose.
Therefore, you should position the patient between your hands, placing their head on your lap, and carefully extract those teeth on which such crusts and similar, gritty substances appear, until no trace of them remains, thus removing the blackness, yellowness, and other impurities.
If you have removed what was present at the beginning of the procedure, then good; if not, then repeat the procedure on those teeth the next day, and the following day, and a third time, until they reach the desired state.
And know that teeth require many tools of various shapes and forms, depending on what is needed for your procedure. And therefore, the file used to file the tooth from the inside is different from the file used to file between the teeth, in other shapes, and these files should be prepared by you, which you will see shortly.
Chapter 30.
Of the removal of teeth.
You must treat the tooth's pain with all diligence and take your time in any tooth extraction, because there is no remedy that surpasses the time spent on it when it is extracted, because it is a subtle substance until the extraction is completed.
However, when the patient requires that tooth to be extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is the painful one, for many times the pain deceives the patient and indicates that it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one, and the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the operations of barbers.
Therefore, how must you be certain which tooth is painful, and that you know it well? Then you must scrape around the tooth with a substance having some virtue until it is detached from the gum on every side, and then gently remove it with your fingers, or with very fine forceps, little by little, until you have removed it completely.
And then, if it requires strong forceps for good grip or sturdy structure, place the patient's head between your knees so you hold it securely and then pull out the tooth straight so you do not break it, and do not cause further pain to the patient.
And therefore, if it is not easily removed, then take one of those instruments and place it under it from every side with ease and exert the removal just as you did at first.
But if the tooth is cracked or decayed, then you must cover the crack with cloth and compress it with a fine pointed instrument so that it does not break during the process of removing it with forceps.
And you must carefully scrape around the entire gum area, and keep a strong grip so that you do not break it and leave a piece, and return the patient to the harm that could be worse than the initial pain.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their eagerness and boldness in tooth extraction, without administering what we have described; for often they cause serious illnesses in men that are more difficult to treat, leaving the roots all, or some of them, remaining, or even pulling out some jawbone with the tooth, as we have witnessed many times.
And after the extraction, the mouth should be rinsed with warm wine or vinegar with salt.
And if there is excessive bleeding, as often happens, then apply a bit of wool and sprinkle it over the wound, and if that doesn't stop it, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and delicate pliers used to begin removing the tooth should be long on the end, with a short, thick handle, so that they do not bend when using them.
And they should be like a thick handle, so that when you squeeze with them, they don't bend; have short ends.
And they should be made of Indian steel, with straight ends, and on those ends there should be teeth which interlock and grip tightly with strong constriction; and sometimes the ends of those have the shape of a stork's beak, that is, a hook, and are very constricting.
Chapter 31.
Of the removal of teeth and extraction of bones from fractured jaws.
When you must remove a broken tooth which remains in place, you should apply a cloth soaked in hot water for a day or two until the area is softened; then, grasp the tooth with forceps, whose tips are shaped like the beak of a stork (or a hook), the shape of a pair of forceps:
The tips of the forceps should be made with a file or emery.
And if you cannot extract the tooth with these forceps or pliers, then you must carefully dig around the root and expose all the flesh, and insert an instrument called a small lever, which is shaped like this:
And it should have a short, thick end, a little bit, so that it is not broken.
Therefore, if the root is thus pulled out, good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the shapes: the shape of the first instrument is triangular-ended, of some thickness:
The shape of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and have a more slender tip.
And having already been helped with this instrument with two ramps, the shape of which is approximately as follows: and with other instruments, which I will describe in detail later; for assistance is given with this instrument, which resembles a large hook, and this is the form:
of a triangular, bent or short tip, which has some thickness, and which should not be too sharp so that it does not break.
And you should know that the instruments for the teeth are very similar to the other instruments.
However, a skilled and clever craftsman in the art will discover for himself, according to what the operation and the various illnesses indicate to him; for there are illnesses for which the ancients did not prescribe or create a specific instrument, due to the diverse forms of the conditions.
However, if the bone of the jaw or other bones in the mouth are fractured or diseased, then it should be treated in its place with whatever is appropriate from the instruments and forceps we have described for the extraction of tooth roots, and it will be helpful with a technique, whose form is this:
And it should be gradually reduced in size, and held or squeezed with the mouth so that it does not escape or loosen until the entire bone is fully repositioned; then restore the area with appropriate remedies for this.
However, if there is a small swelling on the bone, then remove that swelling and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Of the treatment of teeth protruding beyond the others.
When teeth protrude beyond their natural position, causing an uneven shape, especially in women, and particularly in young women, you must consider: if a tooth is close to another tooth, and separation or a ligature is not possible, then extract that tooth; but if it is not connected to another tooth, then you should cut it with this instrument, the shape of which is like a pig's snout, made of Indian iron with a very sharp tip.
And make your incision with the instrument, cutting into the tooth over several days due to its hardness, so that it does not damage other teeth.
And if the protruding tooth is exposed for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of this shape:
And it should be entirely made of Indian iron, and easily tempered; and it should have many small points, just like the file used to make needles, with which the tooth can be filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. And then carefully line it up at the end, and cut it (the tooth) out using a few razors.
And if a part of the tooth is fractured and hurts the tongue, then you must file it down until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and it is made whole so that the tongue is not injured and speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
Of restoring damaged teeth with gold or silver fillings.
When teeth are fractured or dislodged by impact or a blow, and the patient cannot properly bite down, and you have treated it with astringent medicines, and your treatment has not been successful, then, in order to prevent it from rotting, the gaps should be filled with gold, not silver, because silver turns green and may rot after a few days, but gold never changes.
And the filling should be of such a thinness and thickness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the method of insertion is to take the filling and place double that amount between two healthy teeth, then gradually increase the amount with two curves of the filling between the damaged teeth, whether one or many, until the material reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the insertion until the starting point, and gently and skillfully compress it until it is no longer damaged.
And your grip, with which you compress the filling, must be on the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose.
Then you trim the excess filling with forceps or nippers, and adjust them in each place with skill, and shape and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so as not to injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightly fitted as it remains.
But if it is loose or broken, compress it or them with more filling in such a way at all times.
And this is the method for teeth and the method of repairing two healthy and two damaged teeth, thus when these are joined:
And when one or two teeth are returned to the fitting of each in their places, and they have grown back as we have recounted, and remain.
And only skilled and knowledgeable craftsmen can do this.
And sometimes a substitute is made from the bones of a cow, shaped like a tooth, and placed in the gap where the tooth is missing, and compressed as we said, and it remains and serves as a replacement for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Of the binding of the ligament which is in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament, which sometimes lies under the tongue, is either natural, present from birth, or accidental and caused by a wound that has healed.
And the operation on it involves opening the patient's mouth, their head held securely by you; lifting their tongue, and then carefully cutting that nerve ligament along its width until the tongue is released from its confinement.
However, if there is any hardness or knotting there, resulting from the healing of a wound, then apply a cauterizing agent and cut along its width until you have severed the ligament and the knot has dissolved.
And be careful not to create a tear in the flesh and that the cut doesn't go too deep, causing excessive bleeding.
And then wash the cut with water or vinegar or cold water; and then place a linen pad under the tongue; this is a bandage the patient will wear under the tongue every night to prevent it from sticking again.
But if bleeding occurs, place powdered vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a blunt cautery suitable for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of the removal of a ranula (a cyst) under the tongue.
Sometimes, an abscess forms under the tongue, resembling a small tumor, hindering the tongue's natural function; and it grows significantly until it fills the mouth.
And the treatment for it is to open the patient's mouth, sitting facing the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it [the abscess] of a dark color, or black, hard, to which the patient does not feel sensitivity, then do not touch that which is cancer.
And if it has turned to a whitish color, in which there is moisture, then you insert your forceps there, and make an incision with a thin scalpel, and cut it from every side; and if blood comes out during your operation, then you place over it crushed egg white, i.e. vitriol, until the bleeding is controlled.
And then return to your work until you have extracted it completely, until it is washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Of the extraction of abscesses in the two ears, and that which is on the neck, and other abscesses.
When an abscess develops on the neck, it's often glands that are swollen and inflamed.  These become external and are called 'the two ears'; if you treat them with what we've said in the discussion and they don't heal, then you must consider if the abscess is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive.  If so, do not touch it with an iron.
And if it is reddish and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron for fear of blood flow. Instead, let it mature; then either you will lance it or it will break open on its own.
And if it is white, soft, and its root is thin, then it is suitable to be incised.
And the operation on it requires you to consider, before your operation, whether the abscess has already been softened by complete rest or if it has diminished with any reduction. Then, have the patient sit in the sun, with their head in your lap, and open their mouth. The attendant should grasp and press down the patient's tongue with a very fine instrument, which has this form:
And it should be made of silver or bronze, and be thin like a knife.
So, as you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and you have placed your gaze upon it, then take a lancet and place it on the abscess, and draw it outwards to the sides as much as you can. After you have drawn some of the tissues, then cut that with an instrument of this form:
After you have drawn some of the tissues, then cut that with an instrument of this form: and it resembles forceps, but its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is facing the other, very sharp, which should be made of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a scalpel, of which this is the form: And it should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have incised one incision, cut the other following this same method of incision, and then the patient will recover from cold water.
However, if there is bleeding, treat with water decoction of pomegranate bark or myrtle leaves, or similar astringents, until the bleeding is reduced, and then treat it until healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat or near the two ears, and incise them as I have described in the incision of two incisions above.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat, an abscess that was tending towards a dark color, with little sensation, which had already narrowed her throat, and the woman was breathing with a constricted airway, and had been forbidden from eating and drinking water, and she would have died if it had lasted just one or two more days.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had formed two channels before bursting through two openings.
Therefore, I treated it fistularly, and placed a probe into one of the openings, and pulled it out, and a large portion came out with it, and then I cut that from where it connected to the other opening, and then I opened her mouth, and held her tongue down, and then I placed the probe into that abscess.
And then I excised a large portion of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore, the woman's throat was completely healed, and she immediately began drinking water, and then eating food.  Thus, I did not cease to cut into that abscess many times for a long time, and another abscess succeeded in its place, which I also cut into until it was resolved.
Therefore, I cauterized the throat of her, thus bringing relief; and then I wandered and did not know what God had done to her nearby me.
Chapter 37.
Of the incision of a boil when it is suppurated.
When a sore throat affects the uvula, and it is suppurated and long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part, thick and round, then it is called a boil.
However, when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and you do not confirm your cure, and sometimes a suppurating boil is already subdued and subtle, then you must incise that which is swollen and round; and if it is of that length, and is bloody, dark-colored or black, and is not sensitive to touch, then you must attempt its incision, for there is a fear for the patient in that.
And when you see it according to the way I have described, by its whiteness and length, you should have the patient sit down and press the tongue with an instrument that displays its shape and then place the lancet on the new boil, pull it downwards, and incise it with one of the two instruments that we call 'incising two boils'.
And you must not incise it except what is aligned with the natural boundary without addition, for if you incise further, you will worsen its condition.
And after the incision, use what we have described in the incision of two boils, and treat it until it is healed.
However, if the patient is frightened by the incision, you should use cauterization without fear, and the method of cauterization there is only with sharp water.  You should place the patient's head on your lap, then press their tongue with the instrument we mentioned, and then take the water, as described in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it with a burning stick.  Do not use a thick or thin layer, and fill the cavity of the instrument, which is shaped like [… (the description of the instrument's shape is missing)].
Let the extremity of it [the instrument] be concave, like the bowl of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine over the wound.  The patient should lie on their side so that saliva or mucus from the mouth flows away from the medicine, so that nothing drips down the throat and irritates it.
And then, hold your hand with the medicine, and press it on the uvula for half an hour, until you see it blackened and calmed by the medicine's action.
And if you wish, take a piece of cloth and wrap it around the end of the [medical] instrument, dip the cloth in the medicine, and insert the instrument with the cloth-covered end into a tube or canal until the cloth adheres to it.  Do this many times until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula. Then, leave it to dry and fall off in about three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it.  Then, after the cauterization, clean the area around the uvula with a cloth soaked in water or broth, removing any remaining medicine.  Wash with cold water and treat the outside with a soothing ointment, and internally with remedies until healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incision and less prone to complications.
Sometimes the uvula is treated with a method more delicate than cauterization or incision, through fumigation in this way: take balm, hyssop, origanum, rue, Arabic cicuta, chamomile, rosemary, and similar herbs, and combine all of them, or some of them, in a pot, and immerse them in sour wine and bring to a boil. The pot should be properly sealed, and a hole in the center of the pot should have a concave brass instrument placed over it, be it made of silver or brass.
And the end [of the instrument] should be inserted into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is considerably softened.
And then repeat this many times until it [the uvula] is dry.  Be careful not to use this treatment at the beginning of an abscess, for it would only worsen the abscess;  you should not do this unless the abscess is already hot.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and place a hard-boiled egg shell at its end, so that the patient's mouth is covered; for the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of the removal of thorns and of that which adheres to the throat, and of other similar matters.
Often thorns or fish bones or some other thing adhere to the throat.
Then you should remove what is clearly visible, focusing on it.  Press the tongue with an instrument in front of the light, so that what is in the throat is revealed to you.
And what is hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for a foreign object adhering to the throat will be expelled by vomiting; or have the patient swallow a piece of bread or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or let the patient take a piece of dry sea sponge, tightly wrapped in wool, and then the patient swallows this, for as it reaches the place where the thorn is, it will be expelled. And further, take an eel and drink it, wrapped in wool, and place it inside [the throat] and it will be drawn out; or take a leek and place it inside, and then draw it out.
But if it is not expelled by those methods we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this way:
And it should be slightly larger than a small finger, and at its end there should be a concavity that you can easily insert into the patient's throat.
And have the patient raise their head, and be careful not to touch their throat bone, so that it does not hurt, and with that [instrument] push on the bone or thorn, or the physician with their hand.
But the patient should, with their knowledge of the location of the cause, gently push downwards, and pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all according to the amount that is prepared until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
Of the extraction of a bloodsucker attached to the throat.
When the leech is medicated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and it doesn't work, then consider the area of the patient's throat in the sun, after you have pressed the patient's tongue with an instrument as we have described.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it with a small knife or with gentle, skillful movements.
And if it is not possible to remove it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat.  Then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this repeatedly (until the leech is dead and detached from the throat).  Keep the patient away from water all day.
Then take a bowl filled with cold water, and open the patient's mouth into it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not allow the patient to swallow anything and hold the water for another hour with your hand, for the leech, as soon as it feels the water, will fall off.
But if it is not dislodged by what we have described, then fumigate the patient with incense or asafoetida using the instrument we described for fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall off.
And another method of fumigation for that is that you take a bowl containing burning coals, and the bowl is covered with a cover in the middle of which is a hole, and the tip of the instrument is placed in that hole.  Then you must perform the fumigation above it; and place the patient's mouth on the tip of the cannula, and close their mouth to ensure the fumigation does not escape until you know that it has reached the leech, for the leech will fall off as soon as the fumigation reaches it.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and prevent the patient from drinking, and have them eat salty things and herbs, and do not allow them to drink water, and with this treatment it will be necessary for it to be expelled.
And this is the shape of the instrument with which the leech from the throat is treated when it is visible; and it is similar to forceps in some ways, but it has a slight curve in some places. which is placed on the throat, and its tip is similar to a stork's beak, which is smooth, on which a file is used, so that when we grasp something, it does not slip.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discourse on the appearance of abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are of many types, in many ways, according to their appearance, each one described in this book.
And they are diverse in their puncture and incision, in two ways, of which one is according to the type of abscess itself; and due to the moisture we grasp.
And the second way is according to the places on the body where they occur, for the abscess that occurs in the head is different from the abscess that occurs in the buttocks; and the abscess in a fleshy area is different from the abscess that occurs in a joint; and for each of these, there is a specific treatment.
And some abscesses must not be incised until the pus has matured within them, or until they are fully developed.
Some other abscesses should be lanced while they are inflamed and have not matured, such as those near joints.  For, when an abscess is near a joint, its growth extends until it could damage the surrounding tissue, and the ligaments or nerves of that joint are easily corrupted, causing the limb to contract.  Or, if the abscess is near a vital part of the body, delay in lancing it until maturity could harm the vital area.  Or, if it's near the anus, lance it even if it isn't fully mature.  Do not lance an unripe, incompletely digested one, but one near the anus, so you do not rupture it and cause an extension of the problem into the internal parts of the anus and create a fistula, or cause harm to the surrounding area which won't heal. But you must know the time to lance the abscess, and that is when it is mature.
You will know it is mature when the pain subsides, the fever ceases, the swelling and throbbing decrease, the head of the abscess becomes firmer, and other similar signs appear.
And because you must lance the abscess in the pus-filled area below it, and from the swelling's drainage.
And always make the incision along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the areas of the hands or feet, and in locations away from the tendons, nerves, and arteries; and, in all similar areas where there is no reflex action.  For, in those places that are reflex-sensitive, use a method of incision appropriate to that specific body part.
However, when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to leave it until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said, for if you lance it before that, you prolong the patient's suffering, add to the dirt, and make the abscess walls hardened and deep.
But some abscesses must be lanced across the breadth of the flesh or body, depending on the need or the specific requirements of the affected limb.
And you must administer a small incision for small abscesses, and a large, wide incision, or multiple incisions, depending on the size of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses in which the boil must be hollowed out and incised when it is ready, as when dealing with swellings and boils.
And some are incised with a three-sided cut; and some are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, as are the abscesses of the joints.
And some are treated with a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar ones.
But those in which no such procedure is appropriate, like superficial abscesses, you should pierce with a superficial, or simple, incision.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should pierce it and not try to remove all the matter at once; having removed a portion, then close the abscess until the next day, and then remove a larger portion, and repeat this many times according to the degree until it is entirely discharged.
And especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person in decline, for the animal spirit is often weakened by the discharge of pus, and the patient often dies quickly, and you must proceed cautiously.
Observe this chapter with great caution, and for your incision in which you pierce these abscesses, you should clean the sores and consider whether the abscess wound is small, or a simple incision, then apply ointments of lead or old linen; and if the abscess is large and the fissures of the incision are many, then you must place medicaments in each opening until they join together.
And if in the abscess a part of the skin has been separated or has been incised around the circumference, then you should fill it with old linen or cloth thread, as when you have removed bread or roots, without moisture; and keep it tight until the third day; and then you should process it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.
But if blood flows during your procedure, then apply cold water and vinegar in which you have dipped a linen cloth, and place this over the site of the blood flow repeatedly.
But if the blood flow persists, then you must administer treatment and remedies, and powders which have been recounted in many places in this book and in various divisions.
But if it is wintertime, and the location of the abscess is a place with many nerves, then you must soak powders in warm wine and oil, and apply those to the affected areas.
And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you must apply powders soaked in water and oil, or wine and oil, and all this should remain cold until the third day, as we have said.  Then you must open the abscess, cleanse it, and apply the appropriate treatment until it heals.
And this is what is necessary for the understanding of the treatment of abscesses in general; but according to the method of distinction that I have already mentioned, the treatment of each type of abscess is described in individual chapters.
Chapter 41.
Of the lancing of abscesses which arise on the neck of the head.
Small abscesses occur on the neck of the head, and these are of the nature of lumps that contain membranes surrounding them; and the content of these lumps is pus.
And they have pus, and that pus contains a moisture resembling lime. And some contain a moisture resembling dust, and some are like them; and some are hard, like stones.
And in the lancing of all of them, and in the extraction of these, there is no fear, as the extraction of these does not cause contrary arrows.
And the surgical procedure for lancing these is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is similar to this, which is called a lancet, until you know what they contain.
For if what it contains is moisture, then you cut it with a lengthwise incision, a superficial incision in this manner:
And begin the incision along line B to line G.  Then, once the moisture is drained, scrape away the skin that contained the moisture, and leave no remnants of it at all, for it often returns if any part remains.
And then, soak some cotton in Egyptian ointment, if available, or else in water and salt; and fill the wound with that and leave it until the next day, for this will corrode any remaining skin remnants.
And then repeat applying Egyptian ointment to the cotton a second and third time, if necessary, until you are confident that there are no remaining remnants of that skin; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodules, then you cut it in this manner: with an incision shaped like a cross, and insert hooks between the two edges of the incision and scrape it from every side, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane that contains it.
But if your arrowhead causes resistance, then do as I have first described to you.
And similarly, treat a stony abscess with incision and treatment as we have told you; and incision on a stony abscess is easier, because it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are on the head in some men, which lack moisture;  the reason why is that I incised an abscess on the head of an elderly woman and found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if someone were to strike it, it would hurt.
But in other accidental abscesses on the head, this is not the topic, like the abscesses that occur on the heads of children and near the roots of the ears, but the incision for all of these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation in those from the lower part, so that the body's pus is drained to the lower parts.
And then treat those with what is appropriate for their treatment.
Chapter 42.
Of the incision of scrofulas that occur on the neck.
Often these abscesses appear on the neck and armpits and groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that appear on the neck, and many are generated among them, and every scrofula of those is inside its own tunic, and thus like in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for among them are some stony ones, and of those are some containing moisture, and of those are some malignant ones which do not yield to cure.
Therefore, in that one which you see to be well-disposed in the touch, whose visible color is similar to the color of the boil, and is soft in every direction, and is not attached to the neck's nerve, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, and is not deep, you should incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body, along the line from G to B, and cleanse it thoroughly, and extend the flaps of the boil with forceps, or with many forceps if you need them, as we have said in the case of head abscesses, and extract it little by little.
And it is more important that the vein or nerve is not cut.
And if the swelling is not very acute, do not apply your hand with an incision, or disturb the patient, and do not incise what is unnecessary to incise; for if you cut a vein or artery and you hinder your operation, then apply powdered vitriol or other powders that stop blood flow, and tighten the wound, and leave it until the inflammation subsides, the wound softens, and begins to fester. When the blood is drawn off.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then, probe with your index finger if there are any other small causes of the scrofulas, and then incise them and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the base of the boil, you should then not incise that boil at its root. Before that, you should bind that with tightly folded linen and leave it until it falls away of itself without harm.
And then, fill the wound with old lint that you have already soaked in Egyptian unguent, and then treat it.
And if you incise the entire boil, then you should bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch it up as soon as there is no excess fluid remaining.
But if you see that there is excess fluid due to the size of the boil, you should then proceed to incise the root of that, and drain it, and apply stitches and what has been mentioned (referencing previous instructions).
And that boil which contains moisture, pierce it superficially where the area of its maturation appears to you, and place the puncture so that the pus runs down the body, just as we have said.
And then apply a poultice, some with unguent and similar substances, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And when you see the wound is already cleansed, then you treat it with a flesh-generating unguent until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Of the incision of a boil/abscess that has appeared in the throat.
The ancients described this incision on a boil, and no one in our land has seen it done.
And this is the writing/inscription of their/those teachings.
However, in those with a spine condition, the extraction of the boil should be avoided, because it will not bring healing, since all the veins and major blood vessels of the patient are located there.
But for those with hot abscesses in the mouth, throat, or ears, when the illness is not in the chest, one should use the incision of the boil to avoid the destruction caused by cauterization.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should cut the boil below the three circles surrounding the boil, or four with small incisions, proportionally between two circles, and the incision should be made in a slanted manner, not on the cartilage. This place is suitable for incision, because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are far away.
And if the physician is afraid, then he should extend the membrane of the throat with a scalpel, and then cut the membrane until he reaches the channel, but avoid the blood vessels if he sees any cause for concern.
And then, cut the boil in the manner we have described; and it is indicated that cutting the channel releases the pus that is coming out from the broken tissue, and through the removal of the sound.
And leave the wound open for a period of time.
Therefore, when the time has passed in which perforation is feared, bring together the two edges of the wound's membrane, and stitch them together, excluding the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the treatment we have described, the explanation is nothing other than to see that some of these abscesses have already affected the patient's windpipe, and the patient has been brought to death's door, and the patient's breath is cut off, and some proceed to cut the epiglottis so that the patient may breathe through the area of the wound with some respiration, and be saved from death.
And because of this, I command leaving the wound open until the virulence of the illness is consumed; and its virulence lasts for three days; and then, I command to stitch the wound and treat it until it is healed.
And this I have seen with my own eyes, that a servant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and with that knife cut a portion of the windpipe, and I was called to treat her, and found her in the same state as a dead person, and I discovered the wound and found little blood that had come from the wound.
Therefore, I was told that she had not cut a vein or artery, and air was coming from the wound, and I treated her until she was healed.
And it did not happen to the servant if she did not have a problem with her voice, and after a few days, she returned to better health.
And now I say that there is no fear in the section of the epilepsy.
Chapter XLIV.
Of incision on an abscess that occurs in the throat outside, and is called a hernia of the throat.
This abscess, called a hernia of the throat, is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and it is common in women.
And it is in two ways, for it is either natural or accidental.
And in the natural case, it is not possible to cure it.
And the accidental type is in two ways, one of which is similar to fatty tumors, and the other way is similar to an abscess formed by the knotting of an artery, and in that case there is fear [of serious consequences]. And one should not use a cautery iron on it unless it is small. And you should test and investigate it with the probe, and if you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should cut into it like a tumor, and remove whatever is contained within the skin and pouch; but if not, then its entire nature must be examined, and the site should be treated with appropriate remedies until healed.
Chapter 45.
Of the incision of the types of tumors.
There are many types of tumors, and I have already described all their types in the division.
And it is necessary for me to recount the difference between a tumor and a fistula, in case of doubt.
Thus I say that with a fistula there is heat, fever, and violent pain until the ebullition of the excess is calmed; and when the putrefaction is complete, the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a tumor there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it resembles the lion's share that is in the own sack.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a lump and is made thus, whether larger or smaller, and there are two types, for either it is fatty and contains moisture, and the colours of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Therefore, when you approach the treatment of a tumor, examine and inquire into it at the beginning with an instrument called an "intromes," as its form will appear in the chapter following this one.
And it is a way of inquiring into abscesses and all tumors, by taking this instrument and inserting it into the most moist place you find in the abscess, and you will move your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the membrane.
And finally, place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the intromes and consider what has emerged on the residue of it.
And if the flowing moisture, of whatever color, is expelled, then you cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said in other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture from the residue of the intromes, then know that it is fat.
And dry it over it with a cross-shaped incision, following this form: As I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and easily scrape the skin from all sides, and preserve the skin or sac, if possible, over it, and remove the pus with a node.
But if it breaks during the operation, it is not possible to remove that pus, and this often happens, and then you remove it in pieces until there remains no trace of it.
For if any residue, little or much, remains, the node will return according to the method.
And if you see that any small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and bind the wound, and place a poultice over the pus pocket, and treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And if it is a large node, then you stitch the two edges of it and treat it with what causes it to heal.
But if there is a pulsating vein nearby, or a non-pulsating one, then you cauterize and fill the area with crushed verdigris (a type of vitriol) and leave it there for two or three days until the wound can heal and the blood's swelling subsides; and then return to cutting that which remains of the node.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary in surgery and perforation.
Of those, there are three types of instruments, some large, some medium, and some small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They are made of iron, or bronze, with properly sharpened ends, so that they can easily penetrate abscesses.
And these are the forms of the experienced, and they are called probes, and one of them is called a *berid* (or *berid* probe).
And there are three types, for some are large, medium, and small.
The form of the large probe, its shape:
The form of the medium probe, its shape:
The form of the small probe, its shape:
It is suitable for those abscesses, fistulas, and buboes,  because within them are bones and other things.
And make them round, thick, pointed, like large needles with which saddles are stitched, and they are made of citrus wood, or horn, or iron, or silver.  The best are those made of citrus wood.
And the probes are made of black lead, which are believed to open fistulas in whose cavities there are reflections, which are reflected by their lightness with those reflections.
And they are of three kinds, for some of them are long, and others are medium, and others short, according to the width of the fistula and its constriction.
Shape of the large lead probe:
Shape of the medium lead probe:
Shape of the small lead probe:
The shapes of the probes are of many kinds, for some of them are simply single curves, and these are of three kinds: large, small, and medium.
And of them are also hooked probes, and these are of three kinds.
And of those are probes with two curves, and these are of three kinds.
And of them are those with three curves, and these are of three kinds.
And all of these are necessary in their place.
Form of a small simple probe, its form:
Form of a large probe having two curves: Shape of a woman's finger having two curves: Shape of a slightly curved finger having two curves:
Shape of a large finger having three curves:
Shape of a medium-sized finger having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which the knots and abscesses are cut and scraped, and they are of three kinds, namely large, medium, and small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium-sized scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The cutting edges of these scalpels are sharp, and the other edges are blunt, and they are not placed in such a manner as to cause unnecessary injury when scraping the knots. This is to avoid cutting a vein or nerve, so that the patient is healed and finds a small amount of tranquility through the burning sensation found near the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the shapes of scalpels, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of iron and are similar in shape to a saw, with which alcohol is applied.
And it has a pointed end with a hidden spike, and in that area it has passages inside and outside, which you can open and close as you wish.
The shapes of lancets, which are hidden between the fingers to pierce abscesses and are not seen by the patients, come in three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those:
The shapes of cupping glasses, with which the flow of blood is drawn, come in three types: large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They are made of citrus wood, round with some length, and are slender.
And it is necessary that these types of cupping glasses, large, medium, and small, be available, so that through them the flow of blood is drawn quickly when needed, and then, when initially used, it is not a medicine.
However, do not use them to draw blood from every part of the body, but only on fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, the arms, breasts, stomach, knees, and similar fleshy, moist areas.
And sometimes other small instruments are made like thin bladders of this shape, through which blood is drawn when performed by phlebotomy, or by the incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round, in this shape:
Chapter 47.
Concerning the treatment of male breasts that resemble those of women.
Sometimes, the breasts of some men become swollen during sleep, as they start to grow hair, and then the breasts swell, resembling those of women, and become ulcerated, sore.
And whoever treats this, should incise them with a lunar incision along the line from B to G, remove all the excess tissue, then fill the wound with a flesh-producing medicine, stitch the edges of the wound together, and care for it until it is healed.
But if the breast descends and is softened by its size, like that of women, then it should be cut into two parts, with two incisions resembling a lunar shape, each contained within the other at the end of each, until the major line contains the minor, following the shape of line B and G.  Then, remove the excess tissue between the two edges of the wound, and eliminate the fat.  Apply the suturing and powders mentioned earlier, as necessary for the healing process, until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision necessary due to the patient's discomfort or bleeding, then the wound should be filled with cotton soaked in a corrosive unguent, leaving it until the remaining fat is corroded away, and then continue treatment until healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the lancing of abscesses that arise below the armpit.
These abscesses arising below the armpit are a type of scrofulous, hard swelling, containing a sac-like skin.
And some of those contain moisture; and those containing moisture should be incised with a lunar (crescent-shaped) cut, following this figure: from line G to line B.  And when all the pus in the abscess has been evacuated, then fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.
And then the cotton should be removed and the wound treated with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
And if the abscess is of the type associated with nodes and scrofulous swellings, then you make the incision in the same way as we described in the section on scrofulous swellings.
And if the sore has spread to the point of ulceration, then apply a cautery to it as previously described.
Chapter 49.
Of the incision of abscesses that occur from arrow wounds or vein injuries.
When an arrow wound is inflicted, and the surrounding tissue is thickened, often an abscess develops.  And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are caused by an artery or vein: for when an abscess is caused by an arrow wound, it is long and concentrated near the body's surface; and when you probe the abscess with your fingers, you feel a whistling sound.
And the one caused by a vein is round and apparent on the body's surface.
And incision on this abscess is a mistake, especially in those beneath the armpits, in the elbows, and in the neck, and in many other places of the body; and if it is large, then its treatment with iron should be avoided.  And that which is on the extremities, or the head, should be avoided [in terms of incisions].
However, for those arising from inflammation of the arrow wound's opening, make an incision along the wound's length;  then scrape away the surrounding tissue using hooks, and carefully remove the arrow, freeing it from its coverings until it is exposed.
Then insert a needle and drive it through to the other side, and tie the arrow with a doubled thread at two points –  which I [or "you"] show to you as an example in the extraction of two arrows, which were in the temples.
And then prick the area between the two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood flows out, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer a treatment in the area where pus has formed until the ligaments fall away; and then treat it with suitable ointments until it is healed.
And if the abscess is caused by a cut vein, then you must hold with your hand whatever of the abscess you can grasp with the incision, and then insert the needle under the area you held with your hand and drive it through; and tie it with a double thread until you extract it from the other side, and then bind the abscess with a strong ligature, as I have told you, in the ligature of grapes, with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear pulling out the thread, then insert the thread with the needle under the entire abscess below the incision of the first needle, and tie your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in its center until whatever is in it has come out, then you cut away the excess of the incision, and leave what remains tied.
And then place on it a poultice soaked in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment made with herbs and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess that occurs due to nerve twisting.
Thus, as abscesses occur in arteries and veins, similarly, abscesses occur in nerves when they are injured by percussion or by excessive exertion, and similar causes.
And it is most likely to occur in the places where the tendons or heels are, or in any place where joints are strained.
And it is a serious abscess, and it resembles the color of the rest of the body, and it is in the most exposed parts of the body, without much external sign, and when it is intense, the patient feels a similar numbness.
And it is not an abscess that is concentrated in one part of the body, therefore it is under the skin, and it is painful in all directions, and it does not spread to the front or back parts.
Therefore, those abscesses that are in the joints should not be lanced with iron, for it would likely cause a contraction.
But that which is on the head or forehead, pierce through the skin with a pointed instrument. But if it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps and excise it at the root.
And if it is large, then lift it with forceps, and scrape it, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Of the incision of an abscess that arises from a boil that appears on the abdomen.
Many times, in the abdomens of some people, and other parts of their bodies, there appear boils which are called "fungal" due to their resemblance to fungi. Their roots are thin and their heads are large; and their edges are turned inward, and some are small, while others are greatly enlarged.
And I myself have seen one, and in his abdomen were two boils which were more like fungi, and there was no difference between them, being white, with fine roots.
And their edges were inverted and split, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Therefore, I incised them and found one weighing eighteen ounces and the other six ounces.
And the procedure for their incision is that you must consider whether the patient is feverish, and if the boil's color is white, moist, with thin roots; then you must cut them with a broad spatula, and you should have cauteries in the fire, because often during their incision much blood is expelled; and if you see blood escaping, cauterize that area.
And if the patient is fearful and timid, avoid incision with iron; instead, take freshly made lead filings, and press the boil with them, in the manner we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then, adjust the lead strip's tightness; therefore, do not cease pressing the lead on the boil until it is severed and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the boil has thick roots, then its incision causes some fear and anxiety, especially if it is on the abdomen.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize that area so that it does not return.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to presume to incise a boil that is dark in color, with little sensitivity, and slow to heal, for that one is likely cancerous.
And I will bring a remedy for cancer to that.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the treatment of a swelling of the navel.
A swelling of the navel is caused by various things; either by fissures in the skin covering the abdomen, and there the tissue or intestines protrude as in other ruptures; or by blood flowing from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned, or by trapped air in the area.
However, if it is due to a fissure in the skin and protrusion of tissue, then the color of the abscess resembles the color of the body; and it is painless, and appears at various locations. And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then its location is different from what we have described, with more extreme variations, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and then returns; and it is very painful there, and greatly magnified near the entrance of the bathing (bath) and a violent struggle.
But if it is due to moisture, then it is painless and does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor is it considered serious.
And if it is due to blood, then the abscess shows signs of a darkening, or a blackening.
But if it is due to dead flesh, then the abscess is serious, large, and hard, and is embedded within a quantity (or, localized in a specific area).
But if it is due to wind (gas), then touching it is painless.
And the procedure for it is to consider if the swelling around the navel is due to blood from an arrow wound, or a vein, or wind;  then you must avoid treating it, because there is danger and fear, just as taught in the chapter where I described abscesses from arrow wounds and vein damage.
And if the swelling of the navel is due to intestine or hernia, then you must order the patient to hold their breath, and be standing upright; and then gently probe around the entire navel with a probe, and then order them to lie face down between your hands on their sides, and then carefully encircle the area around the navel, on the spot you marked with the probe, with a wide spatula;  and then dissect (or open) the half of the abscess outward with a large scalpel; and then bind/seal the circumference with a strong thread or bandage, and make a fitting bandage.
And then, cut (or incise) the middle of the extended abscess along the ligament, and insert your finger into that incision and search for the intestine; and if you find it or have grasped it with the ligament, then you remove the obstruction and push the intestine back into the belly cavity.
And if you have found the hernia, then grasp it with a scalpel; and cut away the excess tissue.
But if it is an arrow wound or vein injury, then circle that area, and return to your procedure; and take two needles and place strong threads on them, and insert the two needles into the circumference you have made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you will have to pierce; and then press the abscess into four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the protruding flesh softens and falls away on its own; or cut it when it is softened and can be removed, and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if the swelling at the navel is of flesh formed there or from moisture, then it is necessary that you drain the abscess as we have said and remove the blood or moisture that you find there, and then treat it with what is appropriate and causes the area to consolidate.
Chapter 53.
Of the treatment of cancer.
We have already discussed, in the division, the types of cancer and how it is treated with medicine, and that cutting it with iron is harmful because it causes ulceration; and we have mentioned cancer originating in the breast and precautions for its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its removal is possible, like cancer in the breasts or thigh, and similar locations on the limbs, where everything should be removed, especially when it is small and in its early stages.
But when it is old and severe, one should not attempt to remove it oneself, for I have not been able to cure it nor have I seen another who has, nor is it possible.
And the operation for it, when it is located as we have said, is that you should first let the patient rest and purge them of black bile sometimes, and then bleed them if a clear accumulation is found.
Then prepare the patient with preparations appropriate to the location of the operation, and then insert hooks into the wound, which are necessary for it; and then excavate from all sides with a sharp, good spatula to thoroughly explore until no trace of the roots remain. And allow the blood to flow, and do not cut it lightly, and squeeze the locations, and clean away the thick blood with your hand or with any instrument you can use.
But if you encounter difficulty with thick blood, incision of a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the flow of blood stops, and then treat it with the other cure until it is healed.
Chapter 144.
Of the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy of the water, and the signs of each type, concerning the treatment of them with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of 'althitas' alone, and it is not appropriate to use iron for the type of 'timpanistres' or the type of 'yposarcha', for that is fatal.
And when you have treated this type of tympanistres dropsy with medicines and your treatment does not yield results, then consider: if the patient has already been weakened, or has another illness, another type of dropsy, such as if it is in their chest or abdomen and similar to those, then be careful not to treat them with iron, for there is fear of that.
But if you see the patient with exuberant vigor, and it is only dropsy and no other illness, and the patient is neither a child nor an old person, then the method of their operation is that you lift the patient up between your hands, and the attendant should press the patient's abdomen with their hand, forcing the water towards the lower part of the abdomen, and then take a spiny substance in this way:
It should be of two sharp parts, long, with a sharp tip like a spiny substance; however, there should be some small shortness on it, so that in the operation with it you do not pierce the intestines and damage them.
And now consider if the dropsy originates from the intestines, for then you must, with your incision, move away from the navel by about three fingers towards the lower parts, on the right side of the abdomen above the groin.
But if the dropsy originates from a liver ailment, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the left.
And your incision should not be on the side on which the patient intends to lie, so that the excess fluids are not drawn to that confined area.
And then pierce the entire membrane with the instrument, and then insert your hand into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the membrane and the substance, and scrape that; and if it is the thickness of a nail or about.
And then pierce the substance until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the space of the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the shape: and it resembles a thin silver tube; it is made of silver or brass or lead, on which at the lower end of it is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and its end is fashioned in a pen-like manner, like this:
And on its highest end is a small arm, for when the instrument reaches the water, that immediately falls over the instrument, then evacuates a medium amount of water, because if you evacuate more than is necessary at that time, the patient is quickly killed due to a resolution of their vital spirit, or an approach to death.
But evacuate it according to its virtue and according to the indications given to you by the patient's constitution, the strength of their pulse, and their overall condition.
And then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water, the reason for this being that it is immediately retained by the cord which holds the hole above the membrane, of which I have already told you how to pierce it in this manner.
And then repeat the procedure on another day, if the patient tolerates it, and remove a small amount of water.  Do this for several days cautiously, and beware of error until only a small amount of water remains.
However, if you fear for the patient, and leave a large amount of water, then treat that with burial in hot sand, and promote perspiration in a bath, and wait a long time in the sun; and treat that with drying medicines until it is healed.
And cauterize on the stomach, spleen, and liver after the removal of the water, as I have described in what has gone before.
Chapter 55.
Of the treatment of children born with openings in the urinary tract (not having a closed urethra or other urinary tract openings).
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the opening of its urinary tract is not perforated (or is a narrow passage or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to attempt to perforate it as soon as it is born with a very thin instrument, according to this method:
And then place a thin lead peg in the opening and secure it, and leave it in place for three days or four.
And when it wishes to urinate, it will be removed and it will urinate; and then replace it.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which collects over the area will not allow the opening to close.
But that of which the opening is narrow should be treated with a lead peg, as we have said, for several days until it is widened.
However, in those cases where the opening is not in its proper place, as mentioned, the cause of which is that the opening is near the tip of the penis, so that it cannot urinate, the patient must raise the penis with his hand until it is in the correct position; and this is not natural, because the semen cannot reach the mother properly, and is a very slow ailment.
And the method of the operation in this case is that the patient should be placed on their back, and then you should pull the head of the penis with your left hand with forceful extraction, and cut the head of the penis from the area of the foreskin with a sharp instrument, like a pen-knife, or whatever tool is necessary, so that the opening of the penis returns to the correct position, as it should be.
And be careful, during your operations on bleeding, because this happens frequently; and treat the wound, stopping the bleeding and healing the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Concerning the inflammation that occurs in the foreskin on the head of the penis, and the corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
This inflammation often occurs on the penis and is a swelling of loose flesh.
And of these inflammations, one is malignant and the other is not.
For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a fine instrument and excise the affected area until it is all removed; then place a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment over it; and then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the inflammation is malignant, of a livid color, then you must apply cautery near its incision and its root.
But if the inflammation is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis, and one part of the inflammation is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you must first remove the inflammation that is inside until it is consolidated; and then treat the external part, for if you treat both at the same time, the foreskin might be torn.
And if you observe darkening and corruption in the genitals and foreskin, then you must remove all that is already blackened and about to corrupt or that is already corrupt; and then apply something like honey, mixed with ground pomegranate bark and crushed and sifted herbs, over it.
And then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply a lunar cautery according to this method:
for a helpful cautery is useful in two situations, that is, for a flow of blood and for a sore when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is eroded and completely destroyed immediately, then you must insert a lead cannula into the foreskin's opening so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adherence of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adherence occurs only in those whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required; and when adherence occurs due to a sore or abscess) you must scrape with a blunt instrument until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed completely.
And if it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then you must scrape with a blunt instrument some part of the head of the penis and the foreskin, and this is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is easily perforated by its own thinness.
And then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then treat it with astringent wine until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
Of the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to them during circumcision.
Circumcision is not a simple break in the skin like other wounds; however, since it is a procedure of our doing and our will, and is performed specifically on children, it is necessary to use the best method and easiest path towards a healthful outcome.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not describe circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws.  It is only through experience that we have learned this.  In fact, I have found that most craftsmen and barbers use a razor and tweezers for circumcision and cleansing; and they use a ligature with thread and an incision with a fingernail.
And I have already tested all these methods and find no better cleansing than using scissors, with a thread ligature, than cleansing with a fingernail, because often the foreskin is cut too deeply.  The foreskin has two layers, and the inner layer remains, which forces a further incision and causes unnecessary pain. And using the cleansing method performed by shoemakers, which is digital, is not a safe way to cut the end of the penis, because it is easily possible to cut into the flesh of the penis.
But in the operation with a fingernail, it is easy to cause a bruise and spoil your work. And a child's foreskin is naturally short, and many times it is born in such a way that it doesn't need circumcision, and I have seen that.
But the circumcision done with scissors and thread ligatures, in my experience, is the best, because the scissors allow for a proportionate cut, so that the sharpness on top is similar to the sharpness below; and therefore, when you press your hand, both sharpness are aligned, and a cut is made according to a comparison in one moment; and the thread compression, shaping the foreskin of the penis completely, avoids any mistakes.
And the method of the initial operation is that you should have the child remain mostly still, if it is one who understands a little, so that you only tie the testicles to its penis, and leave it like that until the next day.
And then do whatever pleases it in every way possible, that which receives its intelligence. And then keep it positioned between your hands, properly prepared, and don't be unsteady; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so the child doesn't see them or any other instruments.
And then place your hand on its penis and blow into the sheath, and pull it in so that the head of the penis emerges, and then clean it of any dirt that is stuck to it.
The shape of the scissors for cleaning, this is the shape:
One end should be blunt, and the other sharp, so that the nail's shank doesn't come out, and the length of the two sharpened ends should be approximately the length of two handles together.
But the mistake in cleansing is that you forcibly remove the entire or part of the sheath from around the incision.
Therefore, you should extend that with your fingernail before the abscess is opened and cut it along the line of equality.
And if you can't hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with forceps and cut it.
But if three days have passed, and what's under the foreskin is still swollen after the abscess, then let it be until the hot abscess subsides, and gently peel off the inflamed area, and cut it according to your preparation.
And be careful of the head of the foreskin, for that will not help him.
And then treat that with what consolidates wounds from the powders we have recounted in the treatise on powders.
And if the incision is too deep on the vein, and you injure the parts above, that will not help him.
And further treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Of the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by an obstruction from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a clot, and similar to those things we have mentioned about treatment methods in the division.
And if the urine is not released by what we have said, and the cause is severe in the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument called a syringe, of which this is the form: It should be made of silver, and be a thin, hollow tube, like a bird's quill, with a fine, long ray-like tip resembling a palm and a half, to which a fine tube is attached at its head.
And the method of extracting urine with this is that you take a folded cloth and tie wool or cotton to one end for a good grip; and insert the folded cloth end into the lower part of the syringe, and cut any excess cloth with scissors, but insert it into the tube forcefully.  Then, lubricate the syringe with oil and egg white.
And have the patient lie on their back, and lubricate the patient's bladder and penis with moist oils, such as olive oil and water.
And then insert the syringe easily until it reaches the base of the penis; and then bend the penis upwards towards the navel area; and then push the syringe into that; and then push it further until it reaches the bladder.  And this shows the patient has arrived at the empty cause, and this is not done in this order but in the tortuous channel to the meat.
And then pull out the cloth with the wool slowly, bit by bit, for the urine will moisten the wool.
Then remove it and use the urine for treatment; and continue using the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter .lix.
Of the quality of bladder irrigation with clamps and similar instruments suitable for that purpose.
When there is an ulceration or abscess in the bladder, or congealed blood in it, or a narrowing, and you wish to instill waters and medicines into it, then use an instrument called a clamp-drawer; and this is its form:
but its end is closed, that is, closed. And in that (closed end) there are three holes: two on one side, like times two.
At the beginning, there is a concave space, in which that which is expelled is contained; and it should be proportional to what fills it, without additions, so that when any cause draws the humors out, it is drawn out; and when it is expelled, it is drawn in, and when it is expelled far, according to how a clamp-drawer is used, with which naphtha is put into the battleships at sea.
Therefore, when you want to introduce liquids into the bladder, insert the end of the clamp-drawer into the liquid, and pull with it what is pushed towards the upper parts, for the liquid is drawn into the cavity of the clamp-drawer.
And then insert the end of the clamp-drawer into the penis, as we have recounted in the treatise; and then push the liquid with what you are pushing, for that liquid will reach the bladder immediately, and the patient will benefit from that.
Shape of the subtle instrument with which the bladder is incised, and this is the shape:
And it should be made of silver or bronze, of which the topmost part resembles a small feather, and below it a tube inside a ligament.
And then take a bladder, place the liquid you want to inject into the bladder inside it, tie it tightly between two things with a double bandage, and heat that liquid over the fire.
And then insert the end of the instrument into the penis.
And then hold your hand over the bladder containing the liquid, applying pressure downwards until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it; pierce it all the way through its roundness; and then insert strong thread through those holes, winding it tightly; then attach the circle as it is attached to a bandage, where you put the liquids, oils, and waters you desire.
And then you tie that to the instrument and use it the same way you did with the bladder, and press with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Of the extraction of stone.
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones, their treatment with medicines, the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and stones formed in the bladder, and their symptoms.
And we have discussed the stones in which the operation is done by hand, and by incision.
And the stone formed in the bladder properly is that which is lodged within the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore, I say that stones formed in the bladder mostly affect children; and among their symptoms is that the urine released from the bladder is similar to water in its subtlety, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs their penis frequently and often groans and bends over; and with this, the anus is often squeezed.
And the treatment of children with this condition is easier until they have reached fourteen years of age; and treatment is difficult in the elderly. But in the young it is more manageable because it is among them. (or, more easily handled because it is amongst them).
And for that which has the larger stone, the cure is more straightforward; and if it is small, it is the opposite. (or, conversely).
Therefore, in approaching the cure for this, we must first cleanse the patient with enemas, which remove all the inflammation in their bowels; for that inflammation sometimes prevents the expulsion of the stone, hindering its removal.
And then, the patient should be lifted with their feet and gently shaken and moved around so that the stone descends to the bladder's area, or to a different location in some cases.
And then, place a support between your hands, and the patient's hands should be placed beneath their thighs, so that the entire bladder is tilted towards the lower parts.
And then, extract that and all of it from the outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then you should immediately apply a cut over it.
And if it doesn't completely descend with your touch, then you should lubricate your left index finger (if the patient is a child) or middle finger (if they are an adult) with oil and insert it into their anus. And extract the stone until it is below your finger. And bring it slowly to the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it away from the area where you made the incision.
And command the assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; and command another assistant to, with their right hand, pull the genitals upwards, and with their left hand, hold down the perineum, in the region of the incision.
And then, insert the instrument carefully, the form of which is as follows: And cut between the anus and genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be on that stone, and your finger be in the anus, and let a transverse incision be made, so that the incision outside is wide and inside narrow, according to the amount the stone protrudes into it as possible, and no more, for if you press your finger, which is in the anus, too hard against the stone near the incision, it is forcibly ejected without difficulty.
And know that there is some projection or angle and edges on the stone, which makes the removal of it difficult.
And that which is on top of it resembles a testicle, it is round, and its removal is easy.
Therefore, if it is that which has angles and edges, it should be fitted into the fissure.
And if it is not easily ejected, then you must gently push on it, or press on it with a suitable instrument, the tip of which is like a file with which you press on the stone, and do not push it out; or you must insert a thin curved instrument under it.
But if you cannot push on it, then you enlarge the opening slightly, and if you see blood flowing, bind it tightly with crushed vitriol.
But if the stone is more than one, then at first you push your hand towards the mouth of the bladder, and then cut into it; and then gently push a little further; and similarly do so if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is unwise to cut into it with a large incision, for you cause the patient one of two things: either death or a continuous urine leakage, because the place is not completely healed.
But administer expulsion of it until it is ejected, or use the forceps to break it until it is extracted in pieces.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe juice and dragon's blood, and bind it tightly. And place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in warmed oil and cool water, so that any inflammatory swelling subsides.
And then lay the patient on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you have loosened it, anoint the area with water and oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and diabazilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound there occurs a hot, corrosive, and ulcerative abscess, and it resembles blood congealed in the bladder, and urination is obstructed (and this is known by the blood exiting with the urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it will cause corruption of the bladder and putrefaction from it.
And then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and with whatever else is appropriate for the cure until it is healed.
And throughout the entire healing process, you should bind both the thighs and adjust the medicines that have been placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the urethra, and it is lodged there, and urination is also obstructed, then treat it with what I have recommended before you resort to surgery, for many times this treatment has been accused of being surgery; and I have tested this, and you must take a pointed, iron drill, of which this is the shape:
with a triangular tip, sharp, fitted into a shaft.
And then take a bandage, and bind the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the penis, piercing it easily until the drill reaches that stone. And turn the drill with your hand around that small stone little by little, and enlarge the hole until you make the other side penetrate; for then the urine is immediately released.
And then press your hand on that which is broken off from the stone on the outside of the penis, for it is fractured, and is forced out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not suitable for you for any reason which prevents it, then bind a bandage below the stone, and another bandage above the stone. And then cut around the stone on that penis between the two bandages. And then remove that. And then loosen the bandage and cleanse the congealed blood, which has formed on the wound.
And a bandage below the stone is not necessary, except to prevent it from returning to the bladder; and the other bandage above it is not necessary either, because when the bandage around the stone is loosened, the kidney returns to its place and heals the wound.
Therefore, when you bandage the kidney above, it is necessary for you to raise the kidney upwards, or it will return towards your (intended) position and heal the wound, as we have said.
Chapter 61.
Of the removal of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
But if a stone is found in any of them, then the cure is difficult and is prohibited by many methods.
One of them is because the woman is very young.
And the second is because you don't find a woman knowledgeable enough to recognize the ailment in herself when she is chaste, or if she is a married woman.
The third is that you do not find a woman sufficiently skilled in this art, especially the manual operation.
And the fourth is that the site of incision over the stone in women is distant from the location of the stone, requiring a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
But if necessity compels you to do this, then you should take a skilled female physician, and few are found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a skilled and subtle male physician, or present a matron well-versed in the treatment of women, or a woman who has special expertise in this art.
Therefore, present her, and command her to do everything you order her, from the examination for the stone at the beginning; for this is to verify if the woman is a virgin, then it is necessary that she place her finger into the woman's vagina and seek the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it, she should grasp it under her finger, and then command that she (the surgeon) cut over it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder, and compress it firmly.
Therefore, if she finds it, then she should gradually draw it out from the bladder opening, downwards, using all her strength, until she brings it to the root of the thigh.
And then, cut over that insertion from the middle of the vagina towards the root of the thigh, wherever it is lodged, and extract the stone in that direction, and the woman's finger must not be removed from the grasped stone.
And the incision should be small at first; and then insert the instrument over that incision, and if the stone is felt, then adjust the incision according to the quantity it is known that the stone will be expelled from that opening.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and sharp and rough, and long and round, and having ridges.
Therefore, you know how many types of [things] there are so that you can determine what you want to say about it.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply powdered vitriol to the area and leave it there for an hour until the blood has stopped, and then return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
And ensure that you prepare the instruments, those which are said to be used in the extraction of stones in men, so that you may be aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and know that the expulsion of blood is from the wound that is incised, then you put powder on the area and compress it with a poultice and a tight bandage, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not remove it, for a strong, sudden healing will be needed for the patient. And then treat the wound.
So, when the flow of blood has subsided after a few days, and the area heals, then you return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
Chapter 62.
Of incision on a strangulated hernia.
A strangulated hernia is nothing more than a collection of moisture in the white sac, which is beneath the scrotum containing the testicle, and is called the sac.
And sometimes it is in the proper pouch that nature prepared in the area of the testicle, until it is clear that there is another testicle; and it is the scrotum between the white sac we have mentioned, and this is nothing but a complication.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the testicles, so that this matter is discharged into them, and sometimes it occurs due to a blow inflicted on the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors, for its color is either inclining towards yellow or bloody, or red, or black, or thick and white, and that is all.
And the signs by which it is known where this collection of water is are these: for if it is in the white sac we mentioned, then the abscess is round, sloping slightly lengthwise like an egg shape, and the testicle appears, because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper pouch, then the abscess is round with a part of the testicle and therefore one believes it to be another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the covering of the testicles and the white sac, then it is below the feeling.
And if you want to know the color of the moisture, then you test the color of the moisture in the abscess with a probe whose shape is known beforehand; and according to what comes out on the probe's trail, judge what is within it.
Therefore, when we come to treating it with iron, then it is necessary to order the patient to be bled if this is possible, and to see that their body is full.
And then have them lie on their back on something a little raised, and place soft cloths underneath them.
And then sit on their left side, and tell the assistant to sit on their right side, who should extend their rod to one of two places: the covering of the testicles or the region of the belly button.
And then take a sharp knife and cut the covering of the testicles in the middle lengthwise, almost to the groin.
And let the incision be made following a straight line, equally distant from the line marking the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white, encompassing scrotum.
And scrape that, and observe, and be careful not to cut into that; and your scraping, with which you scrape a portion, should hang from the egg most subtly and examine it with the scraping as much as possible.
And then pierce the water-filled scrotum with a wide opening, and remove all the water.
And then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the scrotum outwards; and do not touch the covering of the testicles, and cut the scrotum in that manner that is possible for you. And cut it completely, or in pieces, and especially its thin edges, for if you do not scrutinize the incision carefully, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
However, if the egg comes out of its covering during your operation, then when you have completed the scrotum incision, return it inside, and then stitch the two lips of the testicles' covering together, and then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels that are on the supporting structure, and remove the testicle, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the fluid is collected in two separate sacs, then know that there are two hernias; thus, cut that part as you did in the other swelling; and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then perform it.
And then you cleanse the wound, and place into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rubbed oil; and place outside another wool soaked in wine and oil, and spread this over the two testicles and the area of the belly; and place over it folded cloths and powders, and tie these over with a bandage in this manner:
And then take two cloths and fill them with woolen lint in this fashion; and make the extremities with which it is pressed from cotton or wet wool, and fix them with a tightening to the breech of the breeches, and one of the extremities reaches from the anus to the groin, and the second goes to the area of the groin, and two extremities above the thighs below and two other extremities above the hips, and all tightening should be adjusted to the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with a cautery instead of cutting with iron; and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin around the genitals with it, and heat it as we have described until the white sac containing the fluid is exposed, and then take a cautery in this form: And it resembles a Greek letter.
And then pierce that sac, and heat it until all the moisture is expelled.
Then spread the sac with hooks, and scrape with hooks, and scrape with a hot, fine cautery; and cut it as much as you can until you eradicate it all; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg [testicle/ovary].
And know that this operation is safer and further from blood loss, and better than an operation with cutting.
However, if you encounter a painful abscess during the incision or cauterization, or blood loss, then it is necessary for you to treat any adverse effect it causes, with treatment that is appropriate for it, as mentioned.
But if the patient is afraid, and does not expect the second operation because of its horror, then administer the puncture as I recommend; and this is when you are certain, by what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is acute.
Then it is necessary for you to place the patient on a raised surface, and pierce the abscess in the lowest part of him with a broad spatula, and place the puncture along the body's length.
And let the opening be wide enough that all the water flows out.
And then place a cloth over the area, and bind it, and leave it, so that the remaining water drains away. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the flow of water at that time, you pierce it further: and this is done because the white skin (pannicol) at the wound's opening resists and prevents the water from escaping. In that case, you must insert a device, or instrument, with which the water from hydrops is extracted, the shape of which has been previously described; or make a small incision in the compression of the wound.
And know that the water returns, and is collected again approximately every six months or thereabouts; and when it is collected, it must be pierced in the same manner, so that the patient will pass through their days.
Chapter 63.
Of the incision on a fleshy hernia and its cure.
Know that in the incision of this hernia, there is a fear of falling into danger in most cases; therefore, I have witnessed the dismissal of it and its salvation by this better method.
And I am recalling the operation on it and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the bodies of those whose vital fluids are congested, and this is caused by many things: either by a sharp, intense superfluity which is poured out into the vital fluids, or by a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and there is no pain in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And a very severe abscess is a petrified one, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by the constriction of the arteries, and by the inflammation of those, so that their recollection is already perceived, or by inflammation of the veins.
But that which is caused by inflammation of the arteries is recognized by the dispersion of the abscess when we compress it with our fingers; and it should not be touched.
But that which is caused by inflammation of the vein is not dispersed by any cause from compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that on this type [of abscess] an incision be made on other tissues; and you must incise the ligament of the genitals, then spread the testicles upwards, and extract it from the white sac, and release the suspensory ligaments, tie them, and incise the suspensory ligaments further, until you release it from all connections to the testicles.
Therefore, if the testicle is already attached to those tissues, then you must extract the testicle and incise it.
And if there is an adhesion to any part of the sac, or between the vessels, then you must release all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the location of the adhesion, which is behind [the testicle], then you must incise all of that, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in warmed oil and wine; then treat it with further remedies until it heals.
Chapter 64.
Of the treatment of inguinal hernias.
The inguinal hernia is characterized by an abscess encapsulated by a swelling similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and making exercise, movement, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in treating this illness, one must fear the things that preceded it, bearing them in mind.
However, it is necessary to describe the operation in the same manner as the first ones.
And I say that it is necessary to make the patient sit on an elevated surface; then, gently push the suspensory ligament of the testicles downward; then hold the scrotum with your fingers and the instruments that you use on the penis;  another assistant should do the same, and stretch them vigorously.
Then, with a sharp, pointed scalpel, make a transverse incision along the course of the veins until the veins are exposed.
And then, scrape away any part, just as we have described in the extraction of arrows from the temples.
Then insert a needle with a double thread into those areas where you encounter the veins, and tie it once around the front of those areas, and tie it again around the back of them. Then, cut them in the middle, making a lengthwise incision along the body, and remove the accumulated putrid and corrupt humors.
And then treat the wound with the remedies for other wounds where suppuration is desired, so that the veins that nourish one of two generative organs are affected.  For that is no harm.
However, if you encounter veins in all parts, then it is necessary to remove the testicles, or that the testicles become blocked with the veins, so that they are deprived of all nourishment through the incision of the veins, and that they are withered or that they become blocked so as to be no longer helpful.
Chapter 65.
Of the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture in the diaphragm stretching over the abdomen, from the angles of the navel's miracle, causing the intestines from that rupture to adhere to some of the other intestines.
And this rupture is either of the diaphragm or of a protrusion from it, and these two types happen due to many causes: either from a blow, or from a jump, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy object, or from similar actions.
And the sign of this, when it is from a stretching of the diaphragm, is that it happens gradually over a long time, and not suddenly, and it forms an abscess inward towards the navel, because the diaphragm compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is from a rupture of the diaphragm, is that at the beginning it causes sudden, intense pain; and it is a diverse, visible abscess under the ribs nearby, and this is because of the expulsion of the intestine, and its body in the parts outside the diaphragm.
And sometimes the membrane is expelled along with the intestine, and this is called an intestinal hernia (or possibly, a "mesenteric hernia" depending on context)
And sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes a hole forms in the intestine, and it is trapped there, and this causes great suffering for the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of these types of illness with iron, there is fear, so that the use of iron should be avoided in that case.
And the method of the operation for this is that you command the patient to push the intestine back into its cavity with their hand if it returns, and then have them lie on their back between your hands, and elevate their legs.
And then hold the scrotum, which is above the testicles, and cut the scrotum all the way lengthwise; and then insert two hooks into the edges of the incision as you need to open the incision with them.
And if the incision, according to the amount that is possible for you, allows the egg to be expelled from it.
And then scrape away that tissue which is underneath the scrotum, until the hard white testicle is exposed on each side.
Then you insert your finger into that which is the testicle, the white tissue that is under the skin of the testicle and between that and the other testicle, and separate the adhesions that are on the back of the testicle.
Then hold the scrotum with your hand on the outside, and with that, lift the white testicle with your left hand, and lift the testicle with the testicle towards the incision; and instruct the assistant to pull the testicle upwards, and you detach the adhesions behind it with a suitable solution.
And use your fingers to check that there is no cause for the intestine to be wrapped around the hard white testicle. But if you find any such cause, then you push it back into the abdomen.
And then make an incision in the area beneath the skin of the testicles, so that blood and pus flow out, as we have described previously.
Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound; and apply the bandage we have described (and sometimes the white testicle is cauterized, as mentioned near the incision to prevent excessive bleeding, for often this happens).  Leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
But if the swelling is delayed, then use warm water compresses and apply them until it falls off, as we have described.
And then treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of the windy hernia.
In this hernia, I have not seen anything that has been cured by burning it with iron.
And the first [doctors] would say that it is done thus, as we have recounted in the hernia that is with wine; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision upon it with ease; and then dry the middle area around the abscess with that which opens it, until the vessels fall away.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the disruption that occurs in the joints.
Sometimes there is a rupture in the joints, as we have said, and you should remove the affected area.
And do not leave any cause of the intestines in the genitals; and if they do, it is little; and it returns at all times.
But if the time is prolonged with this, a fissure is made in the groin until the intestine descends into the groin; and this occurs because of the extension of the groin which is in the joints, as we have said, which causes the groin to be stretched, and then softened, and the area becomes infected, and you remove it.
And the treatment for it is with cautery, as is previously described.
And sometimes it is cured with an iron according to this method: and it is that the patient lies on their back between your hands, and then dries the area of the rupture of the abscesses, removing it with a cut along the breadth according to the amount of three days.
And then stretch the white groin (or flesh) that is under the groin until it is exposed.
And then take the reed and place it on the prominent area of the groin, and press it against the front of the abdomen.
And then sew the two prominent areas on the extremity of the groin's reed (or tissue), and join one of them to the other with stitches.
And then remove the extremity of the reed, and do not cut the groin completely, nor extend the (hernia) sac, nor any other such thing, as I have told you in the treatment of an intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment of ulcers, and as you would cleanse and restore an ulcer until it is healed; for the groin is constricted and the rupture prominence is not aligned.
Cauterization is better in this location, for it is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
Of softening the hardening of the testicles.
Often the hardening of the testicles in some men is softened by this, because the flesh surrounding them is softened, and it is trusted that it will work.
Therefore, it is necessary for whoever is entrusted with the cure to have the patient lie down according to their side, and to carefully remove all the hardened tissue that has softened over the natural testicle; and then to stitch together the two edges with sutures.
And if you wish, stitch the excess softened tissue at the beginning with three or four stitches, using firm sutures.
And then, drain between the sutures; and then treat with healing remedies for other sores until it is healed and the pus subsides.
Chapter 69.
Of castration.
Know that castration, in our laws, is forbidden, but by reason of necessity, it is proper for me to include it in this book; and its mention is not needed except in two ways.  One is that it falls within the knowledge of the physician to be questioned on it, so that he might know the cure for it when it occurs. The other way is that we often have need of castrating other animals for our own benefit, as with oxen, goats, pigs, and similar beasts.
Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing, or by slitting and cutting.
However, in that which is done by crushing, the method is to place the animal in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. And then grasp them with your hand until they are broken and no longer appear beneath the touch.
But in castration performed by slitting and cutting, you must hold the animal and press the scrotum with your left hand.
And then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut on each testicle with a cut until both testicles are separated.
And then cut them further, once you have each peeled away the skin. And do not leave any cause of the sheath, except the subtle sheath that is upon the vessels.
And this method of castration, done by crushing, is better, for a strong crush leaves no cause in the testicles for the animal to desire copulation.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Of the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when there is a visible space in the scrotum, between the testicles,  shaped like a woman's vulva, with hair on it.
And sometimes urine flows from the area between the testicles.
But in women it is a different type:  it is when the woman's vulva is, in a way, like two testicles of a man, slightly extending outward like the penis of a man, and [with] two testicles.
And the treatment is of three types: for two types in men and one type in women. And you must cut through those adhering flesh until the swelling subsides, and then treat them with the same remedies as other sores.
And in the second type of men's ailment, where there is urine in the groin area of the testicles, there is no cure nor operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Of tumors and prominent flesh due to causes related to women.
A mild tumor, if it is caused by natural reasons and is restricted and easily managed, sometimes grows significantly in some women, spreading as widely as it does in men and leading to difficulties in sexual intercourse.
Then you should hold the excess tumor with your hand or forceps and cut it.
And do not overdo the incision, especially at the root of the tumor, so that you do not cause excessive bleeding.
And then treat it with the treatment for wounds until it is healed.
But flesh that arises within the mother's womb, filling it, and then erupts through the body in the shape of a tail (and for this reason some earlier physicians called this "tail disease"); therefore, you should cut it like you would cut a tumor and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
Of the treatment of dropsy.
Dropsy is when the vagina of the woman is not perforated, or the opening is small. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to an illness that has preceded it, and this is caused either by improperly joined flesh or by a subtle or thick membrane.
And it is located either in the mother's womb, or in her ribs, or in the upper part of her, or in the lower part of her, and you prohibit food and drink and childbirth, and strongly prohibit menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by observation of the midwife, if the blockage is apparent, immediately; but if it is not apparent, then you seek it with your fingers or with the rod.
But if the blockage is due to a thin membrane, and it is close to the two lips, then you cut and break it open.
And it is that you place powders on the two lips, and then place your index fingers of both hands on top.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs extended, and then forcefully extend the two lips until that thin membrane is broken and the blockage is opened.
Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it over the area.  Let the person rest with a covering over it during the day to prevent the wound from healing too quickly.
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then you must cut it with a sharp knife or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the blockage is due to a clot, then suspend it with a hook and cut it.
And have with you the medicines that stop blood flow without causing a bite, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and gum arabic, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal too quickly.
And keep it for a few days and administer poultice of the same.
And then be treated with the other healing treatment for consolidation until it is healed.
And sometimes it spreads to other tissues, and then it is necessary to cut according to this method. But if this is due to a brain abscess, a brain abscess that is in the head should not be treated with any iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids and of tail and red swelling that occurs in the female perineum.
Hemorrhoids are understood as the openings of many veins through which a continuous flow of blood runs; and when hemorrhoids are old and they are (or have been) made into prolapses (or have prolapsed).
And I have already discussed the types of those and their signs, and I will now say which of them receive treatment and which do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and prolapses, when they are in the rectum and not apparent to the touch, then in those cases no treatment with iron should be performed.
But those which are in the opening of the rectum and are felt, are those that are treatable.
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a cold place and then carefully cut the prolapsed area with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them at the roots.
Then, sprinkle over them the flow of blood from one of the incised powders, without biting, like acacia and similar substances.
And then you should immerse their feet in a basin of cold water for an hour, and then place the affected area in cool water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make a poultice using a decoction of the tops and bark of pomegranates, and quinces, and similar substances.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine, and make a poultice with this and apply it to their back.
And if the blood has stopped, good; but if not, apply two leeches, and to the nipples without incision.
Then take wool and immerse it in coriander juice, or juice of arugula, or juice of rue mixed with diluted wine, and apply it to the affected area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the accidental perforation of the eyssedura (likely meaning the eustachian tube) in the ear.
Many kinds of abscesses may occur in the ear, such as cancer, stony abscess, ulcers, boils, eruptions, fistulas, hemorrhoids, sores, and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these illnesses and their types, their signs, and their treatments in the division.
And I must discuss in this treatise the abscess that arises in the ear when it is among the abscesses that collects pus, and if you wish to know how its surgical operation is performed with an iron tool.
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is sharp with throbbing, phlegm, and fever, and if it shows redness and if touching it feels hot, then do not proceed with puncturing it, and treat it with things that aid maturation until the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
And then you must lay the woman on a table with two supports; and incline her on her back and adjust her feet to the part below her abdomen, and her thighs should be spread out, and place her arms below her elbows, and bind each with a bandage suitable for this purpose.
And then the midwife, standing to the right side, should administer the instrument with which the opening in the womb is made; the shape of which will be seen in the upcoming details.
And when you wish to administer this instrument, you should insert the tip of the instrument into the womb of the woman, and what of the instrument enters the womb should only be the tip, and ease the patient's suffering. But if the instrument is larger than the opening of the womb, then you must place powders on the tissues of the womb, so that the entrance of any instrument into the womb is prevented.
And you must place the rotating part of the instrument on the top, and the assistant should hold the instrument and turn the rotating part until the opening of the womb is made.
And when the discharge appears, and is touched with the hand and is slimy and wet, then you must dry that around the patient's head with a linen cloth.
And when the discharge is evacuated, then you should place a cloth soaked in rosemary oil or green oil (in which there is some astringent substance) on the wound, and apply the compress to the area in the womb.
And place outside the womb, and over the perineum, a clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And then it should be treated for about two days with an ointment appropriate for this until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed in such a way that it is cleansed with water and honey, and then with water in which lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled, and then it returns to the ointment.
And if the wound is hidden inside the womb, then you should be prohibited from treating it with iron, and instead treat it with what we have described in the division.
Chapter 75.
To teach the midwives how to treat living embryos when their development is not natural.
A necessary thing is that the midwife know the natural form of childbirth by its signs.  When you see the woman pushing from below and desiring to breathe air, and this is relieved by what is upon her during delivery, and hastens the expulsion of the embryo, then know that this birth is in a natural form; and the expulsion is of the child above its head and the afterbirth either hanging or suspended from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, then the abdomen should be pressed so that the embryo descends easily; for when it descends headfirst, it leaves behind the afterbirth, and it is cleaned of those superfluities with a good cleaning.
But that which is different from this birth is unnatural and undesirable, for when the embryo is expelled feet first, and its body comes out before its head and feet, or its one hand, or foot, or its head and hand, or its belly, and its head is strongly bent over its neck, and its form is of an unnatural and undesirable type.
Therefore, a necessary quality for the midwife is to be knowledgeable and astute in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what skill is within them so that it may be understood and be established upon them.
When the birth has occurred headfirst through natural expulsion, and this is difficult for the woman and taxing on her, and her strength is already weakened, then apply this poultice, or what women use, and vaporize its head with collected fenugreek and with moist oils.
And then the midwife should insert her fingers into the small space and fissure with it the afterbirth, or sever it with her fingernail until she removes whatever moisture is within it. And press on the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman must be treated with a poultice of plantain and a poultice of fenugreek with cumin.
And then command him, then the attendant, to be compressed and cause him to sneeze with spices; and cover his mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled shortly.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at first, then you must gently reduce them bit by bit. But if you do not succeed in the procedure, then place the woman on a table and raise her feet up, and then tilt the table towards the ground; and hold the woman so she does not fall during the tilting.
And if the hands are not returned and the fetus dies, then cut them open and extract the remains of the fetus, or bind the body to the patient's hand with cloth, and extract it with gentleness, for that will be expelled.
When the fetus is on its feet, then you must push them up, then gently turn the fetus, and then gently swallow it, and then take one foot and extend it slowly.
But when it has emerged into the thighs, then you command the person to cough, and make them sneeze with diligence, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recounted, then you return the fetus slowly until you put it back in its natural position, for it will then be expelled with easy delivery.
And if it is still not expelled by all that we have described, then take marshmallow root and dissolved gum, and pound them thoroughly in a mortar, then apply this mixture to the vulva, to the lowest part of her abdomen. And then apply this compress in lukewarm water, until the hypochondria is relieved.
And when the parts below her are soothed, then apply a fumigation of myrtle and place it over her. And when the fumigation has been applied for an hour, then you make her sit on a cushion, and then make her sneeze and compress her mouth, and remove it, and press the lowest part of her abdomen gently, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
The fetus emerges lengthwise, hanging from one of her hands. Be skillful in reducing the hand of the patient, but if you cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
And if walking is not possible, then have her lie on the bed, and forcefully compress her thighs, and then administer bandages soaked in mucilages.
And if labor has begun, then have her sit on a stool, and then carefully study the reduction of the hand, and pull the fetus into a natural position, and make the woman sneeze and tell her to push until it is expelled.
The fetus is positioned on the mother's pubic area, its hands and face are on her abdomen. The midwife should hold the baby's hand and carefully turn it slowly and gently.
And when it is pulled out, then place on its head what we have mentioned of oil and mucilages.
And then instruct her to move slightly, and when you have done this, have her sit on a stool and tell her to lean to her right side, and then instruct her to push; and make her sneeze with moderation. The prepared fetus is positioned on its side.
When the mother stops having contractions in this manner, consider it, and then you cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until the moisture is expelled.
And if the fetus is hanging from the face and neck, then you cut that from the umbilical cord, so that it is not retained and dies.
Then push the fetus in the directions inside until you place it as it should be, and tell the woman to push herself a few times, and it will be expelled easily, if God wills it.
Delivery of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born quite often, and sometimes three or four, but this is unusual and rarely happens; but various things are outside of nature, and not alive.
And count them, whether they are multiplied, a second, and they are separated by a cipher, distinguishing them between the ligament in the navel of each of them. And sometimes they are expelled as one fetus is by a similarly easy natural way, and sometimes it happens by an unacceptable way as we have recounted.
And if some of them are difficult during childbirth and reach the point we have mentioned about unnatural formations, then you should treat them as we have described.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and subtlety, and with patience, and is ingenious according to every figure, according to what is prepared for her by the guiding intelligence to lead to health.
A recollection of what is formed in the womb from embryos and miscarriages.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even ten are formed in the mother's womb.  I have personally verified that one woman miscarried six, and another ten, all formed, the cause of which was determined through the measurements of the learned and glorious.
And all of this must be within the midwife's knowledge, for it is easily recognized by the small signs of it, and therefore one must act accordingly.
Chapter 76.
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with what we have discussed in the division of medicine, and it hasn't emerged naturally, and you are forced to use manual intervention, then you must consider if the woman is of sound constitution and not afflicted by any of the conditions that cause fear of her loss.
Then the woman must be positioned on the bed on her back, and her head should be inclined downward and her thighs raised.
And the attendant should hold either part of her or tie her to the bed so that her body doesn't move away during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you should moisten the mother's mouth with soothing oils and with mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then the midwife should anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and then gently introduce her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the place where she can hook her fingers into the fetus.
And suitable places for this: then consider if the fetus is positioned so its head is downward, and then hook your fingers into its neck, or into its mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or in the fork of the jaw, or in the appropriate areas of the ribs, or below the armpits.
But if the descent is towards the feet, then in the groin, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary to hold the finger with the right hand, and place the curve of the finger in that place which is between the fingers of the left hand, and gently introduce the hand and place the fingers in any of those places we have mentioned, until reaching the empty space.
And then place and hook another finger, or a third if necessary, so that there is a pulling inwards, and not an outward extension merely along its own path.
And it should be moved in all directions, so that the extraction of it is eased, just as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary in the area between them that the extension be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil and insert those fingers and turn around that which is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the fet is forced out, then the fingers should be moved to a higher location; and do this until all the fet is expelled.
But if the hand is pulled out before the other, and it is not possible to return it by constriction, then a cloth should be wrapped around it; and then pull it out until it is all expelled, and cut it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus you should do for the other hand and the two feet.
But if the head of the fet is large, or constriction occurs during the expulsion, or fluid is collected at its head, then it is necessary to insert fingers between the spinal vertebrae and to break the head open and drain the fluid, or to cut it with an instrument called "alundat," the shape of which will be found with the shapes of other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
And similarly, do so if the fet has a large head by nature:  and then it is necessary to cut it with a scalpel, or to grasp it with an alundat as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is protruding and constricted towards the fork, then it should be split open until the moisture in the foot is expelled.
But if it is not complicated, nor obstructing the expulsion, then you cut the head as soon as possible.
And if the lower part of the abdomen is abscess-ridden or hydrops, then you must pierce it until the moisture within is drained.
But if the fet is on its feet, then the traction of it is gentle and its direction towards the mother's mouth is gentle.
But if it is constricted towards the belly and the foot, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and cut open the belly and the foot until that which is within them runs out.
But if the other limbs are removed and the head is still there, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she should insert her hand into the vagina, and search for the head with it, and pull it towards the mother's mouth with her fingers, and then insert a finger, or two fingers, into it and pull it with them.
And if the mother's mouth is obstructed by a hot abscess which affects the opening, then it should not be roughly treated.  Instead, a poultice of fatty, moist substances should be applied. And apply poultices; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, if possible, it should be turned: and what we have said about a living fetus should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And you must not leave any cause inside the afterbirth.
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer what we have said about the treatment of boils, which sometimes occur in the mother.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then immerse it in astringent waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have already seen a woman in whose womb a stillbirth had occurred, and shortly after that fire again became pregnant, and shortly after the stillbirth happened again. A long time ago, an abscess occurred near his navel; and it became swollen until it was opened, and it began to discharge pus.
And I was called to treat him, and I medicated him for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
Then I applied some strong-drawing plasters to him, and a bone came out of him, and after a few days another bone came out; and I was very surprised, as there are no bones in the belly.
And then I thought that they were bones from the stillborn child.
Then I cleaned the wound, and removed many bones from him.  The woman, who was in good health in other ways, lived in this condition for a long time, but only a little pus was discharged.
And I did not consider this strange, because it is knowledge and aid to what the skillful physician uses in their treatment.
Of the forms of instruments needed to extract the fetus.
Method of turning with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of a tightening device where the books are bound, to which binding are two turns at the two ends of two pieces. However, this turning needs to be more subtle than a tightening device, and should be made either of a reed or of wooden stick.
And let the width of each piece be two fingers and the margin of each be one finger, and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle place of the two pieces are two attachments of the same pieces, which are already fastened, whose length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two attachments are inserted into the mouth of the mother so that it is opened by them when you turn the two prescribed turns.
Another form similar to that, more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of reed wood or wood, resembling forceps. However, at its extremity there are two attachments, just like before, and the length of those attachments is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with them, then you have the woman lie on the bed with her feet hanging down, opening the area between her thighs. And then open your hand with the instrument, just as you would with scissors,  according to the amount you want to expand the opening of the mother's passageway, until the midwife accomplishes what you wish.
The method of turning, which the ancients said:
Method of pushing by which the fetus is pushed.
Method of assisting with which the large head is delivered.
And it is similar to forceps, which has teeth at the extremity, as sometimes, and sometimes it is made long, like forceps of this form, as sometimes, which has teeth like saw teeth with which it is incised and delivered. Method of gentle assistance.
Method of using a hook having a spine (or point).
Method of using a hook having two spines (or points).
Method of a spatula with two extremities, with which the head is severed.
Method of two wide spatulas.
All those instruments, the more numerous the types and the better they are prepared by the artisans, the easier they are to use and the more beneficial they are to people.
And do not neglect these instruments, wherever they may be, and be prepared for them, for the need for these is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the second [thing/part/item].
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should instruct the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with some means, and firmly press your hand over her mouth and nose; and if by this it comes out, it is good.
And if not, then you take a bowl, and make a hole in its cover, and place in it herbs such as rue, anise, chamomile, Arabic cicadas, cinnamon, and centaury, placing the bowl over the mother's open mouth, as a poultice. All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the bowl, and place that over the fire.
And then place a reed tube in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's cavity.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and it hasn't been expelled, then you order the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mixture, and then insert that into the vagina and try to remove the afterbirth with it.  And when you have found it, take it and pull it out slowly.  But if it's attached to the mother's womb, then insert her hand as we have described, and when she has located the afterbirth, extract it little by little, as instructed, so that the mother does not experience a violent pull. Beforehand, it is necessary that it be moved easily from the right and left sides.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already described the treatment with sneezing and with medicinal poultices of herbs.
But if it is not expelled by all the methods we have described, then beware of exhausting it further by continued attempts to remove it. Instead, it is necessary that what has been expelled from her into the mother's mouth be placed on the woman's thigh, and then treat it with unguents and tetrapharmacon.  For this will cause it to decompose over several days and dissolve, and thus be expelled.
However, when it decomposes, a foul odor rises to the head and stomach, and this afflicts the patient; and then it is necessary to administer fumigations and remedies appropriate to this.
However, some of the ancients already tested fumigations with juniper and dried figs.
Shape of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated for the retention of menstrual blood and the afterbirth:
It should be made of glass or brass.
And place the thin end in the container and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation material should be placed on the embers of the fire.
And keep it there until the fumigation is consumed and put in another.
Of the treatment of the unperforated anus of the child.
Many children are born with their anuses unperforated, which are already narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that narrowing with her finger; and if not, pierce it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the rectum.
And then place over it wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to swallow.
And blockage of the anus may occur due to the consolidation of a plague or an abscess; then it is necessary that that consolidation be incised, and then be treated with what we have said about the treatment and lead.
Of the treatment of the fistulas that arise from there.
Fistulas that form in the lower region,  owing to a swelling and thickening, which form near the anus externally or in the space between the buttocks.
And it is a fistula or abscesses.
And when that swelling is longstanding and oozes a watery, whitish fluid or a subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are also deep-seated.
And those deep-seated ones are recognized by what comes out of them, by the discharge and by the windiness; and sometimes the patient has a discharge, and often worms come out of them.
And sometimes these fistulas extend into the bladder, and into the urethra; and some of these deep ones extend into the joint of the thigh and into the groin area.
And how a deep-seated fistula in the anus is distinguished from a non-deep-seated one is that you insert your index finger into the anus, and gently probe for a thin rod of a ramrod or iron in the fistula if there is no obstruction.
But if there is an obstruction in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you feel nothing at all, and there is no discharge of any kind, either worms or windiness, as we have said, then know that it is not deep-seated, and therefore your treatment is appropriate.
And when the fistula extends into the bladder or into the urethra, then its sign is the presence of urine from there, and a prohibition of urination until the area is healed with medicine.
But if it extends into the hip joint or into the bone, and there is pain in the surrounding area, then its sign is that the probe penetrates there, if there is no obstruction into the bone, and pain in the surrounding area; and that it is likely to remain this way; and that no medication will be effective or will heal with ointment.
And in all those deep-seated fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the treatment for them is the labour and vanity of foolish doctors, upon which one should not rely.
But in those that are not deep-seated and not long-standing, healing with iron is expected, as I will tell you, and this I have already tried and proven.
And it is necessary that the patient lies on their back with their legs raised upwards, their thighs bent towards their stomach, and then carefully insert a lead probe, or an iron one if there is a bend in the fistula, until you know the exact spot where the probe penetrates.
And if the pain is around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe already penetrating on your finger, or if you feel something between your finger and the tissue or flesh, then know for certain that it is deep-seated; and then do not work on it, for there is no cure in such a case, as we have said.
But nevertheless, some might say that it heals in some men slowly.
And the treatment by which healing is expected is that you heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as previously described, and insert that heated cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all the inflamed flesh and fistula-like tissue which resembles a bird feather quill are now cauterized.
And then treat it with some bandages until all the cauterized flesh is healed, and then treat it with medicines that generate and solidify flesh.  If it is healed, well and good; but if not, then it will not be healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate to your finger in the anus, and between the probe and that is a thick layer of flesh or tissue, and the fistula is on the surface of the hard skin, then cut the hard skin at the beginning of the fistula, and you should cut with the probe, and move it in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the end of the probe reaches, and by the probe, it is freed and extracted.
And then clean those fistula-like tissues, which are like a bird feather quill, and no trace of them remains.
But if blood flow occurs between you and your procedure when you cauterize those tissues, then the best and most immediate instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, for cauterization with fire has two good effects: it is the cauterization of the inflamed tissues and the excision of the blood, removing the moisture.
And then treat it with bandages or a crushed cloth until the wound is closed, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate hard flesh.
And these medicines, which involve astringency and excision, when then restored, are healed and you need not fear a recurrence.
But if the fistula has already reached the anus and is distant from the body's surface, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it with that.
And therefore, if you feel resistance and between you and it is a layer of phlegm or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation there, but rather a treatment through trust and hope.
This condition can be addressed in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or excise it until you achieve its cavity, so that you can insert remedies and the treatment is effective; and do not proceed too much with excision, so that you do not cut the ligament that contains the bowel, and that would lead to harming the patient unintentionally; and then treat it as we have said, for a quick cure will result; or separate the membrane and clean the pus that you dry with excision near the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or with another instrument with a sharp tip, and then clean the fistulous flesh which is in the excision, until you can treat it with a scab; and then strive to restore the entire wound with excision, and if the orifice above is not healed, and the fistula remains open in the anal region, it will be less arduous for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is cured in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is located in the folds of the anus near the body's surface, with the curve and at the margin of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like a needle used to prepare skin in this manner:
and insert into that a probe wrapped in five probes or around those; and then insert a probe with a probe inside the fistula until you reach its cavity.
However, if it is penetrating at the margin of the anus near the inside, then you withdraw the probe from that opening as if you were inserting your finger into the anus; and withdraw the tip of the probe and join the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it for one or two days. And when you further cut the probe into the flesh, tightly hold it until the flesh that is between the two ends of the probe is cut and falls away.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, but not too much into the peritoneum, for it is not up to you to do that so as not to cut the intestines; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the spatula with which the fistula is opened: the curvature of which is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so as not to cut what is not necessary, just as sometimes happens.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows in the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds, for either they are between the buttocks, similar to bunches of grapes, or they are like clusters of grapes. And of those, some are small and some large, and the blood flows from them constantly, and some are one, and some are many, and some are outside the anus, and on its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the measures of little moisture, from which flows yellowish water or a little blood with continuous matter, and it is according to the color of the matter.
And the treatment for those that are inside the anus is to order the patient to sit and press until the anus opens and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you grasp and lift them with tweezers or your fingernails, and then cut them away from their roots.
However, if the tweezers are not holding them because of their moisture and softening, then take them with a rough cloth or cotton or a piece of wool, and remove them with your fingers, and then cut them and sprinkle some warm powders over the incisions, so that they are there instead of cauterization; or cauterize them as is previously described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
And if the anus does not open, then prick the patient with a pricker in which there is a small bite, and wash with what is in the anus, so that it opens easily when the patient presses.
However, if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and you should grasp them with your fingernail, or with tweezers, cut them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And whoever has made the incision, must stitch them using this method: take a thin thread and thread it through a needle, then pull the hemorrhoids apart, and using the needle, pierce into the root of the other side, and wrap the two ends of the thread along the lower part of the needle, in a horizontal manner. Then tightly constrict the hemorrhoid with the stitch, and afterwards tie the thread and remove the needle.
Do this to all of them, and leave one unsewn, so that the excess blood can flow from it.
Then place a cloth soaked in rubbed oil or ointment on the anus; place it over the anus and tell the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls out; and when it has fallen out, treat it with ointments or other remedies until it is healed.
And if they are old and do not respond to that medicine, then you should scrape them with the tip of a spatula or your fingernail until they are moist and the scab of pus above them is removed, which prevents their consolidation; then treat them until they are consolidated.
Then you scrape them with a more forceful scraping than the first until much blood is drawn and they are raw; then treat them until they are healed.
Know that elephantiasis, that is to say, a key (or important) issue, and is not otherwise known, is a reddish swelling like a nail head, and it forms on the whole body, especially in the parts below the feet and on the legs, and it is caused by that swelling.
And then it is necessary to cut that which is around the swelling, and hold it with scissors or forceps, and uproot it from its root; and then treat that.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is previously described in its chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, fistulous, round protuberance on the body's surface, and often appears on the hands of children.
And its treatment is to scrape and cut it, or to squeeze it with a file or a peel until it bursts. And if you wish, cauterize this, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.
But a pimple is a small, rough, or fistulous, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, often appearing on the face, and when the cold encounters it, it is felt like an ant bite, and forms around the body.
And the treatment for it is to take a hollow tube made of a bird's feather or a vulture's feather, strong, and place it over the pimple until the tube encircles the area of the pimple; then rotate your hand with the tube until it cuts through whatever is around the pimple, and press it into the flesh, eradicating the pimple from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a tube of bronze or iron in this way:
Let the part above the tube be thin, closed (meaning not perforated), wrapped so that the grip on it is shortened and its rotation is easier.
And if you wish, cauterize the pimple as previously described in the section on cauterizing boils in the chapter on cauterization.
Concerning the instruments used for administering this treatment.
Sometimes cauterization is done with silver or brass or cast or hammered bronze; and sometimes it is done with instruments small and large, according to those for which they are administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose buttocks are sore or painful, the cauteries for those should be small.
The form of large and small cauteries:
The head of the cannula above, on which the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and there should be a clear distinction where the bag is tied, just as usual.
And the lower end, which is inserted into the buttock, should be closed (that is, not open) very tightly, gradually tapering to a thin point; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the holes should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little bigger than the smallest.
And the bag, in which the medicines for the bladder of an animal or sheepskin are placed, should be a palm in width.
And it should be pierced with many holes, just as it is rolled; and if the space between the holes is the width of a finger.
And then insert into those holes a strong, thick, crude (or perhaps, "raw")  bile, amounting to ten parts or roughly so; and attach that to the bag; and when the bag is placed in position, tightly bind the top of the crutch (or "stick") between two distinguishing points with strong constriction, and then bind each hole with it.  However, the technique of binding with this is that you fill the bag with medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
And now the patient should lie on their back, raise their legs, and place a cloth underneath them, perhaps a sheet or blanket; and then anoint the end of the cautery with oil or egg white or with mucilage of fenugreek or similar; and then insert this into the buttock with ease.  Then the attendant should take the bag and squeeze it with both hands forcefully until everything contained in the crutch has been evacuated into the bowel; then remove the crutch and let the patient lower their legs to the side.
And if the medicine causes expulsion in this way, hold it in place for as long as possible; and if they sleep with it all through the night, it is better for healing.
However, if you use this crutch in cases of loose bowels and expulsion from the body, then you repeat the cautery until it is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or festering sores in the buttock, then the crutch should be very small and slender, like those used to treat children.
Of the treatment of plagues.
I have already said in the division of the treatment of plagues what was appropriate for the book, and I say thus about the treatment of those with hands and medicines according to the fulfillment.
Therefore, I say that plagues are diversified according to where the plagues are caused and according to the location on which the plagues fall.
And the causes why plagues are often inflicted are like throwing stones, or cutting with a sword or knife, or striking with a lance, or with a staff, or with an arrow, or similar to those from many causes.
But the plagues that are on the parts of the body are like a plague that falls on the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the liver, and similar to those of the limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of some plagues, so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other plagues.
And I will begin with the simple plagues of the head, for the remembrance of the compounded ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple plague occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is from throwing a stone or similar, and only the scalp is broken and it is a severe wound, and you fear the onset of a hot abscess in that patient, then you should quickly perform phlebotomy on the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and draw blood from him according to his strength, unless some other cause prevents phlebotomy, especially if the blood that has come out of the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the affected part; and protect the patient from repletion and from heavy foods and drinks.
But if some cause prohibits the reduction of food, then reduce the amount of food and do not allow him to eat meat or drink wine.
And if an abscess develops on the wound, apply a poultice of softened oil or wine with a styptic agent.
But if a hot abscess is certain, then apply to the wound, if it is recent, its own blood and the air has not altered the powder that I will shortly recommend.
And if the air has already altered it, then apply some ointments until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or caused by a cut or similar injury, and its edges are not brought together with sutures, then bring them together with sutures, as I will recommend for their suturing.
However, if the wound has already exposed the bone and tendons, and its only problem is a small detachment, then cut it open and then treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in its place, and instruct the patient to consume foods that are rich in fat: head and feet, and similar things, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone and it does not adhere to the bone, then you cut away all the putrid material and discard it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood may flow, and it has not been severed by medicines, then you investigate the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you cut it with a spatula, or tie it off; and if necessity compels you that what we have said does not work, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is slight; therefore, you can powder them with this powder, for it will consolidate them before the air alters them.
And the way to make the powder is this: take one part olive oil, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts of unquenched lime; grind all of it thoroughly and sieve it, and then fill the wound with it, and bind it tightly until it adheres well and coagulates with the blood.
And then you bind it with bandages and leave it, and do not loosen it until it is no longer inflamed, for the medicine will not be eradicated from it until it is healed.
And sometimes this alone suffices, when you do not have in your presence oil of roses and dragon's blood.
And you do this same procedure on large wounds when it is appropriate to apply it and bind them tightly, and on recent wounds with their own blood, which the air has not yet altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially during summer, then this powder is not appropriate.  Instead, treat them with what we have previously described, or apply digestive ointments, or a poultice of barley flour mixed with water and honey until it hardens; and then treat them with the other methods until they are healed.
But if a small fracture occurs in the bone alongside the wound, then you extract it by manipulation.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of wounds to the neck.
But if a wound occurs on the neck, there is no difference in treatment from a simple wound to the head.
However, if the neck's nerve or artery is cut, then if it's a nerve, it's not an emergency unless the treatment avoids causing excessive astringency, such as using zinc or verdigris (copper sulfate) and similar things, as they damage nerves and cause them to contract. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the limbs.
And if this is treated with gentle medicines, such as washing with fresh water, sometimes infused in oiled or un-oiled materials, and poultices when washed with fresh water, and other softening stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then apply sutures, or close its edges, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or reaches the lower, most vulnerable part of the flesh, then pierce it in the deepest point.
But if an artery is already cut in the wound and blood is flowing, then either tie it off, or cauterize it if necessary.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or the whole neck are severed, and the veins are safeguarded, then you must join the edges of the neck wound with sutures to the neck bone and do not touch it.  First, align it and restore it to its natural shape, then firmly bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days; and then treat it with ointments that have astringent and stimulating properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has already reached the bone, you must treat it, and if there are fragments of bone within, remove all that you can; and what you cannot remove, leave it until the wound begins to suppurate, and the separation and expulsion of the debris is eased.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle powder on it, as instructed. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with what the recollection will provide in its chapter.
If the wound is from a spear or knife, and you observe its depth, then consider further whether the wound is windy (full of air) when the patient breathes; if so, know that the wound is fatal.
And if it is not deep, and the wound is recent with its own blood, then you place on it, at first, a powder, and do not press on it so that the blood is not retained deep inside and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but place there an attractive ointment, and apply it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available to you, then you place in the wound opening old cloth, so that it absorbs the moisture; and make the patient sleep on the wound, so that what is inside the wound will drain out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound was inflicted, and you observe no spasms or tremors in the heart, nor constriction of the breathing, nor other bad conditions, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with poultices and other remedies until it is healed.
But if healing is impossible, and it has been open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore treat it according to its own specific treatment.
And if the wound is from a cut with a knife or sword, and is superficial on the foot or leg, then treat it with stitches, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if the wound has penetrated the bone, and there are already fragments of bone sticking out, then you should clean the wound and try to remove those fragments if they are loose. But if they are not loose, then leave them until the wound can heal, as removing them would be painful.
And for other wounds on other limbs, the treatment is similar to what we have described.
Of wounds of the abdomen.
The ailment that occurs in the abdomen is either severe, mild, or moderate.
A small rupture is difficult to manage in a different way, and the reduction of the parts is more difficult if you don't quickly return the displaced parts to their place, for if it opens and swells, the return becomes difficult.
Therefore, the best type of rupture is a moderate one, because in that case, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, unlike the two types mentioned before.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is done in four ways, but two of these methods are common and applicable to the suturing of other wounds on the body.
Two other specific methods are also applicable to other wounds, yet they are even more specific to suturing the abdomen.
And I will explain each to you with an exposition and a declaration.
Therefore, I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has come out through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is one of two ways: either due to the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when this is the case, you should warm the area by submerging a damp sponge or cloth in lukewarm water alone, or by using water with squinant, cyperus, and spic, and apply that to the intestine until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes, doing this with a styptic is better than using water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And when you see the inflammation resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which the plant althea and mallow have been boiled, for by this the intestine's discomfort is relieved with little effort.
But if the intestine's discomfort is eased by this treatment, then carefully cut the rupture slightly with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is proper and involves no incision, and there is no need for or attempt at cutting when there is necessity and weakness.
Of the instrument, here is its shape:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp, and the tip is slender, and it should not be as slender as a spatula, but rather slightly blunt.
And therefore, when the rupture is enlarged and the intestine is out, then its reduction must be according to its natural form, in its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is wide and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you must have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you raise the head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then constantly pay attention and consider this, so that the part where the rupture is positioned is higher than the other.
And thus you must administer this in large ruptures and in medium-sized ones.
And in small ruptures, place what you have prepared, and then have the assistant hold the rupture entirely with their hand and bring the edges together, and then uncover that area in case there is another cause to the suture.
And this is the common method of suture: one takes the needle, or several needles depending on the size of the rupture; then place the tip of the needle at the edge of the rupture on the ring finger, and hold the needle firmly so you do not pull it on the two ends of the ligament, with the two ends of the stitch under the ligament on the inside, until you have made it penetrate that area; and you have now joined the two ends of the ligament and two ends of the stitch, which is done in four stages.
Then tighten with a double thread around the needle, and sometimes from two sides together, and then bring the two edges and the rupture together in a fitting way; then leave the thickness of the finger and place another needle there, and then tie it with thread, just as you did with the first needle; and do not stop doing this if necessary with needles until you have completed the entire constriction of the rupture.
And the needles should be medium in thickness and fineness, because thin needles easily pierce the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the ligament, and therefore they should be of medium fineness and thickness.
And the needle should not be inserted too close to the two ends of the ligament, so that the flesh is not pierced easily and the wound opens before it heals.
And the sutures should not be too long, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
Then trim the ends of the needles so that they do not disturb the patient's sleep; and place expanding powders on the sutures, covering the ends of the needles, and leave them there until you know the wound is healed.
And this method of stitching with needles is most suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles, or around that number, are enough for the suture.
But the second suture is more common: and it is that you stitch the four ends of the ligament and two ends of the cyst at once, with a needle that is well-wrapped in both thinness and thickness.
And then, when you have pierced these four ends with the needle, return the needle to the same starting point from which you began, so that the thread retracts from the most superior part of the wound, so that the suture is like a fabric stitch with which the fabric is tightened.
And place the width of a little finger between each stitch.
And this suture is known to men.
And with such a suture, I closed the wound which had befallen a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife.  The wound was a tear larger than a palm, and the intestines had protruded about two palms from the middle area of the intestine, and the rupture was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced that protrusion after the intestines had been outside for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated in fifteen days or so, and I cured him and he was healed; and afterwards he lived for many years, and recovered his former condition.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and by miracle he was, for I did not cure him with ointments, for it was in a place where no ointment or medicine was found, but I placed linen cloths over the wound twice a day and diligently washed it with honeyed water until he was healed.
But I will tell you two kinds of sutures, proper according to the narration of the Word.
And it is that you begin with a suture of the cord, and thread the needle from the outside to the inside.
And so, as the needle penetrates the cord and the same wound, according to its length and the entire body, leave the end of the thread where you have threaded the needle; and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside in the other end of the wound.
And when you have made that penetration, then you make that penetrate again in that same end of the wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is in this loop, and make the needle penetrate the other end of the wound from the inside to the outside.
And make penetration with that your penetration with which you make that penetration into the thread at the wound's end, which is on the patient's side, until all of that is penetrated.
And then begin from this same side and stitch that with the thread end on the other side, and pull the needle out of the cord which it penetrated, and then return that into that cord and stitch the thread end that is on the other side with this wound end; and pull that out of the cord which is on his side.
And do that once and again, and do that once again until you sew everything that is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with a skin suture, with which you stitch the skins, in such a way that you stitch the thread one time from the end of the cord, and leave that other time until you have completed it.
However, the second type of proper suture, which is also called Gallic, and this is as he and for him recounted, is that you stitch it in a similar way to how some healers stitch it, in such a way that they add each part to its corresponding part on him, as is appropriate by nature; and they apply the end of one to the end of the wound, and this is done according to what I have recounted to you.
You must place the needle into the wound end close to the external part, and make it penetrate into the internal part of the wound, and leave two ends of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside in two parts of the thread.
And then turn each of those, and make each penetrate from the inside to the outside in two other ends of the wound on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common, simple suture, and is the suture of which we previously spoke.
This is the Gallic method.
And yet some may say, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, which means you place a thread through each, and begin by inserting the needle from your side, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to a suture that joins the layers of skin equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then the suture there is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
But the judgment of the treatment for plague is the same as for other plagues.
Which means that when you catch the plague early, before the air alters it, and you return the bowel and sew it up properly, then place the flesh-restoring powder on it.
And if the air has already altered the plague, then apply some ointments that are readily available to you until they form a hard scab and the pus drains, and are firm and sealed; and then treat it as you would treat other plagues until it is healed.
But if you don't have the medicines available, then apply this immediately, as soon as it begins to pus, old cloth, and change it twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you do not need other medication in many cases when the plagues are simple.
But if you fear that the plague is spreading to the main limbs, then you should soak lion's wool in high-quality olive oil, or scented oil, and place it around the areas between the armpits and below the elbows.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in their bowels, which often happens, then treat it with black astringent wine, and especially if the inflammation has reached the bowel and has made a penetrating exit into its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large bowel is easier to heal than that which is in the small bowels.
And it is difficult to heal, for the bowel called "jejunum" does not receive healing from any plague that affects it completely; and this is due to the large number of veins in it, and because of its large size within those, and due to the subtlety of its structure, and due to its proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if the result of the plague is a membrane, and you find it fresh, return it according to your method of returning the bowels as well.
But if it has gone further and has already turned green or black, then you should squeeze it with a cloth on the area where it is discolored, to cause a flow of blood, for there are veins and arteries in the membrane.
And then cut whatever is attached to that ligament, and hang the two ends of the cloth from below the wound to alleviate the pulling of it away from the wound and the expulsion of the plague's branch (or limb).
A reminder of the plagues when they occur in the bowel.
When a rupture occurs in the bowel, and it is small, it is possible that it can be restored in some people.  For example, I saw a man who had been wounded in his belly with a spear thrust, and the plague was on the right side of his stomach.  The plague was old and had become a fistula, and he expelled gas and wind.
Then I considered his treatment, although it wasn't guaranteed to heal him, but I continued to refine it until he was healed and the area was consolidated.
And I, having seen the area healed, inquired about any further ailments in his stomach.  No further ill effects occurred, and he remained in good condition, eating and drinking, and then he entered a bath and was exercised, as prescribed.
And some experienced practitioners have said that when a wound occurs in the bowel, if it is small, it should be bound in this way: you should take ants with large heads;  then close the two edges of the wound, and place one of those ants with an open mouth over the edges of the wound. When it bites and closes its mouth, cut off its head, as it adheres and does not dissolve.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ants, one after another, according to the size of the entire wound.
And then you compress that and hold it to the wound; and those ant heads remain attached to the bowel until the bowel is healed; and you do no harm to the patient.
And it is also possible to bind the bowel with a fine thread made from the bowel of an animal attached to it, after it is put on a needle;  you take the end of this bowel thread, it should be very thin, then bind the end to the thread, wrapped around it, then insert that thread through needles and, using that needle, compress the bowel and return it to the opening.
And this method of suturing with ants is only a way of trust and hope.
However, if the wound is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the delicate intestines, for then there is only refinement, and not a complete healing of it.
Of the treatment of abscesses and fistulas.
Know that any wound or abscess, when it grows old and becomes an ulcer, and is not healed and continually discharges pus and is not excised, then, in any limb, it is universally called a fistula and we do not call it an abscess in that case.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, fibrous swelling, with no pain and a cavity like the cavity of a bird's quill; and therefore that ulcer is called a *rizatz* (or *rizat*), that is, a quill.
And in some people it is moist, discharging pus; and easily the moisture is excised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and sometimes thin, and sometimes large, and sometimes small.
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of them, and the treatment of them with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary that I make you understand the treatment of a fistula that is created through surgical intervention with the hands.
And understand that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; for among them are fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or the spine, or the intestines, or the bladder, or to one of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the spine, or to one of the joints, which are compound, such as the hand and foot; and of these are those that occur near the main limb and of similar nature.
Therefore, among these fistulas, which are of this type, are among the illnesses with difficult healing, and do not receive a cure, and dealing with them is effort and ignorance.
And if any of these fistulas does not reach the locations I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and want to gain knowledge of it, then take a probe of iron or steel, and if the fistula goes in a straight path, you will find it with it.
But if the fistula is winding, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead, for lead, due to the lightness of its body, is easily bent and guided toward the winding.
And if the fistula has many roughnesses, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe.
Then irrigate the orifices with their orifices, for the moisture through which you irrigate it flows toward the other openings and runs through them.
And then carefully investigate, according to what method is possible for you, to know if there is bone or nerve there, and whether the fistula's cavity is distant or close, or if it is a fistula with many orifices and it is all over that, with the full force of your attention, your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the location of the pain with your hand on the spot, and similar to the meanings and causes that apply to an abscess.
And when you have considered all those points with true judgment, then proceed to treatment according to your knowledge.  Consider whether the fistula is a superficial or near-surface fistula or one in a salty area, distant from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the locations I have mentioned to you.
Then, dry the fistula as previously described, removing the filtering material and corrupted flesh, and whatever has grown from the flesh's opening or from there and similar things, and treat it until healed.
But if the fistula is deep and located, as was mentioned, then it is necessary to cut it, as far as possible for you, and remove all its corrupted flesh.  Then administer some compresses with sharp medicines, and place them inside the fistula's cavity, which you have opened with an iron instrument.
And do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine dissolves everything that remains in the fistula's cavity from the corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have described.
However, if the fistula's cause is bone, and you are sure of this, then you must incise and cauterize it as we have described, unless you believe that any vein, nerve, or major limb is in the way, as we have mentioned.
But if the bone is exposed and there is some corruption or blackness on it, then you scrape away that corruption completely; and then cure it with something that will create flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and continues to fester as before, then know that you have not achieved complete eradication of the corruption; and then you must once more uncover it, thoroughly excavate and cleanse it with your strongest tools, and then restore it.
And if it is healed, well and good; but if not, then know that this corruption lies deep within the body, a condition that cannot be reached, and thus there is no remedy but to leave it be.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or if you can, you should remove it with fine forceps suitable for this purpose.
And if there are many bones, then meticulously remove all of them, and leave nothing behind with your strength.
But if any moisture causes you difficulty, and there is no fear or mistake in their incision, then incise those ligaments or flesh if present, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones immediately, then place something on the wound that can keep the wound closed, and leave it until the area around those bones is free of flesh and ligaments, and keep the wound from healing and make the incision you have made firm during your operation.
However, if you fear it, place cotton soaked in oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any green ointment on it, because when those ligaments soften, and the bones are separated from them, their removal is easier.
But if it is a large bone, like a leg bone or thigh bone, or similar, and only the surface of it is corrupted, then scrape it with a rasp until that blackness and corruption are removed, and then repair the wound.
But if the corrupted portion is large, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to cut the affected area entirely,  incision by incision, until the corruption is reached, and then treat it until it heals.
And I recommend to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use it as an example and help for your operation.
There was a young man, around 30 years of age, who experienced pain in his thigh.  And from the internal parts, there was an accumulation of matter within the body until it reached the thigh.  This was a matter of a large abscess, and it was not caused by an external factor.
And then, because of the doctors' error, the condition was allowed to develop over time until the abscess opened, and a large amount of matter came out.  Its treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulaed, and many openings formed which all discharged pus and bodily humours.
And so, many doctors treated him over two years, and none of them had the expertise in the art, until I was called in.
And I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those openings in great quantity; and already the man's body was all wasted away, and his complexion was yellow.
Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone.
And then I probed all the openings and found them leading to various parts of the leg.
And then I incised one of those openings until I uncovered a portion of the bone, and found it decayed, already turning to earth and blackened; and a portion of the leg was already decaying, having penetrated to the marrow.
And then I closed what I had uncovered of the exposed bone.
And I judged that it was not the bone itself, but that decay which I had cut away and closed, and I had already removed it.
And then I applied restorative medicine to the wound with consolidating remedies for a long time, but it did not heal.
And then I reopened and uncovered the bone a second time, after the first uncovering, and found continuing decay along with the bone.
And I removed what appeared to me as that decay, and then I was forced to perform the healing and restoration of it, but it was not restored.
And then I uncovered it again, and did not cease to cut into the bone little by little, particularly, and forced the restoration of it, but it was not restored until I cut away about a palm's width of it, and extracted the marrow along with it.  Then I restored that area with medicines, and it was slightly consolidated and healed.
And further operations and cutting into it are not necessary, except due to the weakness of the patient, and the small amount of tolerance and fear of death, for in those hours, a harmful fainting spell occurred due to excessive evacuation.
And so, it is healed completely, and nothing is in place of the bone but hard flesh; and its placement within the body is good, and its strength returned; and it has been restored to its normal state, and there is no opposition in its movement or harm in any way.
However, if the bone is prominent in a displaced area of the body, then you should cut it in this way: take a bandage and tie it tightly to the end of that prominent bone, and tell someone to pull it outwards; and place another bandage of thicker wool next to the first bandage; and then bind that over the flesh that is beneath the bone, and extend the ends so as to draw the flesh downwards, and expose the flesh in the area you wish to cut so that the cut doesn't harm the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or a board beneath the bone properly, because when you do that, the cut is not forbidden from not cutting into the corrupted flesh.
And the cutting should be done on the affected area little by little, because if the corruption is within the cavity of the bone and does not appear upon its surface, you may need to cut it again.
And if the bone is corrupted but not protruding, and one part is still joined to the other, with the corruption located in the middle or part of it, then expose all the flesh around it; then place wood underneath, and cut along the first part where the corruption is until the cut reaches the other part.
And the cut should follow the affected area closely, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut through that corrupted joint and cut the bone where it is connected to the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not a reasonable cause, but a trick of nature.
And if the corruption is in the flesh of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, you must investigate the corruption in whatever way it appears to you, and expose it, and cleanse it according to every possibility you have, and by any means possible, provided it does not damage a vein or nerve.
And know that the instruments for cutting and sawing these bones are very specific to the bones' location, preparation, thickness, subtle differences, size (large or small), hardness, and density; therefore, you must prepare appropriate instruments for every type of operation.
And understand that this operation signifies to you the type of instrument you need; when you have great study, long experience, and knowledge of the methods of this art, and experience with illnesses, then you yourself will know what instruments are appropriate for each illness.
And I am now providing you, at the end of this chapter, a list of the instruments you will use, along with instructions on how you will proceed in your treatment, which you will test on other cases. Shape of saw:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of a large saw:
Shape of ray: Let the head of this ray be in the shape of a star-shaped key head, and its points be in the shape of the points of a [possibly "alst/alsterfegi" -- a word unclear from this context].
And it is not suitable unless, with that, the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or the mouth is wide and large.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a broad/flat razor:
The shape of a well-made saw should be an arched curve,  sharpened on its metal edge, and the wooden part of the saw should be a properly crafted pointed blade. Shape of it (or, the shape of the saw/the object).
Shape of a razor with a concave curve/hollowed-out part.
A different, more slender/delicate shape of a razor.
Shape of another razor with a curved end.
Shape of a small razor resembling a tentacle.
Shape of a smaller incision tool/knife.
Shape of another incision tool; this one resembling a ray, and its end is like a saw, and it is used frequently in bone surgery.
Shape of a ray that is suitable for dealing with a bone that is perforated/pierced.
And its tip is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly all the tools we have described—razors, incision tools, and saws—should be made of this.
Of incision tips and the sawing of bones.
The extremities may become diseased either due to internal or external causes, or even if you have treated the corruption with remedies and the treatment is unsuccessful, or if the corruption spreads to a limb not initially affected, then you must make an incision on that limb where the corruption has spread so that the patient escapes death or a greater harm/deficiency in that limb.
And the sign of the afflicted area is that the limb becomes black until it's burned as if by fire, or there might be blackness spreading to the point where it hardens around the limb and spreads to the whole body; and then cut it with an incision there.
And similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of venomous creatures such as a sea scorpion, viper, or similar creatures.
And if the corruption or injury is in the fingertip, then you cut the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.
And similarly, if it affects the hand, then you cut it at the base of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread to the arm's forearm.
And if, instead of that, you find it in the arm, then you cut the arm up to the elbow at the joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond the elbow, then in that case the patient's death is imminent; and applying any other remedy to this is futile.
And similarly, for the foot, if the corruption affects the toe, then you cut it down to one of the joints.
And if it spreads to the sole of the foot, then you cut off the entire foot. But if it rises up to the knee, then you cut the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no cure possible, only resignation, and leaving the patient to their fate.
And the way to cut or sever the limb is that you tighten the ligament in the part just below the place you want to cut, and tighten another ligament above the spot; and the physician stretches a ligament downward, and stretches another ligament upwards; and you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a sharp instrument until all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be cut or severed.
And it is necessary to place linen cloths on all sides so that the area is not touched and that the patient receives a properly formed and pus-filled wound.
But if you encounter blood flow when working, then cauterize the cut area thoroughly, or place some powders that staunch the blood; and then return to your procedure until it is completed.
And then bind the injured limb with suitable bandages, and care for it until it is healed.
And I will now relate to you what happened to a man on his foot, the very same accident which I and you have discussed, where he suffered a dark discoloration on his foot, with a burning that resembled a fire's burning.
And that corruption first appeared on his toe, until it spread to the entire foot.
And then, the man himself, because he saw the cure for the limb with the force of the pain and burning he endured, cut that foot down to the joint, and the wound healed.
For a long time, that same corruption occurred on the finger of his index hand.
And then he came to me, and I was compelled to expel that excess fluid with whatever medicinal remedies I could place on the hand, in an effort to cleanse his body; but the excess wasn't expelled, and it began to spread to the other fingers, until it reached the entire hand.
And he urged me to amputate his hand, but I did not want to do this, hoping for the expulsion of that excess fluid, and fearing the amputation of his hand because of death, for the patient's strength was waning.
And after he left me, he returned to his homeland, and it came to my knowledge that that man had himself cut off his entire hand, and he healed.
And I have related this story only so that it might be helpful in understanding this disease, and that it might serve as a sign, by which it may be recognized and by which it may be treated.
Of the treatment of sinuses and the quality of enemas with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in any fleshy member and the abscess cavity extends until it collects pus, and then it bursts and is perforated, and the pus is discharged, and the area remains empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin covering it is like a thin cloth, and it has not progressed to further corruption, and it does not affect the bone, nerves, or ligaments, it is called a sinus and not a fistula.
However, if the cavity extends until the corruption affects a surrounding part, then it is called a fistula, and not a sinus.
And the treatment for it is to cut away that skin completely as it is turned back, especially when it is thin and formed like cloth, and to make certain that it does not adhere to the affected area because of the corruption.
But if you suspect the skin is adhering and that the corruption hasn't spread further, and there's pus draining from the skin, then treat it with an enema.
And if you consider it a sinus, and if it is large, and the discharge is foul-smelling, then administer an enema with Egyptian medicine, which is made of oil, vinegar, and honey in equal parts, mixed in a vessel and heated over a fire until the mixture becomes golden brown and resembles honey.
Then, take what is necessary from this mixture, dissolve it with water and honey; and administer this mixture as an enema to the sinus, and compress the opening, and leave the medicine there for two hours.
Then, remove that (the medicine) with care; and do this for as many days as necessary until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor has disappeared.
And sometimes, if this medicine is not available, it is treated with water mixed with ashes; and for this, you should take the ashes of a plant, mix water with it, then filter the liquid, and administer it as an enema until you are confident the sinus is relieved.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then administer an enema of water mixed with honey and finely ground cumin, or administer an enema of wine and honey mixed, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing, while wine helps to adhere to the sinus, especially when the wine contains an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are sure the sinus is healed, then administer an enema that promotes the growth of flesh in that area.
And you should take diaphenolic unguents and dissolve them in rosemary oil and astringent wine; or you could administer enemas with other medications and ointments that have properties I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow and the enema tube cannot be inserted, then widen it gradually with a small iron implement, and apply a poultice wrapped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should draw together the edges of the opening with sutures, leaving enough space for the enema tube to pass without difficulty.
And if the opening through which the fistula drains is elevated in the upper part, then dry that area at the lowest point to make the fistula drain downwards, because when the fistula is contained within the depth of the sinus, the flesh will grow there.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus to the lowest bone as desired, then you must prepare the limb with a preparation so that the fistula drains easily as is appropriate, and so that no cause of blockage of the fistula remains.
But that which is over the sinus opening, should remain at all times, so that what is secreted from the fistula is discharged. And so that you may know if what flows from the fistula is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.
And by this, consider the location of the sinus, if the patient feels pain there, and if there is an abscess there.
And when your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter discharged onto the sinus opening has already adhered, or shows signs of adherence, then on the third day, you detach it, and when you detach the scab, change the cloth to another one and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus there is a thin, subtle discharge, then do not despair of the adherence of it, for the healing process is appropriate; for some people take a long time for flesh to grow over their wounds, and in others, the opposite occurs.
And if from the sinus a significant amount of undigested discharge has come out for many days, then know that the sinus has not adhered; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should adjust the drying effect of the medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, make them dry like a diafinicon ointment, by adding a dry substance such as zegi.
The final treatment, with which it is cured, is to take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it in rosined oil, and then add old, strong wine to it, and mix it thoroughly, and use that.
And similarly in that procedure, when there is no discharge, use diafinicon ointment, honey when it is cooked until it is thickened, and use it; or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, grind and powder them, and mix them with honey heated on the fire until thickened, and apply this mixture to a cloth and apply that to the sinus; or apply the thickened honey to a cloth, and apply that to the sinus.
Sometimes it is administered with long, slender roots of a celestial lily (and it is a celestial lily), and the flour of eris and centaury.  Use these simple ingredients, separately or combined, grind them, sift them, and powder them and mix them with the honey previously described; and use it.
And if the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the bone, or other hard members or ligaments; then you treat it with fistular treatment, as mentioned above.
Of the treatment of whitlow, and of the bruised nail and the incision of the affected finger, and its sectioning.
Whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the finger of the hand or foot, and commonly arises on other fingers.  When it is prolonged and its treatment is less favorable, or if it is an abscess from a deep-seated abscess or is corrupted, it emits pus until it corrodes the base of the nail, and frequently corrupts the entire nail.  Often, the corruption spreads to the bone until it has a foul odor, the end of the finger is blackened, and the color is dark.
Therefore, when you have done what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not work, then you should cut away all the excess of the nail with iron, and then cauterize the wound with that, for cautery is very helpful in this.
However, if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the nail's additions have already pushed the flesh inward, and they begin to pierce and ulcerate it, then you should place a thin blade under the angle of the nail that is piercing the flesh, and lift it up and cut the flesh easily, and place on what remains of the flesh the burning and corrosive remedies until it is completely removed; and then treat that with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then you must cut into the bone and remove it, for a corrupted bone will never heal.
And if the corrosion and corruption extend to the finger, then you cut it at one of the joints, according to the prognosis of its recovery, and then treat it until it is healed.
However, if the nail has suffered a blow or friction, and there is intense pain, then you should first bleed the patient, and then dry the nail with a sharp scalpel by making a transverse cut from top to bottom, and be careful not to reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause the patient intense pain and might cause the birth of excess adhering flesh in the area. Then treat that area with whatever alleviates the pain.
But a swollen finger, which is often born in the hands of some people, is quite fleshy, and it is often on the bones, or often on the nails.
And some of them are born at the base of the joint, or their origin is in some of the finger joints. However, the one that is born in some joints of the finger is not harmful, and the one that is born in the joints is quite painful.
And for those that are fleshy growths, the incision should be gentle, and you should cut it along its base with a broad scalpel.
But for the one that is born at the base of the joint, the treatment is difficult; therefore, be careful with its removal.
However, for the one that is born on a finger near the joint, you should first cut through the flesh around it with a circular incision, right down to the bone, then use a suitable saw to cut through the bone, and then treat it until it is healed.
However, when the fingers stick together, either by birth, or due to a wound or burn or similar injuries, you must separate the solidified parts until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then, place cloths soaked in warmed oil between them to prevent them from sticking together easily, and separate them, or insert a thin sheet of lead between them until they have healed properly.
And similarly, if fingers stick together to the palm, then you must separate the adhesion according to what is appropriate and restores the correct shape of the limb.
Of incisions of veins, these are varicose veins.
Varicose veins are swollen, thick veins full of melancholic excess fluids that appear in various parts of the body, most commonly in the legs, and especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Therefore, you should administer purging of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
However, the treatment of them with iron is in two ways: one is that they be incised and that the black blood be drawn out, and the other way is that the vein be elevated and all of it be extracted.
The sectioning of it is done in this way: first, soak the leg in very hot water until the thick, phlegmatic blood in the leg is resolved. Then, tightly bind the patient's leg from the upper thigh area down to below the knee with a bandage.  Next, cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.  Then, elevate the black blood with your hand from the bottom of the leg up and down, until the desired amount of blood has been removed, and this will alleviate the patient's ailment.
And then bandage it, and order the patient to abstain from foods that engender black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are full and this is noticed by the patient.
But the elevation of them is done in this way: you raise the patient's leg, if it is very swollen, and then put it in a bath and soak the leg with hot water until it turns red and the veins are prominent; or if a bath is not available, it is exercised by vigorous activity until the limb is warmed.
Then cut the cord (likely a vein) directly above the vein by incision along the length, or behind it, below the knee, or further down near the heel.
Then open the cord with forceps and scrape the vein on all sides until it appears sensitive, and it is near the appearance of it becoming discolored, turning towards blackness.
And then, when you drain and from the cord, you see that white, which is the cord.
And then you place a reed underneath it so that it is elevated and pulled away from the cord, and suspend it with a curved forceps.
And then make another incision near that incision after three days, and then scrape the cord on the side above the vein until it appears.
And then lift that and cut it in a back incision near the ankle, and then extract that and lift it until it comes out through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision above it.
And do this until you extract that from the incision that is highest or most elevated of all the incisions, until everything is out; and then cut that.
And if you are unable to extract and elevate it, then insert a needle with a strong double hook and tie it and extract it, or insert a reed under it and turn your hand around until it is thrown out. And be careful not to cut it; for if it is broken, it is difficult for you to raise it much, and it has come upon the patient by that injury.
And when you have completely expelled it, then place on the wound area wool soaked in wine and rubbed oil and unrubbed oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having a tortuousness to which it is wrapped in parts, and is not straight as we have said, then it is necessary that you cut along that in every part of its tortuosity and in the places where it is wrapped, and then suspend it with hooks until you raise the entire thing.
And be careful in your incision not to cut the vein and not to injure it, for it will be difficult for you to raise it; and use your prudence in this.
Form of the incision with which a vein is cut:
It is not so sharp as the hooks, nor does it have a sharp tip, so as not to injure the vein; and it is of considerable flexibility, like a lion's, for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein by its subtlety; however, it has an appropriate thickness, as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in warm lands, like in the land of the Arabs and in the hot, arid lands of India, where little vegetation grows.
And it is easily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from under the skin, like serpents, worms, and grubs that breed between the skin and the flesh.
A sign of the onset of this condition is that a vehement inflammation occurs in the leg's vein; and soon the area becomes blistered; and soon the vein begins to emerge from that blister, like the root of a plant.
And when the extremity of it appears, then you should wrap a lead weight, which is the weight of a drachma, or two drachmas, around that.  Bind that and let the lead remain hanging from the leg.
And as many times as any cause of this is found on the external parts, wrap that in lead and bind it. And if the condition is prolonged, then you should incise a part of it and bandage the remainder; and do not incise it at the root until it has come out, for if you incise it at the root, it contracts and enters the flesh, causing an abscess and suppuration at the site, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is expelled from behind it and no part of it remains in the body.
And from this vein have come out in some men to a length of five palms and ten fingers, and it has already come to my attention that one of twenty palms has emerged.
And if it is incised at the time of its treatment, then insert the reed into its opening and pierce it through with a long tube attached to the body, until all that is in the material is evacuated, and administer poultices to the site for a few days with medicines; and then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot, and it has many openings, and a branch emerges from each opening.
And therefore treat it in the same way as we have stated in the division and with what has been previously stated.
Of the incision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
This illness is called bovine illness in some lands near us, because it often affects livestock, and is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh, and moves throughout the body, up and down, and is felt in its movement from limb to limb until it bursts the skin and comes out.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humours, just as worms, serpents, and lombrics and ascarids generate in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it moves through the body and ascends to the head, and reaches the eye, it often causes intense inflammation there, entering and destroying the eye.
And therefore, when you want to cure it and extract it, it can only be done by following its movement and appearance as felt, and then you must compress what is above it and what is below it with strong binding and constriction, and then cut over it and extract it.
And if it is hidden within the flesh and you cannot find it, then you apply a cautery with fire to the area until it dies, and the main cause feared is its corruption, which corrupts the area as we have said.
And if you see that being near the eye, then compress the eyebrow with strong pressure, and then cut above it and extract it; and the patient must use means to cleanse the body of bad putrid humours, and guard against foods that cause putrefaction.
Of a section concerning illness of the nose.
This illness is called "nafir" in our land, and it is a pain that comes to certain parts of the body, and then it moves from one part to another.
And I have already seen that, as I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I examined her arm and saw a small inflammation in the vein of the arm, and after staying there for an hour, I saw that inflammation move like a worm climbing, but more quickly than expected, as if it were living silver moving from place to place.
And then the pain moved from that location and settled in the muscle, and there it remained for an hour.
And then it moved to the other side of the body until it reached the other arm.
And then I noticed it moving throughout her entire body as I watched; and I was very amazed by its movement from one limb to another. And I had previously seen things like that with my own eyes, however, I have seen many cases where pain moves from one limb to another. But I did not see it with my eyes in such a way as in the woman.
And I did not consider it to be anything else than that because the woman was old, with dry flesh and exposed veins, and in this appearance the moving air was felt.
And it is necessary that it not appear in this way in those who are delicate, with moist flesh and hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then it does not appear to you visually in the way we have said, then you gently and slightly press over it until that compressed wind is released, and cauterize the area.
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you treat it with expectorants and with what expels wind, and treat it with stinky pills and pills of Serapion and the like.
Of the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their types and the body parts they are lodged in, because their diversity is that some have large points, and small ones, and concave and blunt ones, which are solid; and others have three angles, and those with tongues; and those with feathers.
And the signs of the brain when an arrow lodges in it, and pierces the bone, and is exited from the skull which is over the brain, are sudden violent pain, blindness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, inflammation and redness of the tongue, spasms and confusion of thought and vomiting of bile, and the speech is badly affected and the voice is destroyed, and white humidity resembling dust emerges from the wound site, and the area around it resembles the watery state of the flesh.
And therefore, if these signs appear to you, then you abstain from treatment and from extracting the arrow, unless it is on the surface.
But the signs of the arrow when it lodges in the heart, is that it is near the left nipple, and feels as if it were stuck in a hard thing, and not a hollow thing; and the movement of the arrow is very much like the pulse's movement, and black blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness in the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting; and therefore know that death descends without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are the expulsion of foamy blood from the wound, and the vessels close to the neck are inflamed, and the patient's color has changed, and they exhale large amounts of air, and crave drawing in cool air.
And if the arrow strikes the membrane which is in the foot, the pain is then near the small ribs, and great distress is caused with violent pain and sighing, and all the muscles in the limbs are affected.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then soon undigested food will come from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly and lodges there, a rupture of the wound, or of the tissue, or intestine, will appear.  There is no hope for its cure, even with the removal of the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine leaks from the wound, and some cause of this emission spreads to external parts, and severe pain quickly afflicts the patient, then know that it is fatal.
However, the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders, the supporting structures, the vertebrae of the back, the collarbone, the thigh, the leg and their counterparts among the limbs, are saved according to the greatest possible dispositions when the arrow does not hit a vein or artery, and if it is not a poisoned arrow.
And I tell you this, what I have seen concerning these arrows, so that you might understand it for your own treatment.
Which is why, when an arrow strikes a person in the tear duct of their eye, near the base of the nose, and I removed it from the other side, below the ear, he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the area of his eye, below the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already embedded; only a small tip, which adhered to its shaft, was retrieved. It was a large, sharp arrow, typical of the Turkish ones, with a lion's head design on the shaft, and no barb.
And the Jew was healed, and no ill effects occurred in his eye.
And I removed another arrow from a Christian man, which had lodged in his throat.  It was an Arabic arrow, with barbs; I then cut around it between two guides, as it was already embedded in his throat.  I carefully extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I removed another arrow from a man, which had lodged in his stomach, and I thought he would die from it.  However, after thirty days had passed, and no change in his condition had occurred, I cut around the arrow and carefully extracted it. He was healed, and no ill effects resulted.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his back, and the wound healed.  But after nearly seven years, the arrow emerged from the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow lodged in her stomach, and the wound healed within her.  There was no change in her condition, and the woman suffered no harm in any of her natural bodily functions.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow lodged in his face, and the wound healed and the arrow remained.  Finding little pain, he resembled the others.
And I extracted the arrow from the King's prince, which had lodged in the middle of his nose, and had already slightly deviated to the right side, with the entire arrow hidden.
And I was called to treat him shortly after the arrow's lodging, within three days.
And then I found the arrow wound very tight; and then I probed it with a fine probe, and felt nothing; but he felt a prick beneath his right ear, and then I suspected that this prick was caused by the arrow's tip.
And I applied a plaster to the area, one with attractive and digestive properties, confident that the area would become suppurated so that the arrow's position would become apparent, and that the wound would dry over it.
And there was no significant subsequent wound reaction that the arrow had reached that spot; and I continued with the plaster on it for many days and there was no further incident; and meanwhile the wound healed, and the patient remained free of pain from the extraction for many days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened, and with the probe I examined it, and found the fine arrowhead, which adhered to the shaft.
And then I continued treating the wound with that sharp medicine until the arrowhead became visibly apparent to me, and I spent time with this for a period of approximately four months.
And then, because the wound had become inflamed, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it, and it remained, and did not yield, then I continued to devise and experiment with various techniques, until one day I managed to use skillfully crafted forceps, as described in the latter part of this chapter, to extract it; and then I healed that wound.
Some physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored, but I restored it, and the wound healed completely, and the patient was completely healthy and suffered no ill effects from it.
And I recount to you the method of extracting some arrows, so that you may regard this as a rule and significance of what I have said, because the parts of this art and the definitions of it are not contained within this narration and are not encompassed by the book.
And the skilled craftsman compares the little with the much; and with what is present with what is absent; and finds a new operation and a new instrument for removing foreign objects from the art when it happens.
Therefore, I say that arrows are not pulled from the limbs into which they are shot except in two ways: either by pulling from the location where they enter; or by pushing from the other side.
And that which is driven out from the place where it entered, or is an arrow lodged in a fleshy area, is pulled out and driven out.
And if you do not follow this procedure at the time of extraction, then you must leave it for several days until the surrounding flesh can heal, and the pulling of it and its removal is relieved.
And similarly, if it is lodged in bone and you do not follow the procedure, then leave it for several days and repeat the pulling and movement each day, and it will be driven out.
And if you do not follow the procedure for a few days, then you must pierce the area surrounding the arrow in that bone from all sides with a fine drill until the space around the arrow is enlarged, and then remove it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body, and cannot be felt, then you must search for it with probes, and if you feel it, then pull it out using appropriate tools for extraction.
And if you cannot reach it due to the tightness of the wound and the length of the shaft, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, then you must enlarge the wound until it is sufficiently widened and the arrow can be extracted.
And if it is held by its ear-like parts, then you must carefully detach the flesh it is lodged in, using every skill possible.  If you cannot release the flesh from the fracture or twisting of the ear-like parts, then manipulate them until they yield.
When you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is lodged, then use twisting motions of your hand with forceps on all sides until you make it yield.  Be very careful so that the arrow does not break, and make the extraction of it as easy as possible.
And if you cannot remove it immediately, then leave it for several days until the surrounding tissues can heal, and then try again once it has softened. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then apply the treatments described in the relevant chapter on healing.
And carefully consider cutting a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use every possible method to remove the arrow.  Do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I and you have discussed.
And therefore, pull the arrow in the opposite direction to the way the arrowhead was lodged in him, because that is more helpful. But if that is not possible, then apply whatever methods are possible using the described positions.
But if the arrowheads are protruding from the opposite side, or you have already extracted a portion of the arrow from the exterior, or if the arrowhead is causing a bulge from the side closest to the bone and just above that bulge; then you must cut there.  Let the incision be according to the size of the forceps, and then pull it out, for it will be easy to remove thus.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you should twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrowhead grips the bone, and expands itself, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is inside, then you push it out with it.
But if the shaft is lodged and you want to administer an impulse, then you insert it, if it is blunt, with a concave instrument so that the concavity of it enters the arrow's tail and then push it out with it.
But if the arrow is concave, then you push it out with a strong instrument that enters it, for the arrow is loosened by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you cauterize all the flesh in which the barb is, if it is possible for you, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow lodges in the foot, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut around it, then cut around it and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and pull it out, and then cauterize the wound if needed, and treat it until it is healed.
Shape of forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
Let their ends be like the beak of a bird, which are made like a saw when they grasp the arrow so that they do not let go of it.
And of these, many varieties are made, large, small and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and the patient's constriction (or, potentially, strength).
like a ray, so that the insertion of it into the concave arrow is made easy and it is pushed with that.
Of bloodletting from the veins.
The veins for bloodletting, of which there is a custom of bloodletting, are as follows:  from chapter XVI, there are two pulsating veins near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins in the two apparent temples; two veins in the two tear ducts, called *aspicientz*; the vein in the middle of the forehead; the vein at the end of the nose; two veins at the neck; two veins on the upper lip; two veins on the lower lip; these are called *algelic*; and two veins below the tongue. But the veins that are bled in the arms are five: one is the cephalic, situated towards the wild side; the people call it "the vein of the head"; it is a superficial vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilica and another branch of the cephalic; the people call that one "vein of the whole body."  The basilica is the vein located on the domestic side, called "citillar," and the common people call it "the vein of the belly."  The vein of the arm, located on the forearm, is the one from which blood is drawn, and is the one that appears on the elbow by manifest appearance.  There is also the *salvatella*, the vein located between the aforementioned radial vein and the little finger, in the two hollows.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins: one is located below the bend of the knee on the wild side; the second is *sophena*, and its location is below the leg on the domestic side; the third is the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg on the wild side; and there are other similar veins in the leg.
The treatment of veins near the ears is for headaches, migraines, inflammation, and other bad chronic head ulcers.
And the method of drawing blood from those veins, as I recommend to you, is to shave the patient's head, and to rub the back of the patient's head, at the location of both veins, with a wide cloth using good friction; then, have the patient compress their neck with a bandage until the two points of the veins near the ears appear in two indented places on the head; then, you should find them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those veins with your finger, then you should bleed them with a lancet.
Then take the lancet knife, which is sharp, and carefully insert it under the vein into the groove until the bleeding reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the vein and groove to the upper part and make a sharp incision into the vein. And make the incision about the length of two fingers joined together, or thereabouts; and let the blood flow out as much as you desire.
And then press with cloths and leave it until it is healed.
And already in the beginning of the book, the incision of these things and their cauterization has been described.
However, in the case of the two arterial veins, which are in the temples, bloodletting is beneficial for chronic migraines, persistent eye inflammation, and the expulsion of acute excesses that have accumulated in the head.
And the technique for bloodletting those veins, as I recommend to you, is to press the patient's head with your hand until the two veins become clearly visible, and the pulse of them is felt under your finger; then you should apply a tourniquet.
And then you raise the skin over the vein, along the upper parts, with your index finger, and insert the lancet under it, raising the vein up; and cut it, just as you did with the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to the amount you need.
And then loosen the patient's collar, place your finger on the vein for an hour, then apply a poultice and powders and tightly compress that area, and leave it until it is healed.
And the recollection of them, and their incision, and their extraction, has already been described at the beginning of the book.
Therefore, bloodletting from the vein of the forehead is suitable for bloodletting from the cephalic vein for old diseases of the face, migraines, stiffness, and foul ulcers.
And the procedure for bloodletting from the vein is as I recommend to you; that is, the patient tightens their collar with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument, which is called a lancet (fossori), of which this is the shape:
Place the sharp point of the lancet, which is at the tip of the lancet, on the vein and strike it with a hammer or another suitable tool in the proper manner, and allow the blood to flow according to the desired quantity.  Then, loosen the patient's collar and compress the area until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however, the phlebotomy should not be of acute extremity as with other phlebotomies, but rather of a blunt extremity, and phlebotomize it across, for the bone is close and strong; otherwise, the phlebotomy, when it is delicate, would break.
However, bloodletting from the two veins that are near the tear ducts is beneficial for scabies of the eyes, for inflammation and swelling in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the procedure for bloodletting is that the patient should tighten their own collar with a bandage, and then bloodletting is performed, and you should be standing over their head.
And the bloodletting should be done transversely, along the length a little, with a slightly blunt lancet, for in that location there is little flesh; and if the lancet is too sharp, easily its tip will be broken.
And then allow the blood to flow as much as is necessary for you, and place a compress on them, and hold them firm for a night, and then remove them.
However, bloodletting from the vein in the nose is beneficial for acute fevers and severe headaches, and for diseases of the face, and migraines and inflammation that occur on the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the procedure for bloodletting from there is that the patient should tighten their collar, and then you should hold their nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long lancet and insert it into the middle of the bridge of the nose in a straight line, because the vein is not immediately apparent here, and the blood will start to flow immediately.
You should slowly move your hand with the lancet and let the blood run according to your needs; and then apply a bandage for a night, as it will heal quickly.
However, bloodletting from the two veins is helpful for constriction of the chest, the beginning stages of leprosy, and many other diseases, including impetigo and painful, corrosive ulcers as well as herpes.
And the procedure for bloodletting from those veins is that the patient should tighten the area beneath each vein with a bandage; and the practitioner should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be seated on a stool.
Then, carefully bloodlet the vein along with a wide lancet, slowly; and then draw out blood in a moderate amount, or according to the needs of the situation; and then do the same with the other vein.
Then remove the bandage and gently compress the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not harmed, and leave it until morning, as the wound will heal.
And bloodletting from the superficial veins is helpful for small abscesses and pustules of the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and painful ulcers and fissures, and painful ulcers that are on the nose and around it.
And the procedure for bloodletting from those veins is that you should make the patient sit before you, and bind their neck with a bandage, and then pull back their lips and locate two veins, one on the right of the lip and the second on the left; and the identification of each is by the darkness of each of them, and this is because there are smaller black veins in the surrounding area; and then cut each with a sharp incision.
But if there is doubt, and you do not know which one is which, then you should make the incision on the largest and most obvious of those veins.
And do the same for the two veins that are on the upper lips.
But bloodletting of the cephalic veins below the tongue is helpful for ailments like inflammation of the throat, problems with the uvula, and mouth ailments.
And the method of bloodletting those veins is to have the patient lie between your hands, facing the sun, and lift their tongue, and look under the tongue, for the vein on one side and the vein on the other side, and the colour of each is leaning towards blackness.
And then bleed each; and be careful not to overdo it with the bloodletting, for below those are arteries.
And the veins that are bled in the elbow are the ones that are customarily bled in all men, and their bloodletting is done in two ways: either with a leech, or a lancet with a small, tapering blade; or, a cut with a knife, and it is called a "section," and this is its method:
Place the leeches so as to open the concave, full veins that appear thick, and those that contain thick, disturbed blood.
And this lancing is of smaller width and more delicate tip, and is appropriate for lancing thin veins that contain thin, citrus-like blood.
But the benefit of lancing the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is to draw blood from illnesses located below the collarbone and neck, and from those affecting the feet and abdomen.
And it is necessary for the blood-letter, when lancing this vein, to be very careful and cautious, because underneath it lies an artery; and if he errs and miscalculates the lancing point, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood.  Therefore, this vein should not be lanced with a sharp lancet, but rather with a cutting instrument like a scalpel.
And if the basilic vein is not readily visible, then you should leave it and move to another vein, or look for one of its branches; or you should lance a vein in the end part of the arm, as that is visible; and cut that vein with a scalpel-like lancet, as we have said.
But if you want to lance that same vein, then before tightening the arm you must probe the area until you find the pulse point, and then place a bandage over it; and then tie the arm and cut the vein with a concave cut using a scalpel-like lancet, as we have said; and be careful that the cut is at a safe distance from the artery.
And when you, by tightening the ligature, see swelling in the area you marked with a bandage, then that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid that spot.
And if you see the blood flowing from the lancing like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery; and then you should quickly place your finger over it for a long space; and then remove your finger, and if the blood has stopped, as often happens, then you should tighten the arm and leave that spot.
And watch the patient closely, and be wary of him and do not neglect him for several days until he is healed.
But if the blood does not stop, and you perceive that you have no suitable medicine for this, then you should cut the artery, if it seems to you to be necessary; because the extremity is constricted, and the blood is stopped; or that you take the bark of the fig tree, and crush it, and take one half and tighten it over the vein with a tight bandage and powders until the next day.
And then if the blood has stopped, it is good; and if not, then treat it with what precedes, for the recollection of the powder spot, to stop the flow of blood.
And the stopping of the blood from it is difficult in many positions because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.
But from the vein, flebotomy is a help, removing blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches of the basilica and branches of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be cautious in performing the phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve; and if, in making the puncture, the phlebotomist hits the nerve, stupor will result, and healing will be difficult, and often the limb will not be fully healed.  This nerve is frequently apparent to the senses; and if it is hidden from some, and is subtle and not obvious, then you must position the phlebotomy instrument, which you use for the incision, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should incise the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and is beneficial for illnesses of the eyes.
And in this case, if you wish to perform phlebotomy, use an olive or myrtle phlebotomy instrument; for it is the safest of all veins, as it is neither under it an artery nor a nerve.
However, a boil is often present in some men, if not found on the first percussion, but do not press on it.
The first thing to know is that phlebotomy is administered only to maintain health and to anticipate and prevent illness.  It should be performed on one of the veins in the elbow—that is, the cephalic, basilic, or median cubital—and at the start of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter shortly after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed either on the third day, or on the first day after three hours have passed.
However, phlebotomy should be performed when necessity and suitability dictate, whether by night or by day, at any hour and in any circumstance.
And children should not be bled until they are fourteen years old, and pregnant women should not be bled until the fourth month and up to the seventh, and the elderly who have already passed sixty years should not be bled.
And if someone wishes to be bled in any way, it is necessary to cleanse their bowels beforehand with a clyster of Leon, if they have much retained fecal matter, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities from the bowels, which are impure, and harm the main members [of the body].
And patients suffering from nausea, vomiting, and cramping, or from illness or drunkenness, should not be bled until this is removed from them; nor those suffering from dropsy.  Moreover, phlebotomy should be avoided in the presence of colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, heavy labor, exertion, fasting, or vigils, and any other activity that dissolves the body's or the soul's vitality.
And beforehand, consider the subtlety of the humors, if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines, if it is possible.
And, if no reason prevents it, enter a bath, or be exercised so that the blood becomes more subtle.
And perform the phlebotomy on them in the afternoon, around the hour of the third hour of the day, as we have said.
And be sure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all harmful influences, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily stresses, such as excessive work, pain, sexual activity, and things like them.
And at their bedside, have present those things in whose use there is a custom among men, with aromatics and scents and balsams and similar things, according to the amount possible.
And have the phlebotomist sit on a cushion higher than the cushion of the person who is to be bled.
And then he should raise his arm, and the phlebotomist should rub it with their hand two or three times; and then tie the ligament with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is not tight, or if it is accompanied by excess, then you should prohibit the flow of blood; or if it is with a softening, then you should likewise prohibit the flow of blood.
And then, concerning the constriction, it is fitting that the person to be bled rub their hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly felt.
And then the phlebotomist should anoint their lancet with a bit of old, proper oil; and then place their left index finger on that vein, below the place where the phlebotomy is desired, so that the vein retracts slightly, and the throbbing stops, for it is of the veins that one finds thus, like a cord fleeing from the phlebotomy.  And of those that are full of windiness, and when you place the lancet upon them, are constricted towards the phlebotomy. Then the phlebotomist can see; and if the lancet does not open the vein, and if it does open it, that vein is tight.
Therefore, for this reason, the phlebotomist must be careful and diligent in all these matters.
And then, after placing the lancet, if the vein is opened in one go, that's good; and if not, repeat this another time below that spot a little, or above it with haste, if the place is not inflamed.
And if the place is inflamed, or the patient feels fear, then leave it for a day or two, and do not bind tightly, for a strong pressure will draw out the inflammation, nor allow them to bathe.
And then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough blood will flow out as desired, then repeat the phlebotomy in the same spot, adjusting the opening a little, and do this quickly before the area becomes inflamed, for the area often becomes inflamed in many people with only a small incision.
But if the area is already inflamed, then do not repeat the procedure, for it is not useful for any reason; and place on it a small piece of linen soaked in oil, for it eases the flow of blood. And it is better in this situation to use oil than other oils.
Similarly, apply a linen soaked in oil in every phlebotomy, with which you open veins to avoid blood congestion.  This is done with theriac, aloe, and saffron when one of those is applied to the area, because the blood is refined and made less thick when it is diluted.
And if a large abscess forms at the site of the phlebotomy, as often happens, especially in those who have not been bled before or the incision on the vein is small, then you should cauterize, and place a sponge soaked in warm salt water on the area and hold it there for an hour, as it will dissolve [the swelling].
And it is necessary to do this close to the point where the blood flows from that vein, with the assistance of the patient or another person.
And if some blackness or greenish discoloration remains in the area for a few days, do not be concerned; if you wish, apply a mixture of aloe and myrrh, or some juice of mint or balm or similar substances.
And many times abscesses and swellings occur after phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
Therefore, place your hand on it, and if you find softness under your pressure, then that swelling is harmful and bad; and then be careful not to apply anything of what we have said, because blood will easily flow from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that is astringent, so that the area hardens, and then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And it is necessary to draw blood from each person according to their constitution and according to the colour and appearance of the blood.
For if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it becomes red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it becomes thinner; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is lessened.
And it is necessary for someone who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting in one session, that the vein be opened widely and the bloodletting be extensive.
And in someone who is frail, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary to draw blood from them in smaller amounts, and that the opening be narrow.
And the best approach in bloodletting from a vein is a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safer from blood flow and nerve damage, and is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting along the length and breadth of the vein.
And in those who are prone to fainting during bloodletting, you should treat them beforehand with a small piece of bread soaked in wine or simple warm vinegar; and draw only a small amount of blood in three or four sessions.
And if the person has a cold constitution, then give them bread soaked in myrrh syrup, or honey syrup aromatized with spices like pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar, or an aromatic and strongly scented syrup, before the bloodletting.
And if fainting occurs during bloodletting, and it is caused by the outflow of too much blood, then it is necessary that they drink broth and a very fragrant, subtle syrup; and use aromatic herbs, and have their feet warmed with them.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the section on fainting due to evacuation.
And whoever wants to draw their arm and thin their blood a second time, it is necessary for the bloodletting to be a gradual evacuation, and its effect is slow, evacuating the blood little by little, according to the amount of the effect over the following days.
But if someone wants to draw their arm and bleed again, and their body is strong, then do this approximately seven or nine hours after the first bloodletting.
But if one wants to draw blood from the body to the opposite part of the body where it is concentrated, it is necessary that it be drawn on the second or third day.
However, in a body where the blood is already heated and is inflamed and causing a fever, it is necessary to draw a large amount of blood at once, and to increase the procedure until fainting occurs, provided that you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and that you place your hand on the patient's pulse, close to the blood vessel, so that death ensues instead of fainting, for this often happens when the blood-letter is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not appropriate, when you want to draw the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed and the blood flow is difficult, to press forcefully and have the arm stretched slightly; for this is very harmful.
Leave it until it is bled a second time; or remove the clotted blood from the opening of the vein; or place theriac, or sagzenea, on it, and compress gently until the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you draw blood from that location or from another vein in the other arm.
And the vein called the "cord of the arm" is bled instead of the cephalic or basilic vein, when these are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of those [veins].
The method of bleeding them is that the patient should immerse their hand in warm water until the arm (or vein) reddens and the vein appears clearly.
And then, a moderately tight bandage should be applied; then, bleed along the small transverse line, not longitudinally or laterally.
And if the opening is wide, make your incision just a little above the joint of the hand.
And if the flow of blood is prohibited, then you should re-immerse the hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your goal.
However, if you are in the summer days, you are excused from re-immersion of the hand in warm water, and in winter, the patient's body should be placed in warm water.
And bleeding from this vein is safer than from any other vein, for there are no pulsating veins or nerves below it.
And bleeding from the vein of the right wrist is appropriate for liver ailments.
And the method of bleeding from it is that you should hold the hand with a bandage or with your hand, after placing it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then make an incision across it; and if you cut it cleanly, it will not harm the patient in any way.
And be careful not to cut too deeply with your lancet, for beneath it are the nerves of the exposed fingers.
And then return the hand to the warm water and let the blood flow from it, for if you don't return it to the warm water, the blood will clot at the opening of the vein, and the flow will be obstructed.
And when the blood has been drawn according to the necessary amount, then you apply oil and salt to the vein, so it does not close up quickly; and similarly, you should do this to all the veins cut.
But the benefit of bleeding from the left hand is that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen.
And do likewise in bleeding him as you did in the other.
And the benefit of bleeding from the saphenous vein is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine problems, and retention of menses, and kidney ailments, and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar ailments.
And the procedure for bleeding him is that the patient should immerse their foot in warm water and rub it until the veins appear; and bandage the joint of the foot with a strap; and the location of the vein, clearly visible near the toe, and from there it branches out into many small veins on the surface of the foot.
And therefore, bleed the most prominent vein, either below the leg towards the toe, or towards the ankle, for this is better and more beneficial.
And if you bleed that vein on the surface of the foot, then be careful of the nerves underneath that on the surface of the foot, and perform your phlebotomy across it, as if you were intending to cut it.
And let the phlebotomy be well-done.
But if bleeding is prohibited; then you should immerse the patient's foot in warm water and let the blood flow out from there until it is evacuated.
And if the blood-letter errs in the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy slightly higher, for the location is beneficial; and do not fear harming the patient, but rather be careful of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly, do the same to the vein on the other foot also.
And for the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, beneath the bone of the outer side.
And the benefit of the phlebotomy for him is for hip pain when it is caused by hot blood.
And the procedure for the phlebotomy is that the patient enters a bath, and tightly wraps the thigh from the wide area above the heel, for four days, with a long, thin bandage, for it only appears then.
And therefore, when it appears, then you perform phlebotomy on that vein according to the best method available to you, and in a transverse direction;  either cut it by incision, or sever it by section, since the area is inflamed.
And it is quite hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it doesn't appear on the surface, then you should phlebotomize a branch of it, which is the one that appears on the back of the foot, near the aforementioned auricular and annular veins.
And be careful of the nerves, and draw out as much blood as you desire.
And then release the constriction, and place a compress over the phlebotomy site, and bind the area tightly, for it heals quickly.
Of cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping is done with horns, or with earthenware, or with glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and the extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping without scarification is in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And the cupping that is administered with scarification and blood extraction is applied to fourteen places on the body, of which one is at the nape of the neck, and is the back part of the head; and cupping in the middle of the two sides of the neck together; and cupping of the chin below the jaw, and below the mouth; and cupping of the two shoulder blades; and cupping of the armpits, and it is above the end of the breast; and cupping of the two elbows, and it is of the two arms; and cupping of the two thighs; and cupping of the two calves.
And cupping does not extract blood from the large veins, but from the small scattered veins in the flesh, and therefore it does not destroy the strength through them, as it does with phlebotomy; nor should cupping with or without fire be done for any illness caused by fullness, until the entire body has been emptied.
But if necessity compels cupping for illness or for a continuous condition, let it be administered at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle of it, and at any time.
And therefore, when any of these conditions occur, and especially if it is in the middle or third of the month, then we command cupping to be performed after two or three hours have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the neck is that when it relieves heaviness in the head and that which is pressing on the eyes; however, this should be done as part of the evacuation of the entire body.
And this cupping is in the location of the vein-letting of the cephalic vein.
And it is not permitted to use it on those who are cold and feverish, or in whom there is a cold, for it causes them great harm.
And therefore, it is not appropriate to use it on the elderly, and on those whose heads are afflicted with cold illnesses.
But for those on whom it is continuously applied, oblivion is caused; and therefore, you must instruct the cupper to gently lower the cupping jar to the lower parts, fearing the generation of oblivion.
But cupping with alcohol is in the location of vein-letting of the *vena fusca* and the *basilica*: and therefore, it is helpful for asthma, and the constriction of the breath and the tearing of the breath's instrument, and for coughs, and congestion.
And the alcohol cupping should be lifted slightly, for if it is placed too low, it generates weakness in the body and stomach.
And cupping with *alhagdahan* is helpful for accidental head pains, and ophthalmia, and migraine, and feverishness, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is a substitute for vein-letting from the *basilica*.
And you must instruct the cupper not to press their hand with excessive force during the scarification so as not to cut the artery and cause excessive bleeding.
And cupping under the chin is helpful for swelling in the mouth, and for corruption of the gums, and for similar mouth ailments, and it is a substitute for vein-letting of the *aliheric* veins found in the two lips.
But cupping done over the two shoulder blades is helpful for *caputanum* (a condition), which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two sides within the armpits is helpful as a substitute for vein-letting from three veins, namely the basilica, the *fusca*, and the cephalic, because it draws blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh, and the smaller veins draw from the larger veins until the drawing effect is transmitted to the three main veins.
And instruct the cupper not to press too hard during the scarification, because the area is lacking in flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
And a cupping treatment applied to the buttocks is helpful for hemorrhoids of the anus and for ulcers underneath.
And it is necessary to instruct the cupper to use a large, deep cupping glass, because the area needs a strong suction; and shallow, delicate cupping glasses are ineffective and should be avoided.
However, cupping on the legs is less effective, due to its obvious limitations, because they draw blood from the entire body, and help with long-standing pains in the kidneys and the bladder; and they provoke menstruation, and are useful for aching and inflammation; and they are a substitute for bloodletting from the two *sophenas* (possibly calves), and for leeches, and for two cautery irons.
However, they greatly weaken the entire body and cause fainting in many people.
And the benefit of cupping [applied to the body in this manner] is similar to the benefit of cupping both legs.
And the method of applying the cupping is to place the empty cupping glass initially and draw it gently with moderate suction, and do not prolong the application of the cupping glasses; rather, apply them lightly, leaving them briefly, so that the humours come to the area by flowing inward. And do not stop repeating this process and continuing until you see the area become red and swollen and the redness of the blood appears.
And then you make incisions and repeat the suction gradually, and then consider the position of the body parts.
For someone with delicate flesh who is easily bruised, you should make incisions only once, and no more, so that the area is not ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to deepen the incision slightly and to moderate the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then you should make incisions twice, because in the first instance, you open a path for the blood and its watery elements to drain out. But in the second, you examine the extracted thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick and foul, then a third incision should be made to remove the remaining impurities.
And finally, when we want to remove little blood gradually, a single incision is sufficient.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we make many incisions; and if we know the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make deep incisions.
And the depth of the incision should only be the length of the lancet's blade.
And if the skin where the cupping is to be applied is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, then the places of the cupping should be anointed with softening, opening, and dissolving agents; if it is summer, like almond oil, violet oil, soft chamomile oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is winter, then narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or blood-root oil, and similar ones.
And if the excess is thick and cold, then the oil should be amaranth oil, balm oil, almond oil, or dill oil, and similar ones.
But if the cupping is on a surface with wide pores and tender flesh, then it is necessary to avoid oil, and the areas for cupping should be washed with lotions or cold spring water, or poppy-seed water, or water of the borage, and similar things.
And if the blood is excessively moist, wash the cupping areas with sour wine, or with water of myrtle, sumac, and similar things.
And for those with thick superfluities, wash their cupping areas with old wine, or with water of St. John's Wort (likely a reference to a specific herb), or with a decoction of dill, or chamomile, and similar things.
And the cupping should be done before a bath;  afterwards, it should be administered shortly after the bath for an hour or two, and the patient should rest/sleep soon after the cupping.
What is it that should be regulated before cupping or bloodletting?
You must consider at the outset: if the person being cupped or bled is choleric and has sharp, inflamed blood, then they should take things that cool it, such as  mild vinegar, endive in sour wine, lettuce, drying herbs, and similar remedies.
And give them foods like poultry, and lean meats, and foods seasoned with vinegar, and similar things.
And for someone whose temperament is cold, they should drink  almond syrup, or syrup of fennel seeds, and sumac, and very fragrant, slightly aged wine.  They should be advised to consume little food and drink, and given foods like poultry, hemp seeds, small birds, and pigeons.
And on the day of cupping and bloodletting, the drink should be more plentiful than the food.
And certain men should be given a drink of theriac, or musk, or other similar medicines, before cupping or bloodletting, or soon after, to strengthen the main body parts and to make the blood more refined;  however, these shouldn't be taken hot.
But cupping, done without incision, should be applied to the liver, spleen, gouty areas, the navel, the kneecaps, and the groin area, for these parts cannot withstand incisions.
And this is not done for the purpose of blood extraction from the limb, but rather to draw out cold, stagnant air from the limb.  It's like applying a cupping to a breast in cases of nosebleeds; we use it to dissolve the cold, stagnant air from a limb, just as we do on the belly and navel.  Because this makes the limb less dense, warms it, and relieves the pain by removing the trapped air.
And it is placed on the temples when they are congested or inflamed, because through its strong drawing power, it quickly relieves congestion and eradicates inflammation from the area.
And similarly, it does the same when placed on the liver and spleen to remove the stagnant air contained within them.
And these cupping vessels are administered empty, only with suction; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping vessel is filled and becomes larger; it is either just warm water, or water in which herbs suitable for the purpose have been boiled.
The form of cupping administered with fire: let the opening be the width of two fingers, as we have formed it; and the quantity of the opening be half a palm; and it should be on the patient's back, in the location that is on the circumference, half of it, and the hole should be small, according to the size of a needle that could enter it.
Let it be made of red or citrus wood, with thick borders, lion, eagle, or triangular shapes, so that it does not move the limb from its position on it.
And there should be a transverse rod of wood or iron in the middle, where a candle with fire is placed.
And let this cupping be larger than the one we have described; and the smaller cupping be smaller than that, according to the illnesses and age of the person using it.
And the cupping for children and the weakened are different from the cupping for young people and those with robust bodies.
And the method of placing this cupping with fire onto the limb is to gently heat the surface with wood fire in front of a small wax candle, and place that onto the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cupping, so that the fire is ignited around the lower part, to prevent burning the patient's body.
And then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be on the hole we mentioned, until, when we have the cupping and don't want the finger to expose the hole and the vapor to escape, the cupping will then quickly dissolve.
And heat the surface according to its method, and repeat if you need to.
But in cupping administered for pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse rod nor hole, and it is administered only by filling it with water, and it is placed directly onto the limb.
And this is the manner of it:  The larger this cupping is, the better, so that it can receive a large quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs where cupping is impossible due to their small size, like the foot and gums and similar parts; or to limbs deprived of flesh, like the finger and nose and their similar parts.
And the quality of using those leeches is found in the clear, still waters of muddy places.
And then they [the leeches] should be left in fresh water day and night until they are hungry and no cause remains in their bellies; and then the body should be evacuated at the start with bloodletting and cupping; and then the limb of the sick person should be rubbed until it turns red; and then they [the leeches] should be placed upon it.
And when they are full and drop off.
And if suction of the area is possible with a cupping glass, it is better in terms of healing.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and afterwards with plenty of water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the body of blood around the attachment of the leeches, and it is oozing, then you immerse a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top until the oozing is stopped.
And if the blood is excessive, then sprinkle powdered vitriol, or similar astringent substances, on it until the blood is stopped; or place roasted bean halves over the area, and leave them until the beans adhere to the area, and the bleeding is stopped.
And if necessary, repeat the application of leeches, when possible changing them.
And if the leeches are prohibited from being used, then the area should be rubbed with fresh blood or a needle should be used to prick the area until blood flows; and afterwards, poultices should be applied, for when they sense blood, they immediately attach.
And when you want them to detach, sprinkle a little powdered aloes, or salt, or ash on them, and they will detach quickly.
Thus begins the treatment of the third part: of restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations that accidentally occur in the bones.
O, son, understand that foolish and vulgar doctors, and those who have never looked at the books of the Ancients or read a letter from them, boast of this chapter.
And for this reason, this method of the learned ones in our land is hidden; and I have not forgotten this at any time completely; and I have not embraced this that I have learned, except through the length of reading the books of the Ancients and studying their understanding, until I extracted their knowledge.
And now I will direct myself to experiment and study for the length of my life.
And I have already described in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge and upon which my experience has been passed; since I have shortened it for you and delivered it from the occupation of elongation; and I have shortened it at the end of the shortening; and I have shown it at the end of the explanation; and I have formed in it many forms of the instruments that are administered in it, as is done by adding explanation, just as I have done in the two previous chapters.
First Chapter.
A summary and collection of the nature of bone fractures, and the prerequisites needed before we begin to remember the fractured members and their various conditions. Therefore, let us begin this chapter with a summary of the subject matter; and the chapters to which the craftsman is first obliged to pay attention, and to establish himself upon the truth of those; that is, you and those who are eager to learn or acquire this noble art, from you.
And thus I say that when a fracture, dislocation, twisting, or injury occurs, then it is necessary that you first use phlebotomy or leeches, or both together, if no cause prohibits it, such as weakness of constitution, or if the affected person is a child, or an elderly person in decline, or if it is a time of intense heat or intense cold.
And thereafter, the patient's diet should consist of fresh herbs and poultry and game meats; and avoid fatty meats and foods that fill the veins with blood, until you are certain of a mature abscess, and if you do not fear an effusion of matter into the limb.
And then, return the patient to his former regimen, which was his usual way of life.
And therefore, once the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient should be given nourishing foods rich in nutrition, thick and heavy, in which viscosity is present, such as foods made of cooked wheat with water, and rice, and porridge, and pea soup, and veal stomachs, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wines and similar to these, and with this regimen, the fracture is more easily and better consolidated.
And know that broken bones in people who are in the prime of life and in the elderly, cannot be joined together and consolidated according to their nature because of the wasting away of their limbs.
But nevertheless, nature gathers and unites around the broken bone from every side some substance similar to glue, which is thickened and adheres and holds it together until it is entirely glued and joined, until it reaches the point of strength and firmness, just as with a fire at the beginning, until some factor prevents it from completing its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary that you give the patient foods that are heavy, viscous, and thick, as we have said.
And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the variety of limbs, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the foot bone is different from a fracture of the arm bone; and similarly, all other limbs have different types of fractures among them.
And I come with a recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its own distinct chapter.
There is a diverse range of fractures within itself.  (Or,  A diverse variety of fractures exists.) And the types of bone fractures themselves are diverse; for there is an arched fracture, and some that occur in a star-like pattern; and sometimes a fracture occurs along the bone's length: and these are fractures of the bone's shaft and splinters and resulting and non-resulting (or proceeding and non-proceeding) splinters, just as is done in a pen when it is prepared for writing, and there are fractures with a gap and a break in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And for every type, there is a particular method or treatment in restoring it, according to what is remembered in its distinct places (or, sections/locations).
A certain sign of a bone fracture. And by this a bone fracture is known: it is the twisting of it, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and this is of it when you press it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the location, nor is there a feeling of it when you touch the bone with pressure, and the patient does not experience significant pain, then there is no fracture here.
However, it is possible that there is a twist or a small crack, so you should not try to move it with your hand and a total compression. Instead, put some medicine on the affected area, remembering the type that is appropriate for this specific moment and place; and then it should be tightly bound with a subtle bandage.
And know that when the affected area is curved but not fractured in two or otherwise separated from its original alignment,  then you must begin, as soon as possible, to straighten it, lest a painful abscess occur.
And if an abscess forms there, then leave it for several days until the abscess subsides; and then bandage it using any method that you can to provide gentle and ingenious support.
And know that the restoration and reduction of a dislocated joint is easier than a fractured bone.
And then hold it firmly according to the instructions for its repair.
However, if there is a fracture, then extension of the broken limb, be it an arm or a leg, is necessary.  Use your hand if the limb is small, or two ropes, or one rope and a hand.
And your position in which you place the limb back into its natural shape, while the fractured parts of the limb are extended, will require you to skillfully and by any means you can, return those fragments to their proper places.
And be careful, using your strength, that your treatment of the patient does not cause further pain or injury; and strive, to the best of your ability, to fit the bone with its corresponding companion according to their best forms.
And it is necessary that you, skillfully, touch the affected area with your hand, and if you find any other cause, correct it and put it back into place to the best of your ability.
Avoid excessive stretching and compression, as some foolish doctors, often, cause boils or contractions in the limb through their treatment, as we have seen happen frequently in their practices.
The appropriate binding of the still limb is what I recommend; so that you know that broken limbs vary in size, shape and form.
And for those that are small, like the arm, finger, and forearm, a very fine cloth wrap is needed.
However, for larger ones like the thigh or leg, a strong, firm bandage is necessary, because a strong bandage binds the large limb tightly and evenly, so that nothing enters it.
And then, begin your treatment by applying a suitable bandage to the fracture site with three or four wraps, according to the limb's needs; and tighten your grip on the bandage slightly.
Then, take it (the bandage) to the highest point of the fracture site, and tighten it less than you tightened the fracture site. Then, gently lengthen the bandage at the fracture site a little, and loosen the tightening gradually, until you have drawn a substantial part of the bone back into place.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with a bandage, and then bring the wraps to the lowest part of the fracture; and let your operation be in the tightening of the bandage and in the loosening of it, just as we have said in the first bandage above.
And then place between the wraps a piece of linen or cloth, with which the twist of the fracture is covered, if there is a twist; and if not, do not place anything there.
And then place another bandage over this, and quickly cover these properly made bandages, if there is no inflammation or a painful abscess in the area. And if there is, place on it what will calm the abscess and reduce the inflammation; and leave it for a few days; and then you tighten the bandages over it.
And let the splints be of the half of a cane, carefully shaped; or of pine wood; or of palm fronds; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint placed over the fracture be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to the size and smallness of the limb; and then tighten the splints with another bandage, according to your first tightening; and then tie it over with thread properly, as we said about the tightening, and the tightening should be according to the location of the fracture, and the further it extends from the fracture, the looser the tightening should be.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and thinness, and they should be of flax; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the operation of some fools who use their thick cords, it is a great mistake, when the tightness is unequal.
And likewise, thin threads are not suitable, for you will not be able to achieve the desired tightness with those, and there should be at least a finger's width between splint and splint.
And if the patient is affected by the ends of the splints near the tight areas, then place under those some soft material, such as wool or carded wool, until it no longer causes him injury.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and an accidental rupture occurs in the bone, and I will return to that in the second chapter on the subject of singular occurrences.
And know that not every broken limb should be tightly splinted on the first day; the reason for this is that when the limb is large, splints should not be applied until approximately five or seven days, or more, depending on your confidence that suppuration will not occur.
And this is the method of plasters with which the Ancients repaired fractures, dislocations, and twisting injuries.
A common method of plaster for fracture repair, suitable for many complexions, particularly women and children, because it doesn't generate heat or cold:  Take powdered flour, specifically the fine flour-dust that collects on the walls of a flour mill.
And apply this as it is, but first sift it with egg white, and make the mixture not thick or thin; then use it.
Another method of plaster for repairing fractures, dislocations, and twisting injuries: a recipe using asafoetida, ladanum, acacia, enula, and wild millet root (probably a type of ground herb), all 1/4 ounce each; myrrh and aloe, 1/8 ounce each; and aloes, 1/2 ounce. Grind and sift all these ingredients, then mix them with either honeyed water or egg white if the patient's constitution is warm.  Use this plaster, as it is well-composed and helps mend slightly broken bones, and is helpful to many people.
Another method of plaster for fractures and twisting injuries:  a recipe using wild millet root (likely a type of ground herb) and white marshmallow root, 1/4 ounce each; myrrh and aloe, 1/8 ounce each; acacia, 1/6 ounce; and Armenian bole (a type of clay), 1/2 ounce.
All are ground in a mortar with thorough grinding, then sifted, and mixed with water or egg white, and applied.
A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and for pain, fissures, and fractures in those areas: take wool, soak it in vinegar and cooked olive oil, and apply it to the affected area.
However, this plaster does not have the virtue of repair; it is good for a painful abscess and effectively relieves pain.
Another method of plaster that repairs a broken bone: take leaves of prickly fig and leaves of wild poppy; grind them together and make a plaster from them.
A brief method of plaster for use in the repair of a fractured bone, and when you want to resolve the remaining abscess: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, and violet flowers, and flour of yarrow; grind them all separately, then mix them together and add wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then you must mix it with moist coriander water or water and use that.
Another, stronger plaster for resolving a stubborn abscess during the repair of a limb:  take roots of marshmallow, flaxseed, mullein, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, all separately ground, mix them together; all are to be mixed with willow water, or plain water, or wine,  according to the condition of the limb and the color/tone of its skin.
However, Hippocrates, in his book, does not say that a plaster should be placed on a fractured limb during its repair, but rather a cerate made from wax and oil, and nothing else; and recommends that it be of a medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.
However, in Gaul, it is observed that plasters are placed on fractured limbs during their repair, and those cases requiring desiccation with mild warmth, such as myrrh, frankincense, and similar to them, of those substances we have mentioned.
A plaster for injuries and pain: take equal parts of linseed, human skin (from a skinned animal, or bird skin), marshmallow, and salt; grind them together, sieve them, and make a plaster.
However, the length of time the bandage should remain in place, and when it should be removed, depends on whether pain, swelling, or displacement of the bone is evident.  If none of these occur, the bandage should not be removed for many days. And if there is intense pain, swelling, or inflammation at the site, then you must unbind or remove it immediately, and remove the plaster.
And take linen cloth and a wet marine sponge, immerse it in lukewarm water, and with this wash the affected area until the swelling subsides and the pain is relieved.  Then let the limb rest for an hour, and afterwards apply a layer of wool soaked in sour wine and oil (or olive oil), and bandage it for a night until you are certain that any inflammatory abscess is gone, the limb’s inflammation is reduced, and the pain has subsided.
And then reapply that subtle bandage and small plaster, but do not use the same amount of pressure as before.  Treat it gently until it is healed.
And if, at times, the abscess, soreness, pain, inflammation, and all other symptoms have completely disappeared, and you no longer require plaster and bandages, then you can reapply them in the same way as you did at the beginning.
And if no symptoms like those we have mentioned appear on the limb, then do not remove the dressings for three, four, five, or seven days; and sometimes all of this is left in place for twenty days, according to your assessment of the limb's condition, as we have said, until the fracture heals and the flesh around it is properly united.
And then adjust the bandage more loosely than your initial bandage, and adjust the patient's diet, according to the patient's recovery.
But if you find the fracture site has dried out and weakened more than necessary, then understand that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.  Therefore, moisten it with warm water every time you remove the dressing, and continue for three days.  Loosen the bandage slightly, and through this process, nourishment flows back to the limb, and it heals quickly.
However, what those foolish bone setters do when a limb fracture is not properly set at first, and they set it crookedly, is an error in their technique, a great danger.  If they were correct, the ancients would have described this in their books, and they would not have used such a method.
And I have not seen anyone of them do this, therefore it is more reasonable that it should not be done.
Second Chapter: Concerning Fractures When Occurring to the Head.
The types of fractures are numerous, and their shapes are diverse, and their causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow of a blunt instrument, and the blow shatters the entire bone down to the skull, just as it would a wooden log.  Thus, this type is called a comminuted fracture; or the blunt instrument cuts a part of the bone, and cuts the flesh without penetrating the bone behind it; and this type of fracture is called an incomplete fracture.
And the severity of these two types of fractures can be great or small, and there are fractures that are caused by crushing or grinding; their cause is a blow with a stone or a fall on a rock, or similar impacts.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or is on the surface of the bone.  The severity of these two types of fractures is either great or slight.
And there is a fracture that is hidden within the bone, in the smallness of a hair, and because of this, this type of fracture is called a hairline fracture.
And there is a fracture made either by a fall or by a blow from a stone or similar objects, which causes some part of the bone to be driven inwards.  It happens in the concave portion, like what happens to the teeth of a comb when struck, and part of their protrusion goes inwards.
This happens most often in the bones of moist bodies, such as the heads of infants.
And in all these types of fractures, the fragments are scattered like separated tiles. And I will come to reposition all of that in its place.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by probing them and by examining their surrounding areas for signs of decaying flesh.
A specific kind of fracture is recognized because a [capillary?] is exposed on the bone, and it is cleaned and probed, because the fracture appears dark/black.
But in the treatment of fractures, first consider the patient's symptoms, and if you see through the symptoms that they indicate manifest fear, such as vomiting of bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, and swelling and stiffness of the limbs, and similar symptoms to those in more severe conditions, without a doubt, it is not going to be cured/healed.
And if you see non-standard symptoms, you hope for recovery, then you begin the treatment.
The reason for this is that if the patient has come to you at the beginning of the illness, as it is with the plague, and this is during the winter days, then you must examine the bone's condition before the 14th day, according to all conditions.
And if it is during the summer days, then you must strive to examine the bone before the seventh day, lest the area below the bone be corrupted by the pannicle [a skin-like covering], and the symptoms we have mentioned occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the pannicle covering the brain, and is with small pieces and friction, then you must cut away the broken and frayed parts, as I will instruct you.
And you are to shave the head of the afflicted patient, and uncover the bone according to the custom and manner possible to you, considering the nature of the plague, and to be gentle with the patient.
And if you encounter bone exposure, blood flow, or a hot abscess, then you must oppose it with what is needed, and you should fill the area with cloths infused in wine and rubbed oil, and allow the plague to rest until the abscess is calmed, and the blood flow ceases; and then begin with the surrounding bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you cut the bone with a narrow incision tool, and this is its shape:  And then administer another incision tool, a little further out than the first; and this is its shape:
And then administer another incision tool further out than the second one.
And it is necessary that you have several different incision tools, some wider than others, and some shorter than others, with sharpened edges at their extremities, and made of hardened iron or steel.
And use them with ease in striking the incision tool so that you do not injure the head and damage it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary to pierce around it before you administer the incision tools with the drills, which are called non-deepening drills.
And they are not called this way except because they do not penetrate the surface of the bone at the point near it, because the drill has a round tip or edge at that part below the pointed head, that prevents it from sinking in and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each suited to the thickness of each bone, so that you have available in every skull a tip that is sharp, the length and shortness of which is according to the thickness of that particular skull.
And this is the method for three types of drills:  The method of piercing around the fractured bone is to place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know the bone is pierced; then change the drill to another location and place it at a distance equal to the thickness of the bone's width or approximately that.
Then you cut with the incision tools what's between each hole in the bone, making it as thin as possible, as we've said, until you separate the bone, either with your hand or with some other device such as pliers and delicate forceps.
And you must carefully ensure that the incision tool does not touch anything of the skull.
And therefore, once you have encircled the pierced bone and separated it from the skull if it is attached, and you have extracted it, you must scrape and smooth the rough surface of the bone with another tool similar to a knife, but it must be finer and more delicate than the other incision tools.
And if any small, jagged pieces of bone remain, then remove them easily with your tools; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments as we have described.
And another method of operation is gentle, free of fear, which Gualtier and Laetius described with great praise.  And this is their teaching: it is necessary for you at the beginning to start uncovering the area of the bone where the fracture is most severe and noticeable, until, when you have uncovered that area and placed under it the end of this gentle and pleasant incision tool, which is of this form:
It is that the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part extends in two directions along the length, as seen; so that the lenticular part is joined to the skull with the sharp cutting face against the bone.
Then strike the incision tool on one side with a small mallet until the entire bone is cut easily, as it is turned, and you are certain that the bone will not suffer the accident that you fear in any way.  And if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; truly, even if he were asleep.
Then if any piece remains attached to the bone in any part of the bone, cut that from it with the end of that lenticular incision tool, and remove it easily, for it is removed without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the flesh, and what has been cut off or removed from the bone is its surface, and roughnesses and fine jagged edges remain, then it is necessary to smooth those roughnesses and eradicate those jagged edges with fine razors for which you have prepared a number of various sizes so that you can administer the most suitable and most correct ones according to what you consider appropriate to your operation on the broken bone and its shape.
And it is necessary that in your process of smoothing the bone, you begin with the largest of those razors, and then progressively use the finer ones, and do not cease doing this in succession until you arrive at administering the finest and most subtle of all of them.
However, for each of the other small, capillary fractures and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer care according to what you deem necessary for its repair.
And it is a cause that is not hidden from all those who have studied in that art. And what we have written about this, we have shown in large fractures.
And if the flesh is retracted when you expose the bone, then it is necessary to take a cloth corresponding to the size of the wound, and soak it in warmed oil, and place it over the wound opening; then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and soak it in warmed wine and oil, and place it over the first cloth, doing this as gently as possible so you do not press on the flesh; and then apply a thick bandage, and do not tighten it except to the point where it holds the wound together.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are sure of a feverish abscess; then remove it and then administer medicines that are good for dryness, such as flax seeds, barley flour, ashes, and powdered aristolochia, and similar things.
And you should make a powder from these medicines, ground into a powder, and apply it to the wound, as they are dry; and universally, administer any medicine that is of a nature to cleanse and not to bite.
And watch carefully, as the wound in your treatment should be clean, and should not be tainted by ointment or anything else; nor should you allow the virulence to increase there. For when it is concentrated on the flesh of the brain, it corrupts it and rots it, and causes the sick person great and malicious harm.
And problems occur in the flesh of the head, when the bone is exposed, and especially when the treatment of it is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, if you see the patient having the symptoms we have described, know that it is dangerous without a doubt.
And if it is not blackness but from the medicine placed on it, and the nature of that medicine causes that blackness, then you should take one part of honey and three parts of olive oil, and with these, moisten a cloth, and then place that on the affected area; and then treat it with the appropriate healing spices until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the restoration of a broken nose.
Know that the nose is not broken in two separate, very serious ways, or in one of those ways occasionally, because you have two bones there, for the lower part is cartilaginous, and it is not broken, and you only see it with rubbing, twisting, and bending.
But if one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert your little finger into the nose, and use your index finger to hold that fracture inside, and your thumb on the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this easily, and be careful not to cause the patient pain with your procedure.
And if the fracture is in the most serious part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it should be straightened with the tip of a bone tool which has a small thickened area/handle.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same.
And try to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then approximately the 7th or 10th day, apply a poultice to the inflamed area.
And insert a piece of soft cloth into the nostril, if the fracture is in one part, or two pieces, if the fracture is in two parts, and each piece should be of sufficient thickness to fill the nasal opening.
Some ancient restorers said the pieces should be soaked in wine and changed daily, but I have not seen this.  Instead, the cloth should be dipped in beaten egg mixed with powdered lime, and leave it in place until the bone is set and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a cloth piece, a bird's feather wrapped in soft cloth is inserted into the nose,  especially if the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is not being prevented from breathing.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, do it with cloth pieces.
And if a further abscess arises, plaster the nose with a cerate or with cotton soaked in sour wine and rubbed oil, or with diachylon.
However, if no further abscess arises, then you should plaster the external one with sesame flour and powdered coriander seeds mixed with egg white; then place a soft bandage over it, and do not bind the nose with anything else.
But if the nasal bones are fractured, or have small splinters, then you must cut around them and remove them with the appropriate tools; afterwards, close up the wound and heal it with what promotes healing and consolidation, and with appropriate plasters.
And if a sore appears inside the nose, then you should treat it with cloth strips and administer lead tubes until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Of the restoration of the jaw when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by an open wound, observe if the fracture is only outward, and not broken in two but bent inward at the edges, then its reduction is easy.
And it is necessary, therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the said index finger of the right hand; and push the irregularity of the fracture inwards easily with the other hand on the outside of the bone; with that gently adjust it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary to administer extension to both parts according to straightness until its reposition is possible.
And if you encounter a movement of teeth with disruption, then tighten those that you expect to remain with gold, silver, or silk thread; and then place a compress on the broken jaw, then place a folded cloth over it, and place a large, well-made bandage, or a strip of cloth equal to the length of the jaw; and then tie it as your binding apparatus allows, and the application is suitable, until it is no longer damaged.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and give him easy-to-digest food.
And if you estimate that the shape has been altered in any way, then you should remove and loosen it on the third day; and then correct what has been altered and plaster it with ground powder, with egg white, or with chaff flour, after you have removed the compress, and place a soft wool plaster over it.
And then, when that plaster is properly attached and the bone's position is not altered, leave it; do not remove it until it is healed and the fracture is tight; for many times this fracture tightens within three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have often said for its resolution until it is healed and the abscess is resolved.
And if the fracture is with a plaque, then consider if it is a detached piece of bone or splinters; then you must carefully remove those splinters with what is suitable for their removal from instruments.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a lancet according to your needs.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then you should close the wound opening if it is wide; and if not, place one of the suitable plasters over it and allow it to heal until it is sound.
Chapter 5.
Of the restoration of the collarbone when it is fractured.
Many times the collarbone is fractured on the front part towards the muscle, and that fracture is done in one of three ways.
When it is broken, or separated, or separated into two parts, other than splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it is such that splinters are present, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is such that the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds and steadies the fractured collarbone, and the other extends the neck towards that area.
And then mold the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correct, neither protruding nor indented.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's neck a pad of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to your needs; and extend and raise the collarbone and compress the pad with your hand until you have correctly aligned the fracture.
And if you cannot pull the collarbone's end outward, because it has become stuck, then the patient should be laid on their back, and place a slightly larger cushion on their neck muscles.
And the assistant should press the muscles beneath to raise the collarbone from its stuck position, and then you should realign and mold the fracture with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the collarbone and they are loose, then it is necessary to cut around them and easily remove those splinters.
And if it is lodged in the bone, then you should make an incision there with one of the scalpels you have prepared for this, after placing the instrument that aids the splint under the collarbone; and this is a wooden or iron instrument whose shape is as follows:
And it resembles a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and its width should be according to your need, according to the size of the bone or its smallness.
But its length should be as is possible during the operation; it should have two ends like a vise, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the wound, which you have incised when extracting the splinter from the bone, is wide, and you are certain of a hot abscess, then you should join the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the wound is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's incision.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in sour wine, and rubbed oil and wine, and place it over it.
And be careful that the splint does not move from the broken bone; therefore, you must examine the patient daily, and when you see the ligament softened or the splint has come loose, then you should correct this and tighten the bandage.
And then place the patient's bedding over their neck, and place a small cushion under the patient's armpit beneath the bedding at night; so that with that the patient's arm is elevated away from the side, and thus the fracture of the collarbone (furcula) is elevated from the muscle; or the patient's arm is supported at the side of their neck.
And do not loosen the bandage unless there is a boil or abscess in the area, until twelve days have passed.
And then renew the plaster if you see the patient's skin reacting to it, and adjust the position and maintain it until the fracture of the collarbone is restored and healed.
And it is strengthened and comforted according to the month in 28 days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Of the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is fractured at its lateral aspect, and it is not the bone itself that is broken, but the edges.
And therefore when that place is fractured—and it is fractured in the middle of it—and it is not known except by touching, then, according to the fracture's appearance, you must prepare it and reduce it to its natural shape by whatever means are possible to you.
Then place on the area powder of ground stone mixed with egg white and lint; and then place a folded cloth pad; and then place on top of that a thin, flat piece of wood according to the size of the entire shoulder blade or a little more.
However, if beneath the wood there is a hollow in any part of the shoulder blade, then you fill that hollow with lint, and then raise the wood to a level.
And then hold it down firmly from above with a long bandage, with appropriate constriction, and with firmness of the wood until it is no longer displaced from its place.
And check the ligament each day; and every time it is softened, bandage it again and tighten it and adjust the wood if it has moved from its place.
And let the patient lie on their sound side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And therefore, when this number of days is complete, then you dissolve the bandage, and you should know for certain that it is from the bones whose connection is not feared, nor their dissolution.
And if you proceed from the area of the heavy bone and place the splint underneath, then you should cut around it, remove it, and act as we have described in the fracture of the furcula, to resolve the abscess, if one has occurred there.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the foot.
The foot sometimes breaks in the middle, and that heals slowly; but the extremities are often more easily fractured and shattered.
And the symptoms when the middle of the foot is broken are that it inclines to the inside, causing great pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, a strong fever, and vomiting blood; and the broken bone's cavity is apparent, not hidden from the sense.
And the restoration involves laying the patient on their back, placing a cushion between their shoulders; then applying pressure to their muscles and aligning their bones with the hands on both sides, proceeding carefully in the operation and adapting to all possible and appropriate ways, until the bone returns to its proper shape.
Then apply a plaster and bandage, placing a thin layer of willow or caligo (or similar lightweight material), and wrap that in a cloth; then carefully apply this bandage over the broken bone so it isn't disturbed.  Sometimes bind it in a rounded shape on the back, tightening it appropriately.  And constantly check the bandage, and when it's softened, tighten it further.
And if the bandage causes inflammation, suppuration, pain, or an abscess in the area, then you should remove and reapply it, and treat whatever has occurred with appropriate healing methods.  Then replace the plaster, if necessary, and continue adjusting the bandage until healed.
Chapter 8.
Of restoring broken bones.
Know that broken bones only occur in thick areas, like the back; and the damage to the ends and front portions of the bone happens only due to the cartilage there. And its understanding isn't hidden from the feeling/sense by investigation of it with words.
And the restoration is done by aligning the fracture with fingers in the best way possible, until it is aligned properly, and then apply a plaster and bind the broken bone with splints, if needed.
And if the fracture of the ribs is towards the inner parts, then the patient experiences intense pain and a stabbing sensation, just like the stabbing pain one experiences with pleurisy, and this is because the bone pierces the lining; and there is difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood; and this is a difficult condition to treat.
And the ancients were ingenious in that matter with many inventions.
And of what they said: it is necessary to give the patient foods that generate inflammation and gas, so that the belly is swollen and distended, and the fracture is pushed outward.
But we would avoid this, for it is not a light thing to cause a hot abscess, if it does not happen; and if it already happens, then it helps with that.
And some of them would say that a cupping glass should be placed over it and then that it should be suctioned forcefully; and this seems like a sound reasoning, but nevertheless, it is feared that the cupping glass will draw the superfluities to the area because of the weakness.
And some of them would say: the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is filled, that the dressing should be tightly wrapped around the area according to its roundness; and then the patient should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if a severe cause afflicts the patient, which they cannot endure, and the bone pierces the skin with a painful puncture, we fear for the patient, then it is necessary to open the area, expose the broken rib, and then place an instrument over that which will hold the rib in place—the memory of which has already been made—and that we cut the bone easily and extract it.
And then we bring the two sides of the wound together, if it is large, with stitches, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if you find an abscess inside, then you mix powders in heated oil and apply it to the area, and let the patient be treated with whatever is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And let him lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Of the restoration of a fractured vertebra of the spine and neck.
Sometimes there are fractures in the bones of the neck, and sometimes there is a grinding of them, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then consider this: if the muscles are already softened, numb, dead, and you cannot move them, stretch them, or squeeze them, and when you press them with your fingers or prick them with a needle, they feel no pain, then know that they are not healed, and in this state of affairs, death is imminent.
And if you move them and feel pressure with your fingers and pricking, then know that the bone's integrity is preserved and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if you see similar signs in the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if they will heal or not, then consider the patient's feet.
Then if you see that the feet are also softened, like what happens in the muscles, and when the patient lies on their back, they experience involuntary movement and urination, and sometimes are lying on their back, wanting to urinate but unable, then know that it is fatal, and do not bother with treatment.
But if you do not see any of those symptoms, the cause is better and less severe.
And the treatment for this is to apply a soothing poultice to the inflamed vertebra, either oil or crushed eggshells; apply it several times a day until the inflammation is soothed.
And then apply a comforting and stimulating plaster, and bind it firmly; and order the patient to rest and remain calm, and not sleep on the affected area until it is healed.
And if you find signs of bone fracture or any detached part, then it is necessary to cut away the skin and remove that bone; and then join the two edges of the wound, with stitches if it is large; and then treat it with a healing ointment until healed.
But if the back of the bone is broken, and it's at the end of the spine, then you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the rectum and align the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible by applying gentle pressure; and then apply a plaster and bandage if needed, and bind it tightly.
And if you find broken pieces in it, then you should remove those pieces, and treat the wound with the previous treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Of the restoration of the [broken] width/breadth.
The bones of the hips are often broken, and if they break, their fracture is only a separation at their extremities and they are cut along their length and deviate inward; and the patient experiences pain and throbbing at the site, and the leg is numb when fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is the figure of it.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you hold it together as best as you are able by approximation until it is aligned with its natural form.
But if the fracture is along it or has already shifted downwards, then you have the patient lie on their stomach until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. And therefore, when you have set it, place a poultice on it, then place a splint of wood or bone over that, and bind tightly so that you fear neither the puncturing of the fracture nor the movement of the splint.
And hold the cavity with whatever fills it until it takes on the tightness according to equality, and order the patient to sleep on their back or on their sound side.
But if a hot abscess arises, then cease the extension and restoration until the hot abscess is calmed, and place on it whatever calms it as is previously prescribed; then return to the restoration, and bind it as is fitting.
And if splinters or fragments of bone occur, then you remove them.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the restoration of the fractured limb.
Adjutori" is that which is between the elbow and the top of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness in this manner:
And having tied two bandages to its two ends, it should then be suspended from a raised position.
And have the patient lie on a stretcher; then gently place the patient's broken arm upon the piece of wood until the bone's tip is in the middle of the curved portion of the wood.
And then suspend something heavy upon it, or the assistant stretches it downwards; and then the physician holds the fracture with their hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
The other method is that the patient be placed on their back and the hand be supported by a bandage; and then command two assistants, one of whom will hold what is above the fracture with their hands, and the other hold what is below it; and each of them should pull in their respective directions.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you bind the fracture with one bandage and another bandage over that, and each of the two assistants should pull in their respective directions.
And therefore, if the fracture is close to the muscle's extremity, it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the bone and the other below the fracture, near the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed on that location and around that elbow.
Apply this with ease and without effort.  Then, when it is properly bound and applied correctly, secure it tightly lest a harmful abscess arise.
However, if a harmful abscess arises, then leave the tightness until the seventh day, and apply soaked wool to the area in sour wine and warmed olive oil until the abscess subsides. Then secure it tightly.
And the manner of securing it is to place a poultice over the fracture, then wrap a clean cloth over the poultice.  Then support the arm with this support, and place their open hand over their muscle (or the affected area).
And secure the cloth and the support around the arm so that the arm is in a straight position, if no reason due to the broken bone forbids this.
And then use splints.
And you should place over the fracture a splint that is wider and stronger than the others; and place the width of a finger between each splint, and the length of the splints should be according to the break, with the addition of three fingers on each side.
And then secure the splints with the binding I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And make sure your binding around the fracture area is tight. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the binding should be.
And therefore adjust the placement of the splints and the binding as we have said at the moment when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you do... (or, then proceed).
And if you fear a suppurating abscess, then you leave the binding and splints in place until the seventh day, as we have said.
And then consider the limb in all its parts for three days so that swelling or inflammation doesn't occur there; or food is forbidden to the limb because of a superfluity of binding; and then rectify everything according to what we have said.
But if you are confident that no cause of this will occur, then do not remove the bandage until approximately three days or more.
And let the patient's rest be on their back, and their hands on their stomach.
And place on the support a poultice full of wool, and consider at all times of night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not distorted or that the bandage is not softened; therefore, rectify all this with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order we previously mentioned, so that the food is subtle at the beginning until it begins to be strengthened; and then you must make the food heavier.
Because according to the custom of the support and the limb, they are to be tightened for 40 days; and then they must be loosened, and a bath administered and medicated with ointments that correct that.
And if the fracture is badly bruised, then do not loosen the bandage and splints for that injury until a few days or until two months.
Chapter 12.
Of the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called "two braches"; of which one is small, and it is the one that sits next to the said thumb, and the other is large, and is the one that is positioned under the small finger, on the lower part.
And frequently the larger bone is broken alone, or the smaller one, and frequently they are both broken together.
And when the smaller bone above is broken, then the restoration of it is easier, and its healing is more straightforward.
And when the bone below is broken, the fracture of it is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And even worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the small bone above, then it is appropriate for the physician, in order to facilitate its restoration, to apply a small extension until it is healed.
But if the large bone is broken, then a more forceful extension is necessary.
And if both bones are broken together, then you must apply the compression very strongly.
And you must position your hand in a way that supports the restoration and extension, resting it on a cushion.  The palm of your hand should be higher than all the other parts, the thumb should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be lying on a smooth, hard surface (possibly a board or similar).
And there should be a cushion in front of him, at his height, so that the patient does not feel strain.
And then the assistant stretches the lower arm with their hand or a bandage, and another assistant similarly stretches the upper arm.
And then the physician manipulates the bone until it is reduced to the best possible position.
And if in the fracture of the bone, there are irregularities, then you must strive to reduce every piece to its proper place with your skill.
And if there appears a detached fragment that pinches the tendon, and you are not hopeful of restoring it, then you must operate on it and remove it according to the method we described above.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already written a separate chapter about that, and therefore take care of its treatment.
And if you encounter a suppurating abscess at the beginning of your treatment, then you should apply a cloth soaked in a cerot made of olive oil and white wax, and it should be medium in thickness and subtlety, and tightly bandage the cloth over it until the abscess subsides; and then remove the cerot and apply a prepared plaster of ground powder mixed with egg white, and then place a bandage; and the bandage placed over the fracture should be large and strong.
And know that the names of the bandages for the arm are varied in their arrangements, that is, whether the fracture is in one compartment or two compartments together.
And then apply your bandage to the fracture site as firmly and intensely as possible, and moreover, if the bandage is applied to the upper parts of the fracture or to its lower parts, then apply the bandage a little more loosely, according to what was previously mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, not hard or rough, and the bandage with which they are tied should be neither too fine nor too thick, medium as we described.
And observe the limb and the ligament for several days. And if any cause requiring correction arises, such as swelling occurring in the limb, then you should immerse the limb in warm water until the swelling subsides.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the constriction is now softened and the bone is now rejoined and similar to the others, then correct all of this with your skill.
And consider further if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excess constriction, for then it is necessary to soften that slightly and leave it for several days until nourishment flows to it, and then bind it firmly.
But if the patient does not exhibit any of the causes we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to unbind it for approximately twenty days or thereabouts.
And then, the patient's hand should be suspended by its own ability to move actively, and let him sleep on his side.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or 32 days, or quite quickly in 28 days, and all of this is according to the disposition of the complexions and the patient's constitution.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the restoration of fractures of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures of the wrist and the joints of the fingers often occur from forceful impact, and sometimes from repeated friction.
And when the hand suffers a fracture or injury from friction, then it is necessary that the patient lie down, and extend the injured hand in a straight line with the body.  Then place the patient's hand on that extended position.
And then the attendant stretches the broken bones, and the doctor binds them together until they are properly rejoined.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and bandage, lest an abscess arise; then place a splint over it, according to the size of the wound, and you have already wrapped this in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the parts inside the palm of the hand, then make a bandage in the shape of a sling, and instruct the patient to hold it with their injured palm; then tie it with a long bandage.
And let the splint be of leather, with a cloth in which it is supported, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and tie it as necessary.
But if the fracture is in the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a splint over it, and another splint below, on the palm of the hand, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the bandage, as if the hand is turned towards the wrist between the fingers with ligatures.
And if a fracture occurs in one of the finger joints, then if it is the thumb, it should be splinted as necessary, and then it should be held with the palm and, if you wish, place a small, straight splint on it to elevate the fracture and prevent it from moving.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, the index finger, the ring finger, or the pinky finger, then it should be splinted and bound with the finger next to it; or all should be bound together, following a continuous line, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and afterwards, the placement of a warm poultice and its opposition – with your operation – with whatever is necessary when any such cause occurs, according to how the account of it has been repeated.
Chapter 14.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is frequently broken and is recognised by the symptoms as it is shifted to the front and uppermost part.
And the restoration of it is done so that the ligament is tightened over the fracture and another ligament is placed below the fracture, and the patient lies on their stomach and on their face.
And then the physician stretches all the ligament to its proper position, when the fracture is in the middle part of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then the ligament should be positioned near the knee to the groin area, so that the extension is in line with it, and the other ligament below the fracture.
And similarly, if the break is near the knee, then the ligament should be positioned near the knee, and the extension should be in the lower areas.
And then the physician aligns the bone with both their hands until it returns to its natural shape and the bone is properly joined; then it is necessary to apply a poultice and a bandage, otherwise the limb might become infected. But if it becomes infected, then you leave it for a few days until the infection subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be applied like this: it is necessary to wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, fold it two or three times, and remove any excess; then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long splint between the thigh and leg near the knee in the lower areas, and let the ends of the splint extend from the most superior part of both sections, and then wrap the excess of the bandage around the leg and thigh.
And then place splints over the thigh at the location of the fracture, and place one splint on the bone of the leg.
And then fill the gaps between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the fracture is consolidated.
And then begin with a strong bandage in the middle over the fracture site using three or four wraps, and the farther you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, the weaker and lighter and softer the bandage should be.
And then extend the two ends of the splint down to the ankle of the foot, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage does not shift from its position.
And then leave the bandage on it, so that no swelling, abscess, or inflammation, and similar conditions, affect the limb; and if any such thing happens, then remove it gently, and correct whatever has happened right away, as we have said many times.
But if there is a piece of bone protruding, then you must pull it back as best you can; and if not, cut over it and leave it, and treat it with whatever is previously prescribed until it heals.
And sometimes this thigh fracture is tightened with splints, just as we have said about splints for the arm.
However, in the restoration done in this manner, the patient does not develop a limp; and if it is restored on its own, or with the other leg applied, then it is necessary that the one which has always limped does so.
And know that the thigh is bandaged for forty days, or a little more or a little less, and all of this according to the diversity of the constitutions and other conditions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of the fractured kneecap (or patella).
Know that a fracture of the kneecap (patella) often results, but it frequently causes considerable attrition (wear and tear).
However, if it does result in a fracture, it is then only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a plaster, and concerning all of this, it has been with feeling.
And the restoration of it is thus, that what is broken in its parts is glued together using the said materials until it is joined and conjoined as much as possible by means of appropriate application, ease, and craftsmanship.
Then place a plaster and lay it over that round bandage, if you need it; and bind tightly over it with a suitable bandage.
And now consider all the methods we have described in other fractures, just as in an abscess or similar situations, so that it is opposed to any accident with whatever is appropriate, until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of the restoration of a fractured leg.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, one of which is thick, and is called the thigh bone; and the other is thin, and is called the shinbone.
And the treatment for any type of fracture of these bones is similar to that for fractures of the arm, and the restoration is therefore the same, the procedure being identical.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is dislocated in all directions.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is displaced forward.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you find it below, and it is one of those things that isn't hidden from you.
And then administer extension, reduction, and ligature of the splints accordingly.
However, if the fracture of the leg is extensive, having many splinters, the extension should be less forceful and lighter, and ease it with your skill.
And if there is any reason for operating on the arm, and when you adjust the splints and complete your operation, then you will take pieces of wood, pine being the best, which are placed under the supports that are placed on the bed, also made of palm branches; choose those with a small thickness, and none should be bulky.  Their length should correspond to the length of the leg, from the top to the very bottom.
And then wrap each with a cloth in two layers according to its length, placing one on the leg portion on one side and the other on the other side, from the top down to the lowest part of the foot.
And then tie the two splints in three places: at both ends and in the middle.  With this binding, the leg is prevented from bending to either the right or left side, and it is securely positioned.
And now a small wooden brace, corresponding to the length of the leg, is placed on it to prevent movement.
And this is especially necessary for fractures, and when there is a clear break.
And henceforth, examine the leg each day, and carefully monitor it for abscesses, inflammation, or other similar problems.  If any such problem arises, then apply the appropriate remedy until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the ankle and bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the ankle doesn't occur very often; however, fractures of the foot bones do happen sometimes; and fractures of the toes are rare, and they mainly sustain friction rather than fractures in their usual positioning.
And if the foot bones experience a fracture, and those bones are displaced, then the patient should place their foot on the ground in a prepared position, as if walking.
Then place one foot on what is elevated by those bones, and gently press and push them until they return to their proper places.
Then apply a plaster and bandage over it, and place a small, flat board with two smooth ends underneath the sole of the foot.
And then tightly bind that with a bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other materials as needed.
And when three or four days have passed, then you loosen the bandage, for you will find the bones reduced, or broken, or dislocated, and the operation for those is as you know.
But if any bones are broken, then set them, and bring them together as I have recounted to you in the setting of the fingers of the hand. And then place a splint along the length of the broken finger, and slightly wider than it; and then beneath the foot, this board as previously explained to you, and bind it tightly with a proper bandage.
But if what is broken of the bones is two, three, or more, then you place on each finger a splint of its size, wrapped in linen, and tightly bind the board to the lowest part of the foot, and let one end of the board be outside the belly of the foot so that it has good support.
And it is fitting for you not to forget that you consider all the things that I have told you about other fractures and accidents that we have discussed; and prepare yourself for any accident with what is necessary.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the thigh bone, the hip bone, and the penis of the man.
When the thigh bone of a woman is fractured, then make a splint of treated wood, and then slightly incline it towards the back, and keep it behind.
And then the midwife fills the thigh with wool, and it should be placed in the thigh just as before; and then the woman should be quieted, and lift her back slowly, since everything is displaced until the thigh is in front of the area as before and the broken bone returns.
And then place cushions on her back, and when she wants to urinate, she will remove the wool easily and urinate; and reduce and return it according to the method by which it was applied at the beginning, and then return it to its original position.
And do this for seven days or so, for that is how it is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and insert a reed cannula into the wound; and put the entire bladder into the thigh, and then blow into the cannula with force until the bladder is inflated inside the thigh, so that the fracture returns.
And then it should be filled with wool and remain so for several days, as we have said, until it is healed.
And when the hip bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and setting what we have described for a broken hip bone.
And what is correct is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which heal slowly, especially for those who have some study and use and understanding of this my book's words; for that fracture signifies to you in the greatest ways a correct path in the restoration and tightening of it, so understand well.
But in the case of a broken penis, take a bird's nest, and place the penis in it; then place a bandage of cloth over it, wrapping it up, and leave it for three days or so, and it will heal.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of fractures of bones when it is with a plague.
It is convenient for the one who suffers a fracture with a plague, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thighbone or the shinbone, or similar to those, that you should bleed him/her immediately if the conditions for bloodletting allow you to do so as mentioned above.
And if the plague causes blood to flow, then you must apply a poultice to the area to retain it, even if you pulverize a crushed stone, if no other remedy is available.
And then begin restoring the fracture on that same day, and do not delay, unless an abscess develops.
But if a severe abscess develops, then you should delay the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not approach it in the third and fourth days at all, for you will cause harmful accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the exposed skin, then it is necessary to carefully reduce it and hold it in place with your hands, with ease and minimal stretching.
However, if stretching is not suitable for you and repositioning it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, whose length is seven or eight inches, and whose width depends on the size of the injury; and therefore it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them, depending on the amount needed for treatment of any type of fracture.
And let it be round, and have little thickness so that it is not bent under the pressure on it during the operation.
And it should have a sharp tip, with a bevel on its edges; and its top should be thick, tapering down from the middle towards the ends.
And this is its shape:
And it is called in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", meaning a small spatula.
So that the pointed end must be placed elevated on the prominent bone end.
And you push it in one go until the bone returns, and it is secured with some binding.
And therefore, strive to bind the fractured ends together.  And if the broken end is small, and it doesn't accept the instrument well, then you must cut the end of the bone until the instrument can properly grasp it.
But if you cannot fully reduce the bone with what we have described, then cut it with whatever surgical instruments are appropriate; or saw it with one of the saws, in whatever way is possible for you.
And then remove any remaining rough edges and small splinters from the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, and the patient feels intense pain after the reduction, then know that the bone has not been returned to its natural place; and then do what you deem best to greatly benefit the patient.
When your bone repair is complete, then immerse a cloth in black astringent wine, and, specifically if it's summertime, do not apply a plaster or any other oil-based substance to the wound, lest it cause swelling and corruption.
And after, administer styptics at the time of your bone repair completion, and leave the wound uncovered, so that you cut the opening with forceps and apply dressings according to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to constrict the wound with the fracture, for foolish physicians have often done this, causing death or a corrosive or wasting illness in their patients; that is, gangrene. And if your constriction is slight, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or is a bad wound, and you fear any of the bad accidents we have mentioned, and find pain in the area, then it is not appropriate to apply styptics, but make a dressing of hard cloths instead of styptics and bind it tightly.
And when, after a day or two, pus begins to form in the wound, then you remove the cloth you placed over it with wine, and then apply poultices, ointments with which, according to our custom, we treat wounds, such as tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is necessary for you to loosen the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is healed and closed, and the limb must be prepared in such a way that the pus flows from it to the lower parts with ease.
If the wound has passed many days and is not healed nor is the pus discharged from it, then know that there are hidden complications, and you must investigate the wound with probing. And of those complications, those that are separable, remove and extract them; those that are not separable and cause pain to the limb, force you to cut into them, as far as it is possible for you.
And if the wound becomes inflamed or swollen, or other forms of corruption or putrefaction occur, then you must apply a remedy for that, as is appropriate for the treatment, of which a description precedes in its chapter.
And in this, where my discourse ends and you must apply your skill: when a large bone is broken, treat the limb as with a thighbone or similar large limb bones, and do not attempt to pull it out, or to extract it, because death often results; leave it until it can heal, for it will fall into place by itself in about 20 or 30 days.  Then treat the wound if you see fit, and if not, leave it.
Chapter 20.
Of the treatment of swelling that occurs in the area of a fracture.
Often this swelling occurs around the area of fracture healing, especially close to the joints, and it deforms the shape of the limb.  And it greatly hinders the natural function of the limb.
Then consider if the swelling is recent, and apply medicines that have a drawing or astringent effect, such as aloes, and henbane, and myrrh, and ceruse, and similar substances; use some or all of them, and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or vinegar, and place this mixture on the swelling over a piece of cloth, firmly bandaging it.
And maintain this bandage for several days without loosening it. Then remove it and apply another, until the swelling is gone; or apply a lead plate gently, for lead has the property of reducing any swelling in the limbs.
However, if the swelling has hardened and become tight, and it's necessary to remove it forcefully, then carefully cut it at its most prominent part, cutting away the excess and prominent material, or break it up with certain tools until it is removed.  Then treat the area until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the restoration of a fracture, when it is restored and afterward the limb remains weak and frail, not according to its natural state.
When a fractured bone is restored, and afterward the limb remains weak and frail, this is caused by many things: one is an excess of loosening of the ligaments and the binding done improperly; or by an excess of tight binding of the ligaments, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or by excessive poulticing; or by unnecessary movement not at the right time; or by lack of blood in the patient's body and weakness.
And the cure for this is to give the patient food and make their body soft until the blood is replenished; and administer baths; and introduce joy and cheerfulness upon them.
And then apply poultices to the limb, so that the poultice draws more nourishment to it, or continue applying warm water poultices, until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Of the treatment of broken bones when they are improperly set and prevent their proper operation.
When an already repaired limb shows signs of improper healing, such as crookedness and prominence at the fractured bone, and this results in a deformed limb, but the limb is nonetheless not hindered from its natural function, then you should not accept the claim of someone who asserts that the limb is newly broken.
But many foolish doctors and healers have done this in our land; and this practice is highly reprehensible, leading to great fear, a sign of which is deadly.
However, if lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be treated with warm water in which are soaked softening herbs, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar ones; and an emollient plaster should be applied, such as a well-made diachylon; or a mucilage from marshmallow root should be made, mixed with goose fat or beeswax oil, and applied as a plaster; or fatty figs should be crushed with pigeon dung, and similar medicines known as consolidating remedies.
And sometimes it is dissolved with persistent gentle rubbing with moist hands, and movement of the limb in all directions should be administered at all times.
However, if the twisting has progressed and become strong, hardened, and requires treatment with iron, then the swelling above should be released, and the continuation of the bone should be dissolved, and what is superfluous in the swelling of that bone should be cut away with delicate instruments, and ease should be administered with care and diligence.
Chapter 23.
Concerning dislocations.
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper position, preventing movement, distorting the shape of the limb, and causing significant pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is essential to quickly attempt reduction, and not delay it, for if delayed, the joint becomes inflamed and stiff, making dislocation reduction difficult.
And for this reason, it should not be moved or stretched during the inflammation stage, as it frequently causes spasms and worsening pain.
But when this happens, it is necessary that you apply a poultice to the affected area of the patient, and let it remain until the inflammation subsides; then, the limb should be bathed in warm water and oil, and the reduction should be attempted easily.
And every limb is thus treated, so that the memory of its place returns. (or, so that it will return to its proper place)
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocations, following the precedent for fractures; from the most superior part of the body to the most inferior part.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the treatment of a lower jaw dislocation.
So, if both jaws are dislocated quickly; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their sockets and softened a bit; or they are completely and fully dislocated, until they are softened at the joint,  to the point where saliva drips from the patient, and the patient cannot hold their jaw shut or close their mouth, and the patient's tongue is entangled in their speech.
However, when the dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns on its own with little effort.
But if the dislocation is complete and full, then it is necessary to administer a gentle reduction of it, and not delay at all.
And it is necessary for the attendant to hold the patient's head, and for the physician to insert the fingertip of one hand into the site of the jaw dislocation inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or to insert both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of the hands are outside, supporting; and order the patient to relax the jaw and allow the jaw to move from each side; and the physician supports the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are completely dislocated, then administer vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easier, and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And thus, when they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place upon them cloths (made of linen) with a plaster, to be made of melted wax and oil; and afterward, be bound gently with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be supported between two cushions, so that it does not tilt to the right or left side; and do not force him to chew on anything; let his food be soft and bland, until the pain has subsided and the jaws are healed, then let him eat whatever he wants.
And this should be administered gently, and do not force the opening of the mouth for eating, drinking, or breathing, until the jaw is healed and sound.
And if the reduction of the two jaws, when dislocated at any time and not returned to their places, then often fever and continuous sweating occur, and the patient's stomach is easily agitated, and easily vomits pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is a sign of impending death; and often the person affected dies within a few days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated from its connection within by its attachment to the foot; and sometimes it is dislocated outward, and this is evident to the touch.
And the restoration of it is that the patient lies on their back and extends their arms. And then apply pressure to the area with your palm with firm pressure, for it will return.
And then place a plaster and powders over that area and compress it.
However, the extremity that is attached to the elbow and continues from it is not dislocated in any way; therefore, it must be reduced and healed as we have said, and as is appropriate for your treatment.
And then place a plaster, powders, and a binding over that area, and instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until it is healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated from above the muscle, and this is done with difficulty; and it is not dislocated to the posterior parts by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the anterior parts by the nerves.
And most often it is dislocated and comes out from the lower parts toward the upper part, and especially in those where the flesh is scarce, it is easily dislocated; but in those in which there is much flesh, it is expelled with difficulty.
And often an accident occurs to some men through a blow or fall, and their muscle is inflamed with a hot abscess, and is believed to be dislocated because of this.
Therefore, you must examine this until you are certain about it, and then you should proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts toward the upper part, so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, for you find a clear difference between them; and you find a concavity at the head of the muscle and below the upper part, near the contact point of the head of the muscle, like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor more movement of that area.
If it is dislocated towards the feet or upwards, and you then find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
And a mild reduction of this dislocation is made when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises the patient's hand upwards; then gently places your hands below the upper part, and lifts the joint firmly into its place, and the minister raises the patient's hand, and extends it upwards; and then gently places it down, for it will return easily.
But if, despite what we have said, it does not return, and it has been a significant time since the dislocation occurred, then the patient must be bathed in warm water and given a poultice that softens and smoothes, such as a mixture of the roots of althea, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be applied.
And then the patient should be placed on their back, and a layer of wool placed underneath their upper leg, ensuring it is neither too loose nor too tight.  Then the physician places their foot on the wool, and gently lifts the muscle head, pulling the patient's hand so it does not move downwards, and another assistant supports the patient's head, preventing it from moving downwards.  This way the dislocated joint will quickly return to its place.
And if desired, reduce it in this manner: have a man present who is taller than the patient, standing on the affected side. He should place his arm under the patient's upper leg and lift it upward until the patient is suspended in the air. Another assistant should pull the patient's hand downwards from below their abdomen. But if the patient is light, then something else should be suspended with it, to add weight, for this will cause the dislocation to return quickly.
And it is easily reduced by another method: a long wooden post, shaped like a mortar pestle, neither too thick nor too thin, is placed on the ground under the patient.  After placing the patient over the top of the post, a strong cloth is used, and the patient stands with their body aligned with the post's length, and the patient's hand is stretched downwards on the other side. The patient's body is then forcefully stretched away from the other side; the joint will return to its place quickly.
And if the reduction is difficult by all the methods we have mentioned, then use this treatment: take a piece of wood two arms long and four fingers wide, and its thickness should be moderate at the level of the upper leg, in this manner:
And strong cloth should be tied around the rounded top of the post to prevent it from injuring the patient.
Then place the post under the patient's thigh, and stretch their arm or hand along the post, down to the lower parts, and tie the post to the support, arm, and hand.
Place the arm on a support (like a ladder) that is the proper width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the other side of the body is suspended (or pulled) to the other side, for the joint will quickly return to place.
And when the reduction is complete by any means possible, you must place a layer of wool under the thigh; then apply a prepared plaster of ground powder with vinegar and egg white over all the muscles, wrapping it around; then apply a proper bandage under the thigh; the bandage is wrapped over the plaster, and the patient's hand is tied to their neck.  Leave it in place and do not move their hand for seven days.
And the patient's food should be light, until the limb is strengthened, for this will aid in their recovery.
Then the diet should be increased after seven or five days, and some movement should be encouraged.  If it is firm and not softened, then it is now healed.
However, if the joint has been dislocated multiple times due to moisture or another cause, then a cautery with three punctures should be administered, as described previously in the chapter on cauteries.
And if all of this is done, and after seven days the bandage and the joint are not fixed, and the plaster and the bandage have been readjusted multiple times, and it is not fixed, and it cannot raise that arm to its upper limits, then know that the nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are either cut or extended or softened, and know that the joint will never return to its proper place.
For dislocations of the foot and the breast or the back, reduction is achieved by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to its place.
And another bandage should be applied to that area, and it should be treated until it is healed.
And if after healing there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use baths frequently until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its initial natural state.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the treatment of elbow dislocations.
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and more prominently in the front and back directions.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it is evident through the examination or touch, depending on the form of dislocation.  And when you align the dislocated elbow by the arm, this is plainly evident to you, for the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch its own muscle.
And you should act quickly, and reduce the dislocation before it becomes acutely inflamed, for if it becomes acutely inflamed, the reduction is difficult, and the limb is not completely healed.  And especially when it's in the posterior parts, for it is the worst of all other types of dislocations, causing the most pain, and often leads to death.
And the restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's arm should be extended with two hands, and their arm should be straightened. The physician's hands should be on the elbow, below it, and they should press the joint with the tips of their fingers together, or with the base of their palm, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the anterior parts, then it returns by bending the arm with their hand, until the physician strikes the elbow with the base of their palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous extension and strong force.
And it is that two assistants extend the arm, and hold that extension so that it is not pulled back from the extension.
And then the arm should be turned in every direction, since it is wrapped with a long folded cloth over the patient's hand, or bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with their hand, anoint it with some oil so that this helps in the lubrication of the joint with ease; and then push the joint with a forceful impulse until it returns.
And after the reduction, it is necessary to place it on a compress in which there is astringency and application with egg white, and it should be tightened with a descending constriction, and the arm be suspended from the neck, and left for several days.
And then it should be loosened; and so, if the joint is formed in its place, then you loosen the bandage from it and leave it.
And if you see the joint is not well-strengthened, then you repeat the poultice and the bandage, and leave it for several days until it is strengthened; and then loosen it.
But if there is a worsening after the reduction of the joint, and its condition is moving, then administer moistening in a bath and gentle friction, and compression, until it is relieved; or place something oily on the affected joint; and then bandage it and leave it over the bone day and night. And then remove that, and put the affected area in a bath; and when it sweats, then you rub the joint with gentle friction, and then repeat the application of something oily, once, and the second time, and the third. with the aid of the bath, until it is healed.
And if you wish, place a warm, moist cow's hide over the affected area and bandage it tightly; and do this several times, for it is moistening and restoring it to its proper condition.
Chapter 28.
Of the treatment of a dislocated shoulder, that is, of the joint between the arm and the hand.
A dislocated shoulder sometimes occurs, and the reduction of its dislocation is straightforward; the opposite is true for other joints. However, speed is required in its reduction the moment it is dislocated, before the area becomes inflamed or develops a painful abscess.
And the reduction of the dislocation is that you place the patient's arm joint on a table, and the assistant extends the arm. The physician then places their hand, or palm, over the area above the joint, and pushes until it returns to its proper place.
However, it is necessary to consider if the palm is already turned towards the stomach of the hand. In that case, the patient places the back of their hand on a table, for extension and reduction.  If the dislocation is on the back of the hand, then the hand of the assistant should be placed flat on the table, so that the physician's hand can press directly on the area above the joint.
And if it returns quickly, it is well; but if not, then gently compress the area avoiding the formation of an abscess and leave it. Do not repeat this, for otherwise you will not be able to achieve a successful reduction after several days.
However, if the joint remains in its dislocated position, and the patient feels no pain, but the hand feels numb and cannot grip, then you should know that the nerves are broken or damaged.  In this case, there is no cure for the dislocation, but it should be compressed with a cautery near the point of damage.  A strong and constant pressure will induce some effect.
Therefore, once the dislocation is reduced, apply a compress as previously described and leave it in place and compress it for five days. Afterward, the compress should be removed and the patient's hand exercised.
But if the patient's movement is restricted and some heaviness develops, then alleviate it with warm water and some rubbing several times until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
Of the treatment of finger dislocations.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in various ways.
And when any of these fingers are dislocated toward the palm side or the back of the hand, then straighten the finger and push the dislocation back with your fingers, until it returns to its place.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it was dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is properly aligned in its socket.
And when night comes, bind it according to that description, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for several days until it is straightened.
And do the same if it is dislocated towards the back of the hand, and bind it to that side and perform your first operation until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts of the body.
Chapter 30.
Concerning the treatment of dislocations of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation of any vertebra in the back or neck occurs, and many vertebrae are removed from their places, then there is no cure in that case, for death awaits the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's bowel movements are involuntary and they cannot control them; and often some of their limbs, or one or both legs or arms, are paralyzed, or a vertebra is out of place, because frequently they are displaced and sometimes the removal is in four different directions.
Therefore, this has already moved to the rear and is called a dislocation.
However, the treatment for this is that you should consider if the dislocation occurred in childhood, because then there is no cure for it, nor is it completely healed.
But for those that occur through accident or impact or similar causes, the Ancients described various methods of treatment at length, of which the most beneficial are retained; however, I will briefly summarize the most essential points, avoiding the unnecessary length, due to my closeness to the understanding of my exposition, by which I have explained and formulated this from diverse sources; from which I will demonstrate and clarify this.
And of those, only the one that occurs in the back, specifically as I describe, is curable.
And it is necessary that the patient be stretched out on their face, close to a wall, and be supported under them with soft material to prevent the foot from being damaged.
And then a straight pole should be placed, driven into the ground near the head of the patient, and another pole placed at the patient's feet at the opposite end of the slope.
And one attendant should hold the pole, and it should not be fixed in a hole; and another attendant should hold the other pole in the same manner.
And then wrap a strong linen bandage around the patient's head and under the forehead; and extend the end of the bandage to the pole placed at the head, and tie it there; then, tighten the other bandage around the patient's hips, thighs, and legs; and then fasten all the bandages and tie them to the other pole positioned at the feet.
And now, each attendant should extend the bandages towards the pole, and the two poles and bandages should not be moved from their positions, but not so firmly secured as we have described.
And the physician places their palms on the spine with force until it returns, or places a board there, and then the patient should adjust their feet on the board until they return to a normal position.
But if it does not return in this way, then take a board whose width or length is approximately three arms' length, and excavate a space in the wall near the patient where the end of the board fits inside. Then place half of the board over the spine, and the physician places their feet on the other end, and presses firmly until the spine is straightened and returns to its place.
And if you wish, use a turning implement held by hand; and you should place two poles, each one arm's length long, in the ground behind the patient's head and two more behind their feet; and let the space between each pair of poles be one handspan.  Make a hole in each pole for the turning implement to fit into, and securely fix each pole in the ground to prevent it from moving.
And place a round post on which the turning implement is placed, and rotate it through the two holes in the two poles.
And at the end of it [the round post] is a hole into which the pole [the round post itself] fits, the length of which is one handspan along with what is being turned; and in the other two poles is something similar to this.
Then tighten the bandages that you have wrapped around the patient's feet, around the hole that is towards their head, and the bandages you have wrapped around their thighs, around the turning implement that is towards their feet.
And beside each turning implement, let a helper turn the implement with their hand, and the physician aligns the spinal column as we have described.
And after the spinal column is repositioned and the area is aligned, then it is necessary to apply a dried plaster with egg white, and then a bandage; and then place on the plaster a splint of wood whose width is about three fingers, and whose length is sufficient to cover the area of the deformity, and over the spinal column area.
And then bind it with the bandage we have described, and have the patient use subtle nourishment until healed.
And if any lingering swelling remains in the area at the end of healing, then medicines that soften and cleanse with the table's application, which we have described, must be administered for a long time; and a lead plate is already applied in that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs at the back of the spinal vertebrae, and it is caused by that dislocation; and it is that bone which is swelling, therefore it should not be treated with this medicine, for it will strongly likely cause death.
Chapter 31.
Of the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint should only be dislocated, and what happens to other joints with slight displacement and concavity does not happen to them.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inward, or outward, or forward, or backward.
And it is more commonly dislocated inward, and less so forward or backward.
A sign of a dislocated hip inward is that, when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected leg, the affected leg is longer and the knee is more prominent than on the healthy side, and the patient cannot bend their foot toward the groin.  And the area where it is unable to bend is inflamed with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh bone has now reached there.
The sign of a dislocated hip outward is that the symptoms are opposite to this inward dislocation.
The sign of a dislocated hip forward is that the patient's leg extends to its full length, but cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and struggles to go forward and cannot move it forward; and the patient's urine is retained and the groin is abscessed, and pain is present when walking on the heel.
The sign of a dislocated hip backward is that the knee does not extend, nor can it be bent forward as it is able to bend to the groin, and the patient's leg is shorter than the other, and the groin is swollen, and the head of the thigh bone is toward that area.
However, the reduction of these types of dislocations is that you should consider, then, if the dislocation is old and long-standing, that it has already become ingrained, then you apply reduction and it remains in its position.  Then it's not a complete cure; and therefore, no presumption should be made in that regard.
But in the case of a recent dislocation, and one of the four types of dislocation, then you should attempt to return the joint, extending it inwards and outwards, and moving it to the right and left, for the dislocation will easily return and will not need further treatment.
However, if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant and extend the patient's leg from the lower part, either by using their own hands, or with a bandage tied above the knee; and another assistant should extend the patient's upper hand so that they place their hand below their armpits; and then tighten a strong bandage around the root of the thigh, and a third assistant should hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be either from the inner part to the groin, or from the back to the buttocks.
And let the extension of all of these be done at once until the patient is lifted off the ground by their body weight and remains suspended.
And this type of extension is a common method for all four [types of dislocation].
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then for every type, it is necessary to proceed to the specific cure.
In the specific reduction of a dislocation, when it is dislocated and the dislocation is inward, the patient should be placed on their right side; then apply bandages to the root of the thigh, in the area between the thigh's head and the region below the groin; and then extend the bandage upward from the groin to the highest part of the groin.
And then another strong assistant should take the patient's arms, and forcefully grasp the thick part of the affected thigh and extend it outward by forceful extension, for this will return it to its proper place.
And this type is easier to treat, with which this limb is reduced than the other types.
But if you are hesitant and do not follow the instructions for this type of treatment completely, then the patient's two feet must be bound together with a strong, light bandage, around both ankles and both toes.
And the length of each one should be about four fingers, and the affected leg should be extended more than the other by two fingers.
And then the patient should be suspended upside down from the top of a post, and be in a position of suspension; and the distance from the ground should be about two arm lengths.
And then instruct a strong young man to grasp the top of the thigh, and have another young man suspend the patient, while the first young man, pulling the thigh with strength, will cause the joint to return to its proper place quickly.
However, in the proper reduction, when the dislocation is to the outside, the patient should lie on a support, as we have previously described while having the knee bent; and the bandage should be tight around the affected leg and foot.
And then two posts should be placed, one at the patient's feet and the other at their head; and then posts should be placed fitted in the middle of the hill, covered with damp cloths, so that the patient is not harmed by the posts being between their thighs, so that the extension towards the lower parts is not pulled.
And then each attendant should pull from their side, and the physician with their hand guides the reduction according to the art (or skill).
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then the leg should be slightly extended, and it is in accordance with this same method on a raised surface; and the physician places the palm of their right hand on the affected limb, then with the other hand, they apply pressure, and with that pressure, they extend the lower parts towards the front.
And if the dislocation is in the rear parts, then the patient should not be extended downwards, but elevated above the ground; instead, they should be placed on a hard surface, just as is required for the reduction if their hip is dislocated outwards, in accordance with what we have said regarding their position on two cushions; and they should be on their side, and the ligaments should be extended, as we have previously described, not much.
And pressure should be applied with a compress on the area where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as needed – and the sign of its reduction is clear to you, which is that you extend the patient's legs, and when you see that they are equal and the patient tightens their leg and expands it without excuse, then you know that the limb has been returned correctly – and then you put the legs together and apply a bandage and tighten it so that the hip is not moved in any direction; and keep the patient at rest for three or four days.
And then loosen the bandage and the splint, and compare one leg with the other.
Now, if you see them equal in appearance, then know that the dislocation is now fixed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause of swelling, then you return and bandage it, and tighten it according to your initial tightening, and leave it for three days.
And then loosen it, and have the patient walk on it gradually for a few days, until it is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of a dislocated knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outward, inward, and downwards, as well as backwards; and it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply their leg against their thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration in all these ways is that you should have the patient lie down straight, so that he/she extends their leg as much as possible; place your two hands on the affected side, and place their foot between your feet; then apply your palms to the knee, and hold them firmly between your fingers on the knee; and another attendant should extend the leg until the knee returns to its place.
And a sign of its reduction is that their leg adheres to the thigh with a light, effortless movement.
Then bandage it and apply the leg to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for several days, until they are healed and strengthened.
But if reduction by you is unnecessary, then administer strong extension with ligaments, as described in the account of hip treatments that preceded this.
Chapter 33.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the heel.
The heel is sometimes dislocated by a small movement, and sometimes dislocated according to its completeness, and its dislocation is either inward or outward.
And the sign of its dislocation is that the heel often swells on the side towards which it is dislocated.
But the treatment for a small displacement is a gentle return, and it is that it be pulled easily with the hands and held until it returns to place.
However, in treating a complete dislocation, you must have the patient lie straight, and have a strong and capable assistant on the affected side behind the patient's hips.
And then, you, with your right hand, take hold of the foot's highest point, and with your left hand, take hold of the foot's lowest point, near the ankle.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left hand twice, and then push the foot's lower part with the right hand towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice, as we have counted.
And then push the foot's lower part against the leg a third time, and you're at the ankle.
So, if it returns in one or two attempts using this method, and if you see the foot is now aligned, it's good; and if not, then repeat the procedure on it, for it has returned.
But if you are prevented from reducing it with what we have recounted, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and place a firm, thick piece of cloth on the ground, and have it positioned between the patient's thighs, and you have already draped a cloth over them to prevent injury to the patient.
And then the patient's attendant holds their thighs, and another attendant stretches the leg with their hands or a bandage that ties around the ankle; and each attendant pulls against the other's pull, and the cloth lies between the patient's thighs, holding it in place, so that the patient's body is not pulled apart in the areas below their stretched leg.
And then the physician realigns the dislocation with their hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh in the lower regions, for the dislocation returns with ease.
And so, when the dislocation returns and you are certain of the successful reduction, then apply a plaster and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with bandages.
And be careful or guard against the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage over it is not forceful and damages it severely.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is softened, tighten it.
And then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from movement for 40 days. But if he is forced to walk before that period, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not be re-displaced and corrupted, and consequently not receive a cure.
And if an abscess occurs nearby, then you must apply to that abscess what we previously described, in another location for treatment and fomentation, until it is resolved.
Chapter 34.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the toes of the foot.
The dislocated part should be pulled back gently, without exertion; and this is not difficult, it is rather easy.
But if the dislocation is in one of the joints of the foot, then you must have the patient place their foot on a smooth surface, like the ground or a table, and hold it in the position as if they were walking.
And then you stand, placing your foot on the area of the affected joint. Then press gently on it with your foot until it returns to its proper position, and you see it is now aligned and no longer protruding.
And then place a board beneath the sole of their foot that covers the entire foot, having two ends.  Then secure it firmly and properly for three days.  Afterwards, release it and keep them from walking for many days, until the joint is strengthened and the return to normal function is certain.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocations that are caused by a blow, or by a fracture, or by both together.
When any of these causes occur, and you exert yourself greatly in treating and restoring them, death often results.
Therefore, one should not presume to treat such cases, but only those who are skilled in the art, having long experience, compassionate and patient, cautious, not rash or presumptuous; and who, at the beginning, should use only medicines that soothe inflamed abscesses, and leave the patient to divine judgment, except for those in whom one hopes for a cure from destruction, with alleviation of the illness, and where some hope appears. Then, strive immediately to restore it [the dislocated joint] at the onset of the condition, before it becomes a hot abscess.
And if the limb returns as desired, then administer a regimen that will soothe a hot abscess and treat the injury with appropriate desiccant ointments.
And if the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the bones are separated, then you must treat the fracture, and do in this case what we have said in the simple diseases of what precedes in the treatment of those locations.
And, according to your ability, avoid and escape from the trap of fear in the ways that my instruction has shown you; for this is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more health to your true being in your own time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
