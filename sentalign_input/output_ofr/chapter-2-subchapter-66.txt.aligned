In this type of hernia I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the treatment with an iron instrument.	I have not seen anyone pluck up enough courage to attempt the operative treatment of this kind of rupture.	0.69286984
And the ancients said that it is done like the hernia which is near the face, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after cutting above or lightly below; then cut in the middle, and treat the abscess of the one who operates, until the vessels fall off; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.	The Ancients indeed said it ought to be done in the same way as hernia with varicocele; namely, to ligate the blood-vessels after cutting down upon them, gently, and lower down. Then make an incision in the middle and apply to the tumour such things as will keep it open until the blood-vessels fall away. And dress the wound in the manner we have already mentioned until it heals.	0.82456756
