of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of illnesses, and it is not effective, and you see that the previously mentioned cauterizations with medicine and iron are not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery which is called "cultellare" until it is white;
and thus mark on the painful area a line half a finger long, and remove your hand immediately, and take care not to cut the artery and that you do not reach the bone;
and beware of the mandible that moves when one chews, and be mindful of the nerve that moves it so that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of bleeding from the artery when it is cut, where cutting brings great fear, especially to him who does not know it, and who is not a student and experienced;
and leave the work halfway done;
but I will tell you how to stop the bleeding when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not enough for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades;
and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
