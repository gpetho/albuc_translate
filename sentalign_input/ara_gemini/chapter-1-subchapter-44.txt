Chapter forty-four on cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are due to cold humors flowing to any part of the body
And if the pains occur in the legs, then it is the custom of physicians to call that specifically gout.
So if cold-caused gout is treated with the types of treatment that we mentioned in the classification and the pains do not go away, then cauterization will remove them.
And that is to cauterize it after emptying (purgation) around the joint of the legs with many cauterizations.
And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped and medium-sized in this way:
And if you need to cauterize the face of the man, do it with the cautery iron for spotting.
If the pains rise to the knees or to the other joints, and this often happens, cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery iron.
If you need more than this cauterization, cauterize him, but do not deepen your hand with the cautery, but let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If the pains rise to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned of cauterization in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, cauterize around the two forearms as you go around two rows.
If the pains remain in the fingers, cauterize them on each knuckle a spot and on the back of the hand.
If the pains rise after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize them on each side.
And the sick person should not be without good management and taking medications, for if he improves his diet and vomits the phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
