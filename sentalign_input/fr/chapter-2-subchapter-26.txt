When the nose is cut and sewn
Know that when a separation occurs in one of these cartilaginous operations, it is of little benefit, except in some men. So, when this happens to someone, look to see if the wound is fresh with its blood; then join the two lips with a suture, and treat it until it is healed; and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, then you must scrape all the parts of their flesh until they bleed, then join the two lips with a suture, and compress it, and sprinkle with dragon's blood powder and ground incense; and place on the powders a piece of strong plaster or another binding plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of the suture is that you join the separation: either with needles, as we have said in the suturing of the belly; or with thread, as I have made known to you.
