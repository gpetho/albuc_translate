On the cutting of the binding which occurs under the tongue and inhibits speech.
This binding that occurs under the tongue sometimes is natural, present at birth, or accidental and occurs due to a wound that has healed.
And the procedure for it is that you open the patientâ€™s mouth, their head resting in your lap; and lift their tongue, and then you cut that nerve binding according to the width needed to free the tongue from its restriction.
But if there is any hardness or thickening in it, and this is due to the consolidation of a wound, then you take a hook and cut it by the width necessary until you have cut the binding and the thickening is dissolved.
And be careful not to make a fissure in the fleshy part and that you cut here gradually so that a flow of blood does not occur.
And then the incision site should be washed with rose water or vinegar or cold water; and then place under the tongue licini; this is a piece of linen that the patient keeps under their tongue each night so that it does not consolidate again.
But if a flow of blood occurs, place crushed vitriol on the site; but if the blood continues, then cauterize the site with an appropriate cautery iron.
And then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
