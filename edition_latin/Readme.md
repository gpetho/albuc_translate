The XML contains one incorrectly identified chapter in book 1 and two in book 2, these were manually removed.

Opening and closing tags of div elements within some chapters were removed.

Removed ocr tags manually, kept the `<good>` elements

Throughout the book the capitalisation at the beginning of sentences was inconsistent, with either periods being followed by lower-case letters or commas being followed by upper case for no particular reason. These were corrected manually to ensure that they would not interfere with sentence segmentation.

Two figure captions that were identified as separate paragraphs and interrupted paragraphs (in both cases, they appeared between the two halves of a hyphenated word) were deleted. These captions do not appear in the Arabic anyway and are not an integral part of the text.

Numbers were marked incorrectly, the period preceding the number being adjoined to the preceding word like this: *ex. XX. palmis*. These were manually corrected to this: *ex .XX. palmis*.
