Chapter Twenty-One.
On Cauterizing Toothache.
If the toothache is caused by cold, or if there are worms in it, and the treatment with medications is not effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fat or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fat is as follows: You take cow's fat and boil it in an iron ladle or in a shell. Then you take cotton and wrap it on the end of a probe, then dip it in the boiling fat and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools.
Then you repeat it several times until the strength of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. And if you wish, you can dip wool or cotton in cold fat and place it on the aching tooth, and place the heated iron on top of it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
Cauterization with fire is as follows: You use a copper or iron tube, somewhat thick so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.  Then, heat the cautery iron which appears in the illustration and place it on the tooth itself, and hold your hand steady until the cautery iron cools. Do this several times.
The pain will go away either that same day or the next.  Following the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good quality fat, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out.  This is an image of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you want and according to what is possible. This is a picture of the tube.
