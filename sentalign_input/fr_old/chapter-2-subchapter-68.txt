on the softening of the skin of the testicles
Sometimes the skin of the testicles in some men becomes softened because the flesh inside is softened, and it is unsightly to see. When treating this, it is necessary to make the patient lie on his back and cut the softened skin on the natural skin; then join the two lips with a stitch. If you want, first sew the excess softened skin with three or four firm stitches; then cut between the stitches and treat it like other wounds until it is healed, and the stitches fall out.
