After I have completed for you, children, this book, which is the last of the science in medicine with its completion, and have reached its end in its expositions and its declarations, it has seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise, which is a part of operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Since the operation with the hand has been laid low in our region and in our time utterly private—until perhaps its science has perished, and its trace has been cut off—and there remain from it only small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been altered by hands, and error and hesitation have befallen them, until its intentions have been closed, and its sight has been withdrawn—it has seemed to me to revive it with the ordering of this treatise in it, according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation, and to come with forms of cautery instruments and the other instruments of the work, with the addition of declaration and with the hastening of that which is necessary.
The cause however for which a good craftsman of it is not found with his hand in this our time is: that the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen narrated, until he knows the aids to the limbs, and their forms, and their connection and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their exits, and of the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their exits.
And because of that Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with a work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We however have already said about that in the introduction of this book.
Since he who is not knowledgeable about what we have said regarding anatomy is not deterred from falling into error, whereby people are killed, just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science and boast about it without knowledge and without experience.
That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut an abscess in the neck of a woman, and cut some arteries in the neck, wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man who had advanced in age, and the stone was large.
So he reached it and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Therefore the man died on the third day.
And indeed I had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the disposition of the sick man, that he would die.
And I saw another physician who was receiving a stipend from a certain Duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician, with his ignorance, hurried and bound the fracture over the wound with pillows and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound any breathing space.
Then he dismissed him according to his own desires.
Afterwards, he dismissed him after a few days, and instructed him not to loosen the bandage: and he stood like that until his leg and his foot were festered, and he arrived at death.
Therefore, I was called to him: and I hurried to loosen the bandage: and tranquility followed, and he escaped from his pains.
However, the corruption had already become confirmed in the limb: and I was unable to restrain it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to wander in the limb until he died.
And I saw another physician, who pierced the cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated after days, until its malice increased with its master.
That is because when the cancer is pure, from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate its being completely severed.
And therefore, children, it is necessary for you to know that surgery, with the hand, is divided into two divisions: namely, surgery to which health is joined; and surgery with which there is danger in many dispositions. And I have already roused in every place of this book, in which comes the surgery, in which is terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of it, and to diminish it, so that fools may not find a way to speak ill of and dishonor it.
Therefore, take the measure with diligence and protection, and your sick with ease and firmness, and use the better path leading through God's grace to health and praiseworthy success; and leave the terrible illnesses of difficult cure; and remove your souls from that which causes you fear, so that hesitation may not enter into your faith and your advantage. For there remains more for your glory, and higher things in this world, and finally for your possessions.
For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad physician.

Part I.
Concerning the benefit and harm of the cautery; and with which complexions it is suitable, and at what time; and if with iron, or gold.
Chapter 1.
But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary for me to speak of the quality of its benefits and harms, and in what complexion it should be applied.
I say, therefore, that the discussion of the quality of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a matter of knowledge and hidden secrets.
Many wise men have spoken on it, and disagreed; and for me, a little from their words is enough, fearing length.
I say, therefore, that cautery benefits every complexion, with or without matter, except for two complexions: a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
However, they disagreed about the hot and dry complexion with matter.
For some said that cautery is helpful in it.
And others said the opposite, namely that cautery is not suitable in an illness caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat; and it is unsuitable that one be healed from a hot and dry illness by heat and dryness.
And he who says the opposite stated that through cautery, help is given in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare a human body and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I indeed say through his statement: because experience has already shown me that on several occasions.
However, it is not appropriate for one to come upon it unless one has already been proven and trained in the final exercise of the cautery chapter, and has known the diversity of human complexions and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their duration of time.
From the other complexions, however, there is no fear for you; and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For now all physicians have agreed upon them, and have not disagreed in their use of cautery in them.
And know, children, that from the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach except the member that is cauterized, and does not harm another member joined to it, except with small harm.
However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distanced from the members, and perhaps causes illness of difficult healing in a member, and perhaps kills it.
But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.
Now, however, that has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and our station upon the truth of things; and for that reason I excuse myself from the length of the discourse.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time in which the cautery should be applied, and prefer the time of spring.
And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times, because the harm that is incidental to the time is submerged in the benefit that is attracted by the cautery.
And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate slowness; because it is feared that from them greater harm will result than the slight harm caused by delay.
And do not let it enter your minds, O children, that which only the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely, that the illness cured by cautery does not always return; and they consider that a consequence, and the matter is not as they suppose: because cautery is not unless in the place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries the humidities which are the cause why pains occur.
However, cautery surpasses medicine in the swiftness of its cure, and the power of its action, and the vehemence of its dominion; and it is possible for the illness to return at some time according to the patient's complexion, and the location of his illness, and its power; and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it; and what comes to him in its acquisition from foods and similar causes, unless it be an illness in which cautery is administered. A subtle illness in a limb from few superfluities and humidities, such as toothache, and similar to it, for pain; it is possible that that pain will not return in it.
But that happens in few cases.
But truly the common people's assertion that cautery is the last resort of medicine is correct; not for what they intend by that, since they believe that there is no cure that compares with medicine, nor any after the cautery has passed.
However, the matter is the opposite of that, and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is not, except that when we administer methods of treatment for some illness, and those medicines do not work; then we administer cautery at the end of things, and it works: then from there it falls, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention understood by the common people and many unskilled physicians.
However, the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say that except because of the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance; and they said that the place of the cautery does not produce pus. But that is not absolutely so; since I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, just as they said.
However, when you make a cautery of fire from gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the quantity you desire, because of the redness of the gold; and when it rapidly approaches the cold, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Therefore, the craftsman falls from that occupation; and because of that, cautery with iron is quicker and more effective with us, by reason of its suitability for the operation.
And I indeed have already arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters; and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that they may alleviate the seeker of what they wish from it. Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization is beneficial in controlling the excess of moisture and coldness in the brain; these two are causes of headaches, and of the flow of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of excessive sleep, and toothache, and sore throat; and universally, every sickness that arises from cold, such as paralysis, headaches, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is, that you should first prescribe to the sick person a cleansing, resolving medicine for the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his habit.
Then command him to shave his head with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands in a square posture, so that he has placed his hands upon his chest.
Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever therefore your middle finger arrives, mark that place with the cautery. Then apply the olive-shaped cautery to the fire. Then place him upon the place marked with the cautery, descending, so that your hand is gradually constrained, and you revolve him.
Then quickly lift your hand, and observe the place.
If you see now exposed from the bone a quantity of alkali or a quantity of zeuherb, then raise your hand.
And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from it if it cools down: until the bones, which I told you, appear.
Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak in it cotton, and place it on the place, and leave it for three days.
Then place on top of the cotton soaked in butter, and leave it on the place, until the scab of fire is destroyed. Then treat it with the four-drug ointment, until it is healed.
They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more it emits pus: therefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Then scrape away that which has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the ultimate with the cautery, until it makes an impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, which is done like the shape of a kirate; or the instrument that women use in pouring small alphabetic ink.  And they believe that vapors from the head are driven out from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it is consolidated.
However, these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be at all appropriate except in some men according to the way of fear.
And to leave it [the wound] is, in my opinion, better with regard to his health.
For the head is weakened by the breaking of its natural continuity, as we have testified in the other members; and especially when the head of the weak person is naturally feeble.  And indeed the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore operate with it in health.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Chapter 3.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head, and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses leeches, and cupping, and head-purges, and oils, and emollients.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with the one cautery that we have described, and if none of those [treatments] helps him, then consider.
For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and not weak, and it finds a vehement cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly under the [previous] one.
Then cauterize it above every horn of its head with a cautery, so that it does not pierce the skin, and a quantity of bone, as we have described, is uncovered.
And cauterize it with a single cautery on the occiput of its head, in the place called *vas* (or vessel): and it is the place where a cupping is placed.  And elevate your cautery in this, and do not uncover bone.
For the sick person finds, because of that, a vehement pain, and different from the pain of the other cauteries of all the head.
And I say that this cautery should be in its place: and it should be a cautery with which the horns of the head and its occiput are cauterized, a finer cautery than the one used for cauterizing the middle of the head.
And this is its form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a hemicrania, both with a cauterizing medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed with purifying medicines, and the remaining treatment, which I described in the divisions of illnesses, is administered, and it does not benefit the whole: then cauterization is performed in it according to two methods: either cauterization with a burning, sharp medicine, or with iron. The cauterium with a burning, sharp medicine is to take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Then dissect the painful area at the time with a broad phlebotom, until a space under the skin is made in which the clove is placed.
Then insert it into the space beneath the skin until it is hidden; then bind over it with a suitable constricting bandage, and leave it for a quantity of fifteen hours, then loosen it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days. Afterward, apply to it a poultice soaked in butter until the area produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I wrote in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
The cauterization of it with iron, however, is according to this method.
The cautery iron, whose form is this.
And it is called a nail, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is something of a curve, and in its middle there is a small eminence.
Then place it upon the place, and hold your hand; and you shall turn the iron gradually with speed; and the quantity that is burned shall be from the thickness of the skin, like half of it.
And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak a cloth in salt water, and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; then place a cloth with butter; afterward treat with ointment until it is healed. And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife-edge.
And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not an old one properly.
Concerning the method of cauterizing an old hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When treating hemicrania, with what we have said from the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and if the treatment does not help; and you see from the disease that what we have said about the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient, then it is necessary to heat the cautery knife until it turns white after you have marked the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that; and place your hand on one side, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone. However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves during mastication, lest the side or nerve that moves it be burned, whence spasm may result.
And be on guard, and cautious of the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut.
For in its cutting lies danger, and especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not diligent or skilled; and he abandons the operation with it at the outset.
And I will come with a reminder of the regimen for the blood flow occurring from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
If you see from the sickness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with the cautery having two knives.
For this cauterization is better and more beneficial. Concerning the method of cauterization in earache.
Chapter VI. When earache occurs from cold, and is treated with remedies, and the rest of the treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then apply a cautery: and it is that which is called the Point, whose form is this.
Then, after its ignition, points with it around the entire ear, as it revolves; or around each, if the pain is in both at the same time.
And move the cautery slightly away from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with ink: and let the quantity of cautery be ten points in each ear, and like that.
Then treat the places until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Torture.
Chapter VII.
Torture that is cured with cauterization is only from the types that arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses. And avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of torture with leeches, and head-cleansings, and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize the afflicted with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second slightly lower on its temporal area, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the afflicted part.
Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the tip of the upper part of the ear, below the horn of the head, slightly; and another on the temporal region, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type from the knife, whose form was previously mentioned; however, it is not much thinner than that, as you see; and it ought to be a knife with a little superfluous thickness. Then treat the places with that which preceded, until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in ancient Apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When the apoplexy is longstanding, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment is of no benefit, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries upon each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and with a cautery in the back of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of the cautery should be according to what preceded.
Also, cauterize with a cautery on the opening of the stomach; and this is more of a last resort.
Then, treat him with what preceded.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Forgetfulness.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that large doses of hyerae and pills that cleanse the brain be given to the sick person first.
Then shave the sick person's whole head, and place on his occiput a plaster of synapis as described in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times. For this is the method of the cautery; and do it according to the same order as I have said there. If, therefore, it heals by that, it is good.
If not, then make three cauteries on the posterior part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye; and place the thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Then treat the cautery, with what went before.
If however you wish an addition, and the sick person is tolerant of it, then make a cautery in the middle.
If you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form which was given previously.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in cleansing the head with hyssop, and with what we have said.
Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery above each horn of the head, and with a cautery above its back, and with three above the vertebrae of the neck.
If, however, in the sickness there is a need for softening the body with more than those, and the sick person is tolerant, and the illness is severe: then cauterize him with four cauteries above the vertebrae of the back, and lastly with a cautery, until most of his skin is burned, and raise your hand.
Then treat him until he is healed: and thus the cautery is Olive.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that one whose epilepsy is from phlegm. Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the other treatment that we have described in the division, when the patient is strong, or is tolerant in taking medicines.
However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and chewing motions that cleanse the brain are administered, many days beforehand with improvement in the diet.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner: and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery over every horn of his head.
If however, the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned in the case of paralysis, and for the softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method which preceded. If however the patient is a child, then apply a thin cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Melancholy.
Chapter XII.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we mentioned in the case of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of downward melancholic influence, and the patient's body is moist, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what has been previously described in the division: then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a neatly fashioned pad of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head, and the patient, seated upright, must be held in place on all sides.
Then apply the liniment. And it is better made from old sheep's butter.
And heat it over a fire with a moderate amount of heat, such that a finger can tolerate it when placed inside.
Then apply it to the center of his head in a circular motion, and let it remain until it cools.
Do this for the sick person once every week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures throughout it, so that you hold the cautery, indeed, while smelling it.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place over it a poultice soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs, which I have stated in the division, then begin and let the weak drink it, with that which will cleanse his head.
And guard him from all moisture, and make him sit in a bath, in fasting for a few days.
Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him over both temples with two cauteries, if the descent of water is in both eyes simultaneously; or from one side, if the descent of water is in one eye; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin; and let the cauteries be long in the width of the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see anything from it, then cut it away immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and caution against the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries finally applied.
Concerning the method of cauterization in ancient lachrymal cases.
Chapter XIV.
When the tears of the eyes are old, persistent, and are above the veins and arteries that are on the exterior head, it is ascertained that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities, then cauterize with the same cautery as I have described in the beginning of descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck under the two bones.
And if it needs further application, then cauterize it on every side of the eye cautiously, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing for a foul smell from the nose.
Chapter XV.
When you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, then act quickly and give the weak decoctions in a drink for three nights; afterwards shave his head and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive cautery.
Then cauterize it with a claw cautery, using two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
And guard against the artery, lest you strike it.
And this is the form of the Claw cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on every side: and they should be spaced apart by two times their width: and the length of each cautery should be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not bring your hand with the cautery to the furthest point, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of lunar cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are inverted and prick the eye. Chapter XVII.
The cautery is of two types: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with a burning medicine.
In the cautery with fire, first instruct the patient to remove his hairs, if he is one who trims them, until they are extended and equal. If, however, they prick him at their origin, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow out.
When they have grown out and are equal, then place the patient's head in your lap; then mark upon the eyelid of his eyes with ink, a mark in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over the eye.
Then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Then cauterize over the shape that you marked, gradually in many stages, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned away.
And the sign of the success of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting, and the hairs rising near the puncture of the eye.
Therefore, lift your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Then place over it a poultice with butter, until the eschar is removed.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
If any of the hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid softens, then cauterize that place again, as you did at first.
If however the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural position and made even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
It is that you command the infirm person to let the hairs grow until they are extended and even.
Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper on cloth.
Then take from known soap and from unleached lime each a weight of one ounce or nearly that: then rub them together with good trituration, and do it quickly, lest it become cold.
Then take from the paste that you made from it over the paper that you made as the form of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or of two.
And place under the eye a poultice soaked in egg white: and let the head of the infirm person be in your bosom.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it a little.
And you shall move it whenever the infirm person feels the biting of the medicine: because its biting is found as fire.
While therefore that which he finds as biting persists, then leave the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid rise, as it rises upon contraction with fire, or with incision, it is well; and if not, then again place upon it of the medicine upon the place where the medicine does not imprint, and does not darken, until your operation is equalized, and the eye contracts.
Then place upon it Cotum with butter, until the skin of the burn is eradicated.
Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you in the operation, that you guard the ultimate guard, lest anything of the medicine fall into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after days, and something fights out of the hairs into the eye, then again place medicine upon that place which softens from the eyelid properly, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and smallness.
Therefore, according to that let your consideration be: and the path of righteousness is not hidden from him who has a study of this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a tear duct fistula.
Chapter XIX.
When you treat a fistula, in the same way as we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then you ought to cauterize it according to this method.
Tell the sick person to place their head in your lap, and let the attendant hold their head between their hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with their head.
Then place a cautery, steeped in egg white or in psyllium mucilage, on their eye.  Then, apply the cautery, the shape of which is like this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to penetrate right to the other end, and if you wish it to be held so upwardly.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then place the cautery, made very hot, upon it.
And hold your hand with the cautery near the eye, toward the nose, so that your hand does not wander or the sick person be disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If therefore you reach the beginning of your cautery up to the bone, it will be well.
And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Then place a bandage with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it is healed. If forty days have passed and it is not healed, then place a sharp corrosive medicine on it, until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what is in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first [practitioners] said.
Attend to the location of the fistula, and split it; then place in the fissure a fine camahan, that is, a fine cannula, whose form is this.
And pour into it a drachm of melted lead, and hold your hand with the cannula firmly, and let the sick person not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the sick person's eye a poultice soaked in egg white, or in water.
For lead burns the area of the fistula and heals it with a remarkable cure.
If the fistula is healed by what we have said of cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal passage, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will come to its proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterization in lip fissures.
Chapter 20.
Often fissures occur in the lip, which are called hairs, and especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, as we have said in the division of diseases, and treatment is not effective, then use a small knife cautery with fire, according to this form.
And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then treat it with a cautery, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a fistula of the mouth.
Chapter XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth; then it forms pus and bursts; afterward it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and treatment does not help it, then it is necessary to cauterize the fistula with a cautery according to its size.
Then insert the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its depth and end, do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterwards with what we have said about treatment until it is healed.
If therefore the pus is cut off and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the corrupted bone according to what is in its head.
Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum softens because of moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with remedies, and it does not help: then place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Then, with fire, a cautery, whose shape will come after these things, so that you place the cannula on the tooth: and quickly insert the heated cautery into it: and hold your hand for a short time, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire having already reached the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to your will.
Then let the sick person fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and let him spit it out.
For the moved tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Chapter XXIII.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or worm within, and treatment with medicines does not help: then a cautery should be applied to it in two ways: either a cautery with butter, or a cautery with fire.
Its cautery with butter is that you should take fresh butter and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a vessel.
Then take a wick, and wrap it around the end of the probe.
Then immerse it in the boiled butter, and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat it several times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or a wick in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place heated iron upon it until fire reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Its cauterization with fire is to hold a bronze or iron cannula. And let there be something of its thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the infirm person's bone.
Then, take a cautery whose shape will come, and place it upon that tooth, and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do it several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or on another.
And it is necessary, in the impression of that cautery, that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for one hour, then spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever extremity you are able, and this is the shape of the Cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Strophuls.
Chapter Twenty-four.
When strophuls are caused by phlegm and cold humors, and are not amenable to digestion by medicines, and their digestion is required swiftly, then use a concave cautery, whose shape is this.
Having two open extremities, so that smoke may escape from the cautery through the other extremity; and place it, ignited, upon the abscess once, and a second time, if it needs it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice infused in butter, until that which the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with a tooth ointment, until the shape of the cannula is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
Chapter XXV.
When humidities overcome the bronchial tube, and especially when it is with a cold complexion, then it is necessary that the weak person be evacuated first with loosening medicines.
Then cauterize it in the nocrati at the root of the throat in a depressed place; and beware, lest you reach with the cautery to the throat, nor to the skin, unless something of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck in the last vertebra of it, finishing it; and let the cautery be narrow according to the manner that preceded.
Then treat it with what preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in diseases of the lungs and cough.
Chapter XXVI.
When cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the illness is long-standing, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in low, smooth, empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be of a tube shape according to the form that preceded.
And if your desire is cauterization by puncturing with a cautery, which is called "Punctum," whose form preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures, up as though to others.
Then treat him with that which preceded, until he is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Therefore, cauterization will be alleviated when you do it with three cauteries at one time.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the Titillico, in the dislocation of the Humerus.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and does not fix itself at the time of its return from dislocation, until it is accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a small movement which happens as we have already testified, then you should reduce the dislocation first.
Then the patient should be laid on their back, or on their healthy side.
Then raise the skin that is in the inner Titillico upwards with the fingers of your left hand, and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then take a cautery iron with two prongs. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
And sometimes cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, why then the figure of the cauterization is of six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the fineness of the thread.
And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added to this manner, why there are eight cauteries.
Then place crushed leeks with salt upon the cautery.
Then make the weak person adhere to tranquility, so that the limb does not move at any time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upwards, and rarely does that happen, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the sick person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach, until they draw it out of its complexion, and phlegm multiplies upon it, and assiduous methods of treatment do not help: then it is necessary that the sick person be laid on his back, and extend his legs and hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery beneath the spoon of the chest the size of one finger with a clauili cautery, and two cauteries below on either side of a single cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
And lengthen between each so they do not join, when they will make pus. And the depth of the cautery be the amount of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery which makes this cautery be one according to the form of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by pricking him who is terrified by this cautery: and it is, that you mark upon the stomach a point according to the quantity, which you wish with encaustic: then cauterize it with a cautery of the point: then care for it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
Of the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter XXIX.
When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and moisture, or from thick wind, until it departs from its natural complexion by an excess discharge, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the sick person be placed on his neck, and mark with encaustic three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity over the lower liver below the hypochondria, where the man's elbow reaches: and let the space that is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body straight: and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
And let the quantity of that which is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, a quantity of half of it, not added: and let the sick person stand on his feet.
If however he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms. This is the form of the cautery.
And it is possible for you, indeed, to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when there is subtlety and prudence in your art.
And guard yourself so that you do not proceed too quickly in the cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, for then the entire body is burned, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know this.
Concerning the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Chapter XXX.
When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if the abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person is afflicted with pain, and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is intense sharpness with the pain; and you see already that the treatment has wearied its physicians.
Therefore, the sick person should lie on their back.
Then mark the location of the abscess with ink; then apply a cautery that resembles a ray.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with it one cautery, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for exits, until it is healed.
And it is not fitting for one to use this type of cautery unless their study in the medical art is prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have run their course with experience many times; then indeed may they dare to perform this sort of operation.
But truly, to abandon it is better for me.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Pleuritis.
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said that cautery with aristolochia roots is for a cold pleurisy according to this method.
And it is that you should take from dry, long aristolochia roots, one root longer than the rest, and it should be the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil, and light it in fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery at the junction of the fork with the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly sloping downward to the area under the beard.
And with two cauteries also at the area between the fifth and sixth ribs sloping slightly backward; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And with three cauteries from behind: one at the area between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
And you should not press your hand with the cautery, rather it should be visible, smelling the skin. And some ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a rod; and they heat it and insert it into the area between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and pus comes out; just as we said in the case of a liver abscess.
But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the weak man dies immediately or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no cure.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the spleen, Chapter XXXII.
When you treat the illness of the spleen, according to what we have said about treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then a cautery should be used in it in three ways, all of which are correct.
One of which is to make three or four cauteries, drawing lines along the length of the spleen, in the shape of the liver cauteries, whose figure preceded this.
And let there be between each cautery a distance equal to the thickness of a finger, or a little more or less.
And let the method of the cautery be the same as that which we described for the cautery of the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the sick person lie weak on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: to apply a cautery with two prongs, as we stated in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus; and lift the skin, which is directly over the spleen, where the sick person's left elbow reaches; and let your lifting of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then insert two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them; then withdraw the cautery; thus four cauteries are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then treat the cautery after you let it emit pus for many days; for it is more beneficial than all the previous treatments.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Chapter XXXIII.
The cautery does not fall upon dropsy unless properly applied.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment that we have described in the division, and the treatment does not work, then you should cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery above the stomach, and another cautery above the liver, and a cautery above the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and the depth of the cautery should be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it emits pus for a long time.
And do not remove the sick person from treatment after the cautery with him; because it is necessary that two intentions be gathered in him: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, according to its previous form; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previous form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs. Chapter Thirty-Four.
When abscesses develop in a hydrops patient, and they are filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize above the back of the foot, in the area between the auricular and annular bones.  Lift your hand with the cautery, and do not rotate it; then lift your hand, and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellow water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the blade end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg; and above each thigh, make two cauteries.  And leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may sweat out from it; then treat it with the other things which we have said.
Concerning the method of cauterization in abdominal distension. Chapter XXXV.
When abdominal distension is caused by cold and moisture, weakening the retentive and digestive powers of the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with methods of cure, but does not heal; and you see a weak patient tolerating a cautery of exuberant power, then cauterize him with a large cautery upon his stomach, according to what preceded in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery, and with four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle nail-shaped cautery; and with a large cautery above the kidneys, or with two cauteries.
And if you see excessive moisture, and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the breastbone, and with a cautery on each hip; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For this is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted moisture, and are treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries above the lower spine of the back under the almeidati a little triangularly, and with a cautery under the navel by about two fingers' breadth.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming suppurated, then cauterize him above the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and with a cautery above his liver, and another on his spleen, with a clauili cautery: and leave the cautery open for a time: then treat him until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you excise althelul, then cauterize with a cautery that resembles a ray.
Then introduce the burning cautery into the excised althelul: and with the last of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein through which blood flows: do this once, or twice. If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have described.
Then treat them, with that which is beneficial to them from ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more effective in helping.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter XXXVIII.
When the sick person does not respond to the incision and operation that we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is cured with a cautery.
Therefore, when a fistula occurs in someone, and it becomes chronic, pus flows from it, and corrupted humors.
Therefore, it is more fitting that you probe it with a thin probe.
Then ascertain its depth with the probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is like a ray.
Then insert yourself the ignited cautery into the fistula, and the quantity in which the cautery entered. And repeat the cautery on it, until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your need.
And beware of burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula goes to the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then beware of all these places.
And do not do this, unless the fistula is in a fleshy place, and you think it is not penetrating.
Then treat the place until it is healed.
If however the place is sealed, and the matter is cut away from it, and it remains thus for a long time, then know that it is now completely healed.
And if matter is not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupt opening is within it, or something like that from those, the remembrance of which will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from a thick wind, and it lessens because of that of the sick person, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the almethen upon the kidneys themselves, with a cautery on every kidney with a cautery-clavil, the remembrance of which has preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the almeidate itself.
Therefore, three lines will come.
Therefore, the last will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Chapter XL. When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, to the point where the sick person cannot retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic hair begin, and cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the summit and another from the left side of it; and let the length of this cauterization on each side be according to the width of a thumb's knot; and cauterize it with a cautery on the lower back, or with two cauteries, if that is necessary; and let this be according to the previous cautery's pattern.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb. Chapter XLI.
When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and it is prevented from conception, and her menses are corrupted, and their expulsion is delayed, and pain occurs to her upon their arrival, then it is necessary that she be cauterized with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above, slightly below the back, or with two cauteries; and let the cautery be as before.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Chapter XLII.
When mucous humors discharge into the anus, and cause its expulsion from its place; and a sign of this is that one leg is prolonged over the other when compared together; and the place of the dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore, it is necessary that you cauterize the affected area above the anus itself with a similar circular cautery; after you mark it with ink in a circle around the anus as it revolves; and that the anus itself falls in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the form that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
If this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive cautery; and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica. Chapter XLIII.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and dampness; and the patient is treated with what we have stated in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it grows worse: then it is necessary to free the patient from thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Then cauterize it.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two ways: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
Cautery with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is that you cauterize over the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them a good or bad depth.
And let the space between each cautery be the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes, however, a cautery is made in the middle above the head of the hip itself.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the hip dislocation, one: so that the circle contains the whole hip.
And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cautery for Sciatica, when the pain adheres to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
However, if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, over the place where the sufferer points there, where the pain is, and with your cautery on the shin four fingers to the wild side for a little while: and let the cautery be a knife-like one. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
If the sufferer indicates that the pain extends to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a point cautery, three, or four, or more if it needs it.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-like cautery.
And beware in all your cauterizations, lest you overdo it with the cautery so as to burn the nerve, or a large artery, and thus bring upon the sufferer ill harm, or contraction.
And truly I have already seen one and another, from those who have cauterized above the ankle and have overdone it in the cauterization, and the leg has swollen until the swelling reached the foot, and it was entirely perforated and the whole foot was corrupted: then there happened a loosening of the abdomen, and death afterwards.
If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this method.
And certain learned men said in the cauterization of the anca, of which this is the method of cautery.
Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter be half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date stone, or a little less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space that is between every cautery be the quantity of a thumb's knot: and let the cauteries be open on both sides: and let their height be like a knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron fitting well into the cauteries.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in fire, until it turns red and throws off sparks: then let it be placed over the affected area of the anca, the sick person lying on their healthy side.
Therefore cauterize it with three round cauteries at one time.
Then leave it for three days.
Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says, with this kind of cautery, O children, we have used it little, because of the terror of its appearance, and because we have found few who will wait upon it.
However, it is a good cautery for him who endures it, and finds a place for it with him.
A cautery, however, is with burning medicines, so that you make two pieces of samian ware having a perforated armilla, into which descends a hinge of its gate, of bronze, or iron, the length of a wall: whose height should be two knots, or like themselves.
And let the space between both be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let that which contains them be joined together, according to this form.
Then place it upon a box of ashes, the sick person lying on their healthy side.
And press your hand firmly upon the box of ashes.
Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been warmed with fire for a short time, and hold it for the amount of an hour: and let the sick person tolerate its burning, and its cauterization, for he finds the burning like fire, until the burning ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe the entire ash with sweet water; then leave it for three days.
And place butter upon it, until the blackness of the cauterization is removed; and leave it for a few days, and pus will run from it.
For it is the last in healing.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a poultice on it containing water, in the same manner as you did for the ash.
And this is the method of warm water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Take alkali and quicklime, each one part: grind both, and put them in a new pot, whose bottom is pierced with a small hole, according to the amount that the radius will enter it: and place another glass pot beneath the bottom of the pot: and pour over the alkali and lime fresh water, so that both are submerged by a finger's breadth: after that, press them with your hand with a good pressure; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over other lime; and strain it until it is renewed.
For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is used in many surgical operations and in cauterizing other limbs.
Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
And among medicines with which the anca is cauterized, also like tesisie, and honey of anacard, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen, indeed, narrating, recounted the cure of a certain man from ancient times, by which the pain of the anca and sciatic vein was cured; and he praised it as being very great.
And he said, because he did not require any further treatment, and because he was healed in one instance, until he recounted that perhaps he entered a bath carried, and emerged from it already healed. And it is to be taken from green seitaragi; and if green is not found, let dry, fresh, be taken; and it shall be ground much with a little fat, and placed upon the anca, where the pain is, or the leg, or in the thigh; and it shall be bound, and left for a quantity of three hours, or for the quantity that the infirm person feels sedation of the burning.
Then immerse him in a bath.
When therefore his body becomes moist, immerse him in a chair.
For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
And know that no one should use a cautery with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides, who also said that the dung of goats, when cauterized with it the sciatic vein, benefits it: and the cautery is performed in this manner.
Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it upon the deep place that is between the big toe and the sole, and is closer to the sole.
Then take the dry dung of goats, and burn it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it upon the wool, and let it be, until it is extinguished.
Then do it again.
Therefore do not cease to do it, until the sensation above the mediation reaches the ankle, and the pain rests.
And this method of cautery is called cautery of the Vaccinum.
Concerning the cauterization of pain in the back.
Chapter XLIV.
Sometimes pain in the back occurs from many causes, either from an accident, or from a blow, or from the evacuation of superfluous matter, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter: and cautery indeed does not fall, except in this single type, which is made from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after the evacuation of the patient with foul pills, and similar things, they should be placed on the back, where the pain is, three lines according to the width of the almeidati itself, after marking with ink in each line five cauteries, or more according to the amount that comes from the tolerance of the patient's strength: and let cauterization be done with a cautery-point.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a medial clauile cautery, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the beginning stages of a humpback.
Chapter XLV.
This illness often occurs in young children.
And the sign of its beginning in children is: that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you find at the last of the spinal vertebrae of the back and its nodules, that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cauterium that is a circle of this shape.
And let the cauterium encompass the entire part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize in a circle of the vertebra with a pointed cauterium, make two or three lines; and let the points be close together.
Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware, lest you apply the cauterium to the hump which results from a spasm of the nerve.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in gout and pains of the joints. Chapter XLVI.
When pains in the joints are from cold humours that flow to any part of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call it gout properly.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then the cauterium removes them.
And it is that you cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Whose this is the form.
And if you need to pierce on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and that often happens, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries from every side, with this same claw-shaped cautery. If however more of this cautery are necessary for you, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If however the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said about the cautery in its chapter.
If however the pains are only in the hands, then puncture the points in the circumference of the foci, as if two lines revolve.
If however pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, above each knot, and above the ridge of the hand.
If however the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not remove the sick person from a good regimen, from the reception of medicines.
For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Ruptures.
Chapter XLVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine, or the spermatic cord, descends towards the testicle, and it is in the beginning close by: then it is necessary that you command the sick person to give up eating on his own day.
And let him use of the lenitives, so that the excrement descends from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands upon his back; and command him to hold his breath, until it emerges, or the spermatic cord, or the intestine appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture above the pubic bone, with a sign whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Then with a cautery of this form, until it comes white and throws off sparks.
Then reduce the intestine, or spermatic cord, to its concavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand over the spot, so that the intestine does not come out; and you have now opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another servant over his legs, and another over his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery upon that mark, with your hand holding the cautery upright.
And hold it until you meet with its mouth; or again with it a second time, if you have not met with its mouth in the first.
And carefully observe for the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn it, and that death or great harm befall the sick person through it.
And know that when you do not meet with the mouth with the cautery, your operation is of no use.
And the cautery should be small for children, according to their size.
Then treat with the remaining ointments until it is healed.
And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary to give him nourishment for the duration of his treatment, to soften his stomach, so that his intestines do not protrude during straining and bowel movements.
Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage and let him keep it for another forty days.
For when he follows this regimen, he is thus completely healed.
When ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen, and are incipient, and there is a need to prevent them from worsening, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let the part that is cauterized be thus about a third of its size.
Then treat him with what we said, and it will not worsen.
And some early authorities have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed that is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line to the lower side. And place your hand in the middle with the cautery iron.
But the first cautery is easier and better. Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to a fall or blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When in some limbs pain from a fall or blow occurs, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of each limb be a cautery according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twist, and the pain from it.
If therefore it is healed from the first cautery, it is well.
If not, then repeat the cautery upon it.
Because it is customary for these pains to shift from the limb to that which is near it.
Therefore it is necessary to pursue them with cautery until the infirmity is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Chapter XLIX.
Leprosy sufferers are sometimes greatly helped by cautery.
And especially the kind of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, consider the power to cauterize it itself.
If, therefore, the leprosy is persistent, and you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and it has neither subsided nor ceased; and you fear that the corruption may spread over his entire constitution: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the known head, and a second below it towards the forehead near the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind above the nape of the neck.
And keep your hand with the cautery for a little while, until it makes a small impression on the mouth, and the bark peels away from it: so that the exhalation of gross vapors from it may be alleviated, and cauterize also the spleen with the cautery, as has been previously mentioned.
But if the leprosy has already spread over the afflicted person, and is clearly visible: then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two jaws, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and with six on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the alhasos near the base of the tail and one above it, on the almeidati itself; and with two on the anchas: namely, one on every ancha, and with two on the knees: one on each knee, and with two on the shoulders, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the soft parts of his chest; and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers and feet; and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the folds of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, lest you burn them. And sometimes a cautery is used on the comb bone, and another on the stomach bone, and another on the liver.
And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more it is a help, and the more beneficial.
And know that the sick person does not experience pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that there be cauteries of varying sizes, and small, according to the members and joints; according to what was previously mentioned in the types of instruments.
Chapter L.
When any limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize the numb limb with cauteries, according to the merit of the limb's size, whether great or small.
And let your cautery enter the thickness of the skin a little.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes a cauterization is performed on something that is numb, which happens to the hand, and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exits of the nerves that move that limb, and the numbness is removed.
But let no one presume upon it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of the limbs, and the exit of the moving nerves of the body.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Chapter LI.
When Albaras is old and nothing from the arts of medicine helps it, then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and arnogloss leaves, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood; of each take one part: mix all these together, and spread them on a cloth, and apply to the place, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Chapter LII.
When the Cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, just as it revolves.
However, the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
However, it does not seem to me: because I fear that it will ulcerate, and I have already seen this happen several times. And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries. Concerning the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Chapter LIII.
When someone has an Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excess making it so, or because of the infirmity of age, when he is decrepit, having little blood, or because of the time and the need to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it will hasten with maturation.
If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows the infirm, so that the course of pus may be relieved.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corrosive evil. Chapter LIIII.
Corrosion is not anything other than a corruption that walks in a member, and it corrodes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then use many cauteries of fire, small and large clamps, according to what will be suitable for that place where the corrosive is.
Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains completely. Then leave it for three days, and place powdered sulfur with oil over the cauterized places, until all eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on whatever remains of the corrupted places.
And it is sometimes cured by corrosive medicine.
For it indeed rises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of more rapid help; and I have already said that its cauterization with corrosive medicine is in division; therefore receive it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in corns and warts. Chapter LV.
This ailment often occurs in the lower parts of the feet, and is a thick, filtered substance that hurts the foot. And cautery in them is of two kinds: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for cautery with fire, a concave cautery like the wing of a vulture should be heated; it should be made of iron, the size of the whole corn on all sides, and with thin edges.
Then place it, heated, on the corn. Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the corn, until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn, and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus. Then apply a plaster with crushed wild mallows and salt, and leave the plaster on it overnight. It will indeed be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
If they are not cured and repeatedly occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply a cautery with hot water to them; and you should take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather, and place it on the corn, or blister.
Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, hold your hand, and revolve it with the pressure of your hand for a short while so that the edge of the cannula presses against the root of the corn and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the corn, and let the sick person wait for a while upon the soaking of the hot water for an hour.
Then release him, for the corn is eradicated with its roots.
Do this with each of them one by one, until you have treated all that are on the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Tremor.
Chapter LVI.
When tremor occurs in someone due to cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries, or five, on the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on his chest with a cautery, and on his stomach with a cautery.
For tremor ceases with the olive cautery, and the health of the cold ailment is hastened. Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter LVII.
Sometimes foul things, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body of Albathir, which are formed from corrupted gross matter.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary first to cauterize every pustule on the head with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, whose tip has been heated with fire.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lenticular cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way, and they are not increased; and the superfluity causing them is broken up, and they are healed from them.
However, it is necessary for this to be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Chapter LVIII. Often a flow of blood from an artery occurs, which is cut in a wound, that happens externally, or in the incision of an abscess, or in the cauterization of a limb, and similar to them: and it becomes difficult to cut it off.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery, and press it firmly until the blood is obstructed beneath your finger, and nothing escapes from it. Then place small, olive-shaped cauteries, and many larger ones, in the fire, and blow over them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been ruptured, and place the cautery on the vein itself, after you quickly remove your finger, and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
If it is expelled when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries prepared in the fire. Therefore do not cease to do this with one after another, until the blood is cut off.
And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and another harm befall the sick person. And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four methods.
Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off. Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Or let medicines of a nature to cut off the blood be placed upon it, and let it be tightened with a fitting constriction.
However, whoever performs its excision with a ligature and constriction with cloth, or by applying burning things, and similar methods, does not truly benefit it, except rarely.
If, however, this happens to someone and a physician is not present, nor medicine: then let him begin with the placement of the index finger on the opening of the vein itself, as we have recounted, and with a strong constriction of it, until the blood is blocked from the upper part of the wound and over the artery.
And the finger is not to be removed, but constantly kept over it with very cold water, until the blood is congealed and thickened, and cut off. And meanwhile, let him consider what it needs from a cautery, or from medicine.
End of the First Part.
Albucasis's Surgical Book, Part II. Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
We have already said in the first chapter, concerning every illness in which it is fitting to use cautery with fire, and burning medicine, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries. And I have placed there chapters from the head down to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path: so that the seeker might have his question alleviated. And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, children, to learn that in this chapter there is fear from what is in the first chapter concerning cauterization.
And because of that, it is necessary that there be greater caution in it, since in the operation which is in this chapter, often evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision on an abscess, or opening of an exit, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision on a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling, and fear, and death in many of them fall.
And I warn you, lest that which is hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes the ways of men with the ways of illnesses fall upon you in this art.
For among them is he who is angry with his illness, and death is light to him; because of the intensity that he finds from his illness and the length of its malice.
And with illness is fear that signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his money, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful. Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be stronger than your greed and your rapacity.
And do not presume upon anything of it, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies to you that to which praiseworthy success has come.
And use in the treatment of all your sick people, prognostication and indication of that to which health may properly be.
For in that is help for you in the acquisition of fame and glory, and of memory and praise.
May God, O children, inspire you with his understanding, and may he not take from you direction and inspiration, for it is in his hand.
And I have indeed ordered this Chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, in accordance with what preceded in the Chapter on Cauteries, from the neck down to the feet: so that your search for what you want from it, and what you need, might be eased.
Of the treatment of Water that gathers in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this ailment frequently happens to children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause that is not known.
And I myself have not seen this sickness in others than in children, and death has hastened to all whom I have seen of them: for that reason it seemed to me to omit treatment in it.
And I myself saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until he could not sit on himself because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture, indeed, either collects between the skin and the bone, or collects under the bone above the skin.
And if there is moisture between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head, with a width of approximately two fingerbreadths, until the moisture flows out.
And this is the form of a lancet.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place these two incisions, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from every side, and water is depressed when you press it with your hand inward, and it is not hidden from you, then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head, according to this method.
And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Then apply a fomentation of wine and oil to it until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound with equality.
And feed the weak person with all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and collection of water appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Of the incision of Arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When cataracts occur to someone in the eyes, or in the chest, and it is prolonged, and treatment with medicines is not effective, then the final treatment for that is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to cut them, the sick person should shave their head.
Then rub the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Then the sick person should tighten their neck with any cloth they have.
Then consider where the vein beats.
And the locations of both are the locations which are depressed behind the ears; and it is rarely hidden, except in certain people.
Then mark with ink on both; and cut both with a scalpel on both sides, the incision reaching the bone; and let that be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it upwards with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers.
For when a vein is cut, blood emerges with a pulsating outflow, which leaps inwards with frequent jumps.
If, however, the artery is not apparent to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear the amount of space of three fingers.
Then mark with ink, and cut all the way to the bone.
And that which it is necessary to remove from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you remove from it more, or less. All of that according to the quantity that appears to you from the weakness of the infirm and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound.
Then if anything remains on the bone from the sifac, then cut it, so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a person suffers from a chronic headache, or acute catarrhs due to acrid humors, and heat in the temple's tissues, or a severe, longstanding inflammation, and similar ailments: and is treated with the methods of medical treatment, and it does not help: then we have experience in these illnesses with the extraction of the arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described.
And the method of operation in extracting them is that the patient should shave the hairs that are in the temples, and direct himself towards the visible artery in the temple.
For it indeed shows itself to you by its pulse, and rarely is hidden except in a few people, or by the intensity of cold.
If it is hidden from you, then the patient should tighten his head with any cloth of his: then rub the area with a rough cloth.
Or warm the area with hot water, until it appears to you by clear appearance. Then take the spatula, which I have formed a little earlier. Then scrape the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upward, until you pull it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the tunics that are beneath it on every side.
If however the artery is delicate: then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Then cut a part of it according to the amount by which its extremities will be elongated and contracted, and so that no flow of blood occurs.
For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend completely. Then evacuate from the blood six ounces, up to three.
If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong, double thread, of silk, or of braided cord, so that putrefaction does not quickly occur in the wound before it consolidates, and that a flow of blood may not occur.
Then cut the excess that is between the two ligatures.
Do it at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone, with a surgical cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in place of the same work.
And it is a better work, unless if the sick person has a fever, or is of a hot disposition.
Because cautery is from those things that help to end humidities.
Therefore it is a better aid.
And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cotton, and pads made properly should be placed on it.
And after the solution, treat it with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
If, meanwhile, while you are working, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hurry to cut it off with cautery, or to fill the place with zegi, and bind your hand tightly until the blood is cut off.
If none of those are present for you, then place your finger on the area, until the blood coagulates.
And embrocate the area with water of intense cold, until the sharpness subsides, and it is bound as required.
And because it is easier and less troublesome than extracting the artery, it is to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades: and the sharpness of the two blades should be like an almond.
However, they are of much less sharpness than two blades.
Because if they are sharp, like two blades, the cold rushes to both [blades]: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this, therefore, the work is better than any other work, and easier, and more readily done.
And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger, after you have marked two places with ink: and place both [blades] intensely hot, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between its extremities may be elongated.
For they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of cautery.
Concerning the treatment of persistent acute lacrimal discharge from the eyes.
Chapter Four.
When the tears are persistent, and their flow is from veins situated above the external skull: and no medicinal treatment with medicines avails them, and you see the face of the sick person already flushed, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their eyelashes are already corroded with the corrosion: and his eyelids are heated from the intensity of the tears: then the ancients required this operation for their treatment, and they named that treatment, with the Sword.
And it is, that you should instruct the sick person to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Then make three equally spaced incisions along the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be about two fingers, and one incision be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the length a little from the movement of the temples, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are on the two sides: and move your hand away from the joining of the two jawbones, and let the space of each incision be the amount of three joined fingers: and let you have a piece of prepared sponge, or many dried cloths, with which you dry the blood.
Then insert a probe with two sharp ends, whose following form is this.
From the incision that is on the temple side, up to the second incision: and scrape off with it all the skin, which is between the two incisions, with the sifac, which is above the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Then remove this probe, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, called a sharp scalpel, with one side smooth, not sharp on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and drive it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels, which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
And after a quantity of blood has run, express the places from the clots of congealed blood. Then place in every fissure a linen cloth from old cotton, and place over them cushions soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer much infusion with lukewarm water.
Then treat it with basil ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated: until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of acute tears and cataracts in the eyes from interior parts of the head.
Chapter V.
When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs befall someone; and you see his eyes weakened, small, and their appearance already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, painful, injuring pain deep within the head, and a consequent sneezing: then from these occurrences, know that those matters and catarrhs do not come, except from many veins.
And the better treatment for them is this.
And it is that you should order the sick person to shave his forehead.
Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or another slightly across its width, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be right up to the bone: and you must pull your hand away from the temporal muscles, which move during chewing: until when the bone is exposed: and you shall dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with old cloth, or with linen strips.
Then bind above with poultices: and soak the poultices with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you loosen it, and see that the hot abscess is already lessening: then it is necessary that you rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow: such as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony: and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear. Chapter VI. Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpea and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water and vinegar, and things like them; or some animal.
Therefore, when a stone, or a type of stone from those which are not added or grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you see a stone, then instill into the ear something of violet oil, or sesame oil.
Then administer its extraction, and cause sneezing with condiments, and close the nostrils at the time of the sneeze, after you place in a circle around the ear pieces of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
For often it departs with this treatment.
If however it does not depart, then administer its extraction with instruments, that is, with small tweezers; whose form is this.
If therefore it departs with the instruments, it is good.
And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine, single-hooked, thin instrument. If therefore it does not depart through that, then make a tube of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole very far, and seal that which is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no passage to the wind except through the tube; then extract with your wind by a strong suction. For often it departs with that which we have narrated.
If however it does not depart in this way, then take a small amount of helkalimbat, or of viscous, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, and place it on the end of the probe after you have carefully wrapped a bandage around it: then introduce it into the ear hole with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not depart with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incision, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of incision is, that a leeches be applied first to the cephalic vein: and extract from it blood according to the measure of his strength.
Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, near his fat in the depressed area there: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever instruments you can.
Then stitch the incision from your hour with speed, and care for it until it heals.
If the thing falling into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
If, however, it does not yield to you to exit, then take a thin, slender spatula, according to this form.
And administer it with that to cut out that type of grain that falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that grain has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it into many fragments: then extract them with hooks, or with a fine tweezers, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is thus relieved.
However, in the water that enters the ear, it is necessary that the weak person use sneezing with condiments first; and now he has filled his ear with some old cotton; and he lies on that ear in which the water is.
If therefore it exits through that, it is good.
And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire for a short time, and let the weak person insert one of them into the hole of his ear: and let him jump on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone on the stone that is in the ear.
Therefore, let him not cease doing that with stone and stone, until all the water exits.
And now the water exits in such a way that you take one from papyrus, or from reed, and insert one end of it into the ear; and light the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Then repeat with another reed, and do this many times, until all the water exits: and extract it with a cannula according to what was stated before concerning the stone.
In extracting an animal entering it, if it is of small body, like a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all those which are held in the ear.
In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to examine the ear in the sun.
If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the shape, narrow at the bottom, wide at the top; and introduce the slender end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates it; then suck with a strong suction.
Do this many times, until all the worms emerge.
If, however, they do not obey you for exit, then coat the surrounding area of the cannula with wax, as I said in the stone.
If, however, they do not emerge with what we have said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have already used in the killing of worms, and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring of oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, the form of which is depicted here.
As you see, make it from silver or bronze, narrowed at the bottom, in which there is a small hole, wider at the top.
Let the impelling thing that is in the concavity of the cannula be made of bronze, properly made.
And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap linen around its end with a proper wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you desire into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then introduce the rod with the linen from above, and squeeze it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is driven into the cavity of the hearing, and the sick person feels it inside; and whatever is poured into the ear should be warmed with fire for a short time; and beware lest the distilled substance be excessively cold, for medicines do not tolerate that.
Concerning the treatment of sudden ear blockage.
Chapter VII.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And it happens also to some people that blockage in the ear canal comes from a wound or flesh growing in it.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear cavity, where sight does not reach it; and sometimes it happens near the outer part of the cavity, and sight follows it.
Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which the sight does not encompass, is in many cases difficult to cure.
And in that which is followed by sight, you must place the patient's ear in the sun and look at it.  Then if you see the blockage appearing, open it with a thin probe, whose form is as follows, having a small, slightly pointed width at one end, and the rest of the probe smooth-sided, so as not to injure the ear.
If therefore the blockage is from flesh grown in the ear canal, then grasp it with a thin hook and cut it away forcefully, until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod, and heat it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
If, therefore, you sense a blockage with the patient experiencing hearing difficulty, attempt to open it gently, and beware of injuring the nerves of the ear.
Then place a bandage, according to the size of the opening you have made, and wrap it in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days, until you are certain the wound is healing.
Or take a bandage, soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle ground zegi powder on it, and use it.
If you see that the ear is already suppurating, then you must remove the bandage and replace it with another bandage wrapped in a caerota made from rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides; then treat it until it heals.
If, however, bleeding occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water, and place it on the ear; and use the remaining treatment, which stops the bleeding, as described in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of ulcers of the eyelids.
Chapter VIII. These ulcers that occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary to grasp them with forceps, or with a hook, and to cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Then apply a crushed lapis to the affected area.
If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lenticular cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
For they often return when something remains from their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of granulations of the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter IX.
Often something happens in the eyelids that is similar to granulation in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called granulation: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you should consider then, if it is granulation proceeding from that which appears of the eyelid, and moves to every part, and its matter is easy.
Therefore, make a fissure upon it across its width.
Then scrape it from every side with ease, until it escapes.
Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
However, if its excision is not prepared for you unless after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision for a short time, then that harms the sick person in some way.
If the fissure is large, then gather it with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it and makes it flesh again.
And if the granulation is sloping towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the granulation with a hook; besides which, you need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is prolonged by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the granulation with salt water, and treat the place with that which makes flesh, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the ailment of the eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the tunics of the upper eyelid, and it happens most often in children.  It weighs down their eyes, and they suffer from catarrhs in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight, because tears flow quickly to them.  Because of this, you see them always lying on their faces, and they sleep on them. Their eyelids, now covered by swelling, are moist beneath their eyebrows.  And the prominent Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
And the method of its operation is that the sick person should place their head in your bosom.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare a bandage on it, and make a circle from that bandage according to the size that encompasses the Axirnath from every side.
Then place it over it, and press with your fingers from every side, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Then make a slit in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, going through the width, and let the slit not be larger than that made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it is necessary that you pierce the entire skin, until you reach the Axirnath, for in many arrangements the Axirnath proceeds from the slit according to the shape of a piece of white fat.
Therefore, pull it out with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers to the outside; and you will turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed; and beware, lest you add to the slit, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet, and injure it.
However, if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the slit, you will add a little to the slit with ease, until Axirnath proceeds.
Then extract it, as we said.
Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind it with bandages.
And there are men who rub salt, and put it in the concavity of the fissure, so that the moisture remaining from it may liquefy.
Then treat it until it heals.
If however a hot abscess occurs in the place, then treat it with sedative plasters until it heals.
Concerning the methods of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, causing it to wrinkle improperly.
Chapter XI.
When extra hairs grow in the eyelids, beyond the natural course of hairs, and they multiply, they harm the eye and cause ailments, such as constant weeping, softening of the eyelids, and clouding, until it becomes a cause of the eye's destruction.
And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed cured according to four methods. Or by cautery with fire.
Or with sharp medicine, according to what was said previously in the chapter on cautery.
Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suturing.
Or by canes, according to what I will say.
It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it is turned, it is good.
And if not: introduce a needle into it, in which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and cause the needle with the thread to penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a radius.
Then find in the inner part of the eyelid beneath the hairs, adding a spatula incident from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton, or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with ink, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that it be shaped according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since it is already diversified in humans.
For among them is one who needs a large amount to be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount softened by the eyelid. Then, with the spatula, make an incision along the two lines that you marked, beginning at the larger tear duct and continuing to the smaller tear duct.  Let the incision be close to the natural hairs, as thick as a ray.
Then insert a hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then scrape it all away. Then bring together the two lips with a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and fasten any excess thread to the two eyebrows, with certain disguising substances, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the suture and threads for up to three or four days; afterwards, treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and treat it with something that dries and constricts it.
For the eyelid is raised by sealing the wound and bringing it together; but it will be better.
The ancients taught this method of treatment.
However, there is care for the weak person in it, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Then lift the eyelid with three separate hooks, or gathered together, according to this following form, then cut what is superfluous with small shears, according to this form, with equal incision.
If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal to it: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and gather together the threads between your fingers with equality.
Then raise your hand with equal elevation; and raise the skin upon which the marked area is, as we have narrated.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture; and treat it until it is healed.
If however an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with a cauter, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that its hairs are turned.
Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with canes.
And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure that is within, according to what I have described.
Then, skillfully make two canes, or two slender pieces of wood, whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a spatula: and you have already incised at the extremities of each, from both sides, where you hold the threads.
Then carefully attach each to the excess of the eyelid, and tightly tie the two canes from both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for several days. For the tightened skin will die, and turn black, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Then treat it until it heals.
When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two canes, which you shall make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
Concerning the raising of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The operation in that is, that you take a thin needle, and introduce into it a fine, soft silk thread. Then gather its ends, and tie each end with a very small knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place another fine thread beneath it in the Alinxotati, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then let the sick person place his head in your lap, and be close to the light so that the operation is clear: because it is a delicate, or small, operation.
Then introduce the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up above the alinxotati: and introduce into the alinxotati that hair: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the alinxotati from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
However, if the alinxotati is pulled out, and the hair does not come out with it: pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you have placed in it, until the alinxotati comes out from the upper opening, and you see it with the eye's vision: then you shall pull the alinxotati and the thread: and remove both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
If however the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and lift it with it: or leave it, until it lengthens after a time, and then lift it.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati occurring in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental therefore results from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to them.
And the method of treatment in it is that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and place in that which is between them a linen bandage, and tie it, until it is healed.
And you should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather, use in it things that soften, such as fenugreek: and embrocate with water, in which has been cooked marshmallow, flaxseed: and with the unguent dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some of the oils: and wrap with it a bandage, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you should strive with all your ingenuity to prevent its consolidation, according to the form it had in the first place.
And this operation which we have described is, in fact, merely a rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the shape of the area does not return to what it was entirely. Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which occurs below, is the one truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental one is caused by a wound, or a fissure, or a cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operation in it is to take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and to dip it into the flesh, and to make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the flesh at both ends.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
If therefore the eyelid's shape returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a ray, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and a corner is made from them: until when they come together, their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from what follows the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts: sew it with wool thread.
Then treat them with what we have said, of softening medicines, and bandages, until they are healed.
And if a cataract occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we have said.
And the summary of the treatment of a cataract, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the cataract.
For indeed there are many varieties in form; and a skillful craftsman prepares a method in whatever way is possible for him, until he restores the shape to the natural form, or nearly so, and himself, the affected part, according to what is appropriate to it from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this adhesion occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural functions.
Therefore, you should insert the end of a probe under the eyelid and lift it up; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp, but slightly blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed and damages the eye with its sharpness; and your incision should be like scraping away the adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then, pour salty water into the eye, washing it with water; or distil it from a vessel made of lead, dissolved with water.
Then, separate the eyelid and eye with linen; and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after three days use lead and consolidants, until healed.
Concerning the incision of the toenail and the fleshy prominence of the tear ducts.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the toenail is according to two ways. Or it is nervous: and it is similar to hard, subtle sifac.
Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is severed, and the hook does not fix itself to it.
And both types do not begin, unless from the larger tear duct, until it goes gradually, until it covers the sight, and hinders the light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operation in its incision is: that the sick person should place his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Then gather the nail with a hook of few foldings, and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, or ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair, until its last part.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear-duct flesh, so that no constant flow of tears may occur from its incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with a thread, as we have said.
Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, which has this form.
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the horny tunic, and that a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is pierced.
Then, after the incision, put some crushed salt into the eye, or a preparation made from ziniar, and leave it until the next day.
Then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed. If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is treated many times with medicines, and is healed as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye, and take a thin, gentle, and weakly pointed spatula, according to this form.
And shave the nail from above with precision.
If you see that it thins and breaks, and the shaving imprints on it, then distil from your hour glass a solution made from ziniar, or from red sief, or crushed salt: and poultice the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the operation on it until the whole of it is removed.
Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye, in which case leave it, and treat the abscess until it heals. Then repeat the operation on it with a razor, until it heals.
If, however, a fleshy prominence of the tear duct is harmful to the eye with great injury, it should be suspended with a hook and a portion of it cut away: and do not make the incision too deep, so that the flow of tears is not obstructed.
Then instill into the tear duct a red ointment, or one made from ziniari, until it heals. Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh grown in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes red flesh grows in some people's eyes, either composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil or comes close to it or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it resembles a rose-hip.
And the treatment in it is also that the sick person should place their head in your lap.
Then open their eyes, and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks: and hold it with a single forceps, or tongs.
Then cut the flesh in the first place, until the whole of it is finished with the scalpel.
And be careful of the eye, so that you do not harm it during the operation; and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a scalpel, as we described in the incision of the hoof; or with small scissors, with which the asebel is gathered, according to its form, as it will appear after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is complete, and the entire alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or distill into it red powder, and similar corrosives from the medicines; and place over the eye externally a cloth with egg white; so that it is protected from a hot abscess.
If anything of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye, and treat it with that which quiets the abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
And do likewise with the added flesh that occurs in the eye from this type.
However, it is necessary to avoid treating any weak eye by a natural or accidental way, operating with iron; and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that that member is tolerant of that operation.
Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. Sebel are red veins woven over the eye, and they hinder the eye's function of sight; and they weaken the eye with the length of the days.
Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye in which the Sebel is present is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides the Sebel; then collect its Sebel.
And it is, that you should instruct the sick person to place his head in your bosom.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be a thin double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded on one body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with fine scissors with care, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and are dissolved; and beware lest you injure the eye with the extremities of the forceps.
And let your operation be in the midday sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye a green or red sief, so that its sharpness may corrode what remains of the sebil.
However, if it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the eye's pain, and leave it for a few days until its pain subsides and is secure from a hot abscess; then repeat upon it according to the same method until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps.
Concerning the reduction of a fractured nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call a fractured nose a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharp burning medicine, according to the preceding account of it.
And if it does not heal, then there is no remedy for it, except to pierce above the abscess at its origin, and to extract all the moisture and pus from it, until the bone is exposed.
When the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness on it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose shape is this.
And it is called a rough head.
Let it be made from tempered iron, and let its head be round like a hazelnut, pointed with a file, or with a fine aliskilfer point; and place it upon the corrupted spot of bone. Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times.
Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times. Then restore the place with drying astringent medicines.
If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not become an abscess, and no accident occurs in it; then know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril's opening, according to this form.
And it is, so that you expose the second bone with an iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron tip be triangular; and its wood be a pyramid tapering to the tip, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself; and let it be near the tear duct; and move your hand slightly away from the eye.
Then rotate your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the sick person feels it; through this that he finds air coming out from it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh grows, and the place hardens, then the matter that was discharged to the exterior returns to the nose; therefore it is less burdensome upon the sick person.
Of the reduction of the prominent eye. Chapter XX.
When the eye protrudes completely, and no harm occurs to the sight, nor any diminution, then you should release the patient; then bleed him; afterwards place cupping glasses on the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then place on the eye a liniment made from acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Then bind the eye from above with a plaster and many bandages.
And the method of the bandages is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth is doubled over four times; make many of these; then place them one over the other, according to the amount needed for the eye; then bind over them with a hard cloth with strong constriction.
And again use cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound day and night.
If however the bandage softens again, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly; then remove the bandage after one day and night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye already restored to the integrity of the tunic, it is good; and if not, then again apply the plaster, and bandages, and constriction, and cupping glasses, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the tunic.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the eye's tunic, then it protrudes and comes forth outside the eyelids like a grain of the eye, and the man's appearance is disfigured because of it, and one wishes to cut it; then the operation is as follows, as I relate: to insert a needle into the root of the eye from the lower part to the upper.
Then introduce another needle, on which is a double thread from the tear duct side, and let it penetrate; and leave the first needle in its position.
Then cut the place of the double thread, and bind with it the part of the eye around the needle; and tightly tighten it.
Then withdraw the needle, and place on the eye wool soaked in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread comes away with the eye.
Then treat the eye with whatever strengthens it, until the wound heals.
And sometimes the eye is tightened on all sides with a bandage of cloth, until the eye gains great prominence.
Then it is pierced with a fine probe that reaches the depth of the eye, and the white fluid runs out, and the eye descends, and immediately enters: then tighten it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Chapter XXII.
This disease, called Alcomnat, is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not the eye itself.
And the method of treatment in it is that you make the sick person sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it until you see the pus descend to the lower part of your eyes.
Then let it be fixed, and do not let it descend, and let the light be released: and let the sick person see things as he saw them before: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula and split with it above the horny membrane a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, at the crown, until pus comes out.
When it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already discussed the kinds of water in division, and what is suitable for piercing, the speech declaring and explaining; then take that same one according to health.
Then therefore it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye, and tie it tightly; then with your right hand, the eyelid of his eye in which the water is, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then take with your right hand an almond, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then place the tip of the almond near the crown, by the thickness of a ray, in the apparent white of the lesser tearful eye; then drive the almond with force; and you revolve your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye; and you feel that the almond has now reached the empty thing.
And it is necessary that the measure of the almond's journey to the depth be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye.
For you will see it in the very pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the almond to the place where the water is.
Then press it lower, one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that on which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Then rest a little.
If therefore the water descends, then place it down a second time, except that the almond emerges.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend, then extract the almond with ease, and you will turn your hand gradually. Then dissolve some clear gem salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it.
Then place the entire wad of lint, or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, over the eye, and bandage the sound eye with it.
We, and those of our time, place crushed cumin with egg white on it.
If the almond does not yield to you for entry into the eye because of its hardness, since it is from humans whose eye is very hard, then it is necessary to take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Therefore, scrape it with it only the conjunctiva, and do not insert your hand into the aperture; and there is nothing but to make a subtle path for the almond's place.
Then introduce the almond, according to what we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient a suitably constructed sleeping place, in which he shall sleep on his back in a darkened room; and prohibit him from all movement, and from coughing; and place before him food that will soothe his nature; and do not allow him to move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage remain according to its arrangement until the third day. Then loosen it in that darkened room, and test his sight; and have him look at objects.
Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not necessary that he do it at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it is necessary to delay it; because water ascends quickly through violent sight.
If, however, a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh day, and to treat it with that which assuages the abscess, until it is calmed; then unbind his sight and place upon his face an oral remedy that controls his sight for a few days, having him remain in that darkened room.
Then let him gradually leave the house, and go about his affairs.
And know that in a zalia a student is not excused from a sight several times; then indeed he may dare on the operation.
And now indeed one of those from Alayrach has come to us, who said that in Alayrach a perforated magdan was made, from which water is drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that, nor have I read of it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the species from the magdan, so that one who is ignorant of them may stand upon it.
Let them be made properly of bronze; and let their extremities be triangular with the same subtlety, and pointed.
Forms of the magdan.
Concerning the treatment of flesh born in the nose.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
Sometimes diverse growths of flesh are born in the nose, some of which resemble a scorpion with many feet; and from this there is cancerous, stony flesh, of a dark colour; and from this there is soft flesh, not of a dark colour.
Therefore, in the case of the soft flesh among these growths, not deceitful nor cancerous, you should have the sick person sit between your hands facing the ground, and open their nostrils, and insert a hook into the flesh; then draw it outward, and cut what you have grasped from it with a fine sharp scalpel on one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
If anything remains from it, whose removal is not possible, then scrape it with one of the fine instruments with ease, until nothing remains of it.
If, however, blood prevails, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it until the blood is severed and all the flesh is removed.
Then, after the incision, vinegar, and water, or wine, should be placed into the nose.
If, however, the nose opens, and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is now healthy.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate, as it should, then know that within it is flesh grown on the upper nasal bones, to which the instrument did not reach during the incision.
Then, therefore, it is necessary that you insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place a finger's width, or less, between each knot.  And let the sick man, with a rod or whatever he can, bring one end of the thread into his nose, having made it like a [certain] shape. And pull on his thread until it reaches the [affected] mass, and emerges at his throat.
And many times children in schools make something similar to this [using] atoms; and it is an easy thing for him who wishes.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that emerges from the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Then cut away the flesh with the knots that are on the thread. Do that until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread; and after cleansing the blood, place in the nose a compress soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment has corroded all that remains of the flesh.
Then place a lead cannula at the end of the object in the nose, for several days, until it heals.
If however it needs a treatment that will dry it, use that.
To make a nasal douching, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze: that it should be like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula, like a pipe.
And the shell of the instrument for nasal douching should be full, uncovered; with a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish from juices and fluid substances.
And this is the form of the instrument. Concerning the treatment of nasal warts.
Chapter XXV.
Often a wart is born on the tip of the nose, and it grows larger and increases with the days until its appearance becomes unsightly.
And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, you should cauterize it and eradicate all of it.
Then place over the site either a cautery or a burning medicine that stands in its place.
If, therefore, its incision is delayed until it becomes enlarged, then consider, if it is stony, hard, of a dark colour, with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
For many times I have seen that whoever incises such an abscess, and great harm comes upon the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the diseased part, and incise it without fear, without anxiety: and treat the site with that which dries and constricts it, until it is healed.
Concerning the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little benefit comes from treatment, except in some people.
Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then assemble the wound's edges with sutures; then treat it until it is healed.
And if the separated lips of the discontinuity are now each part whole, then you must scrape away every part from its apparent skin until it bleeds.
Then, assemble the two edges with sutures, and tighten them, and powder the blood of a dragon, and crushed frankincense, over it; and place a piece of a diafinicon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters, upon the powders; and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then unbind it, and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads separate by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of suture is, that you assemble the discontinuity either with needles, as we have described in the suture of the belly; or assemble the discontinuity with thread, as I have caused you to know.
Concerning the extraction of lip nodules.
Chapter XXVII. Many men frequently have hard abscesses resembling grains of herbs on the interior of their lips; and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you turn the lip, and cut over every nodule on it, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it away from every side.
Then you should fill the place after the incision with bruised zegi until the blood is cut off.
Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place, where there is astringency, should be treated with it until the wounds are healed.
Concerning the incision of fleshy growth on the gums.
Chapter XXVIII. Often fleshy growth grows on the gums, which the ancients call abuluss.
Therefore, you should suspend it with a hook; or hold it with forceps, and cut it near its root, and allow the pus, or blood, to run.
Then place on the area ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
Concerning the extraction of teeth with iron.
Chapter XXIX.
Sometimes rough, unsightly, and sometimes blackened, yellowish, or greenish scabs gather on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer sides, and between the gums, until that corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become unsightly because of it.
Therefore, you should have the patient sit between your hands, with their head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth, where the scabs, like sand, appear, until none of them remain; and similarly deal with blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other such things until they are cleaned.
If, therefore, that which is on them from the beginning of the scraping is removed, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another, second, and third day, until finally the desired result is achieved.
And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes and forms, according to what is prepared for your operation; therefore, the scraper with which a tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the scraper used for scraping between the teeth, according to other shapes.
And let these shapes of scrapers be prepared by you, as you see them.
Concerning the extraction of toothache.
Chapter Thirty.
You ought to treat the tooth from its pain with all ingenuity, and delay in its eradication.
For there is nothing to replace it when it is eradicated; because it is a superior substance.  Until, when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary when the infirm is compelled to eradicate it, that it may be strengthened, and that the aching tooth may be certified by you.
For pain often deceives the infirm, and they think that it is in the tooth's substance and eradicate it; afterwards the pain does not recede, until the infirm's tooth is eradicated.
For we have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certified by you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side; then move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps at first gently, until you break it.
Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and place the patient's head between your knees: which you have already held firmly, so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not emerge, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from every side with ease, and try its movement, as you did at first.
If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth; and bind it with the end of a thin radius, so that it does not break in the moment of your constriction upon it with the forceps.
And it is necessary that you act skillfully with the scarification around the gum from every side very much.
And maintain your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person from that malice which is greater pain than his first pain.
And beware, lest you do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and their boldness over its eradication, beyond what we have described.
For very often they cause great illnesses upon men, which are more difficult to break, and the roots of it all remain, or some of them; or to extract it with some of the jawbones; as we have testified many times. Then it should be washed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt. If a flow of blood occurs from those places (for it often does), then rub some of the zegi and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if zegi does not help you.
The forms of the fine forceps with which the tooth is initially moved should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick, so that they do not double when pressed upon the tooth.  They should be like those with thick handles, such that when you tighten them, they do not give way, nor double; with short extremities, and made of tempered iron, or well-made steel, with straight extremities.  And on their extremities be teeth, some entering into others, and tightening with a proper, strong constriction.
And sometimes the extremities are made like the shape of the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Of the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
Chapter XXXI.
When, during the extraction of a tooth, a piece remains, then it is necessary to apply a poultice with butter for one or two days, until the area softens.  Then introduce the forceps, or pliers, whose extremities resemble the beak of the bird called a stork.
The form of these pliers is...
Their extremities should be made like a file within; or like an aliskilfegi.
If, therefore, it does not yield to removal with these pliers, then it is necessary to carefully expose the root and remove all flesh, and introduce the instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short, somewhat thick: and let it not be soaked, lest it break.
If, therefore, the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with other instruments, whose forms are these.
The form of the first is triangular with a certain thickness at the extremity.
The form of a triangular, slender extremity.
It is also aided by this instrument having two branches, whose form is this. And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the treatment of teeth.
Also, there is assistance with this instrument, which resembles a large hook, of this form: triangular extremity twisted, where there is some thickness so that it does not break; and it should not be soaked.
And know that there are many instruments for teeth, and likewise other instruments are not to be counted, and a skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument according to which the operation and the illnesses themselves indicate to him.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not describe an instrument, due to the diversity of their types.
If, however, a bone breaks from the jaw or from other bones of the mouth, or if it rots, then probe over it in its place with what is appropriate for it from the instruments and forceps that I have mentioned in the extraction of roots, and assist with forceps, whose shape is this.
Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone is gripped or held with it, and does not escape and move away until the bone comes out; and restore the place with suitable medicines for it.
If, however, there is a small rot in the bone, then scrape it of its rot, and treat it until it is healed.
Of the filing of teeth that project over others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth project not according to their natural course, an ugly shape is made by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those who are available.
For if a tooth is born after another tooth and is not positioned properly, or its filing or grinding is not possible, then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose shape is this.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision, by which you cut it, be in many days, and because of the tooth's hardness, and so that another tooth is not moved.
If however it is prominent, exposed to its grinding: then grind it with a file of tempered steel, whose shape is this.
Let the whole be of tempered steel, and its handle of small, fine points, like the file with which needles are made: with which the tooth is ground gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then smooth it, finally scrape it with some scrapers.
If, however, it is a tooth from which a piece has broken off, and it injures the tongue: then it is necessary to file it also, until the roughness of that break is removed, and it is made even: and flattened, and it does not injure the tongue, nor impair speech.
Concerning the retention of teeth with gold wires.
Chapter XXXIII.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and displacement from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on it without it falling out, and you have treated them with astringent remedies, and the treatment has not been successful, then the remedy is to bind them with a gold wire, because silver turns green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
And let the wire be medium in thinness and thickness according to the amount that it will take between the teeth.
And the method of retention is to take a wire, and insert twice its length between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the wire between the loosened teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weaving to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Then repeat the weaving to the part from which you began; and bind your hand with care and skill until it is completely fixed; and let your tightening of the wire be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Then cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors; and bring both together, and shape them with pliers; and conceal them between the healthy tooth and the loosened tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it be so tight that it remains.
If however it loosens or cuts, tighten them with another wire, and it will stay with it throughout this time.
And this is the method for teeth, and the manner of retaining two healthy teeth, and two loosened teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one tooth, or two, returns after the fall of each to its place, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and only a skillful, prudent, and experienced craftsman can accomplish this.
And sometimes some of the vaccini bones are adapted; and it is made like the form of a tooth, and placed in the place from which the tooth is strengthened and tightened, as we said; and it remains, and is preserved with it for a long time.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue and hinders speech.
Chapter Thirty-four.
If there is anything hard and knotted in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound, then insert a hook into it, and split it across, until you cut the ligament, and the knot is released.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then place ground zegi over the area. If, however, blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a lentil-shaped cautery, suitable for it; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed. Concerning the extraction of a Ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural function, and perhaps it magnifies so much that it fills the mouth.
If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, to which the sick person finds no sensation: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then throw a hook into it, and cut it with a thin spatula, and free it from every side.
If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place crushed zegi upon it until the blood is stemmed; then return to your operation until you extract it with its entirety.
Then it should be washed with vinegar and salt, and treat it with the appropriate further treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then you will either perforate it, or it will burst on its own.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is fine, then it is necessary to cut it.
And the operation on it is, that you consider before its operation, if its abscess has rested completely, cooled, or diminished by some diminution; then therefore make the infirm person sit in the sun, and his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let the servant take between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, whose shape is this. Let it be made of silver, or of bronze, which is as thin as a knife.
Therefore, when you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it, then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as you can, besides pulling out with it some of the membranes.
Then cut it with an instrument, whose form follows this.
It is like shears; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other sharply; therefore, take care that it is made of tempered iron, or imbued with alfuled.
If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is this.
One side should be sharp, the other side not sharp.
And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision.
Then, after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If however a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled; or the leaves of myrtle, and things similar to those from astringents, until the flow of blood is stopped; then treat him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore, cut it according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I myself have already treated a woman from an abscess which had arisen between her throat, which was drawing to blackness, few sensations, which had nearly closed her throat; and the woman was breathing from a constricted passage, and I had already forbidden her eating and drinking water; and she had already reached death, if it had remained for one day or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had emitted two branches, until they had emerged above the two nostrils.
Therefore, I hastened quickly, and I fixed a hook in one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion came out from it.
Then I cut it, where I grasped it from the nostril.
Then I did the same to that which proceeded from the other nostril.
Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterward I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut off a part of it, and only a little blood ran from it.  Therefore, the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then ate food.
Therefore, I did not cease cutting from that abscess for a long time; and the abscess succeeded in the place of that which I was cutting, until it was excessively prolonged with it.
Therefore, I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore, it stood from the addition; then I departed from that place, and did not know what God did with it after me.
Concerning the incision of the abscess of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes abscessed, and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the abscess, hot, has ceased from it, and is subtle; then it is necessary that you incise it.
And that which is gathered from it, round, and has no length, and is bloody, or of a brown color, or black, and has no sensation: then it is necessary that you avoid its incision.
For in it is fear over the sick person.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner which I have said, from its whiteness and length, you should make the sick person sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument, of which the narration has preceded; then fix the hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards; and incise it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you do not incise from it, unless that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you incise from it more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use that which we have narrated in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it heals.
If, however, the sick person is terrified by the incision, then it is necessary that you employ skill in cauterizing it without fear and trembling.
And the method of the cautery on it is not except with sharp water; and it is that you place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Then press his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned.
Then take from the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and make with it an unquenched lime, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, which has this form.
Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be, like the concavity of a spoon's radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself; and let the sick person lie on his side, so that saliva may run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it into his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you shall keep it upon the uvula for a quantity of half an hour, until you see it already blackened and the biting of the medicine quieted.
And if you wish to take a poultice, and wrap it about the extremity of the radius, and infuse the poultice with the medicine, and introduce the radius with the poultice into the cannula from above, until the poultice adheres to the uvula. Do it many times, until you achieve what you wish of cauterization of the uvula.
Then leave it: for it will dry and fall after three, or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe the circumference of the uvula with a poultice soaked in butter, and cleanse with that which is around it from the medicine; and wash it with cold water.
And treat it externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
This kind of treatment is therefore healthier than incision and farther from danger.
And sometimes the uvula is treated even with something finer than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Take mint, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs from them: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and steep them in vinegar, and boil them: and let the pot be plastered with suitable clay: and there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which the concave instrument is placed, in this way.
Let it be made of silver, or of bronze: and let the end, in which is the pomegranate, be inserted into the patient's mouth, until the vapor ascends to the uvula above the cannula, until the uvula is greatly darkened.
Then repeatedly over it, until it dries.
And beware, that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's arrival.
For it usually adds to the abscess: and it is not necessary that you do that, except at the decline of its hot abscess.
If however this instrument is not present to you, then take a reed, and place on its end the rind of an egg: so that the patient's mouth is not burned: because the rind of an egg prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is a good treatment with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract that which is apparent from them, upon which the sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the sun, and it is made clear to you what is in the throat.
And that which is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the vomiting weak before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached thing will come out by vomiting.
Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or a small piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge, and tie it to a thread, then swallow it.
When therefore it reaches the place where the spines or bone are, and it is drawn out, then it goes out. If therefore it does not come out with what we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be thicker than a reed a little, and at its extremity let there be a curve, which he should insert into his throat with ease; and let him have his head raised up.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest a cough befall him, and let him push with it a bone or spine, or let the physician insert it with his hand.
But that which the sick person inserts is better, because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing; and let him push downward, or pull his hand upward with the instrument, the whole of it according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it emerges.
Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Chapter XXXIX.
When a leech is medicated with what I have said in the division on treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick person in front of the sun, or in the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with delicate slender forceps.
If it is not possible with them, then take a concave cannula, and insert it into the throat of the sick person until near the throat; then insert into the concavity of the cannula a heated iron with fire.
Do that many times; and let the sick person abstain from water the whole day.
Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
If, however, it does not exit with what we have described, then fumigate the sick person with lice, or with asa, with the instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do that many times, for it will fall itself.
And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which are live prunes with fire; and the pot is covered with a cover, in whose middle is a hole; and the extremity of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then, project the fumigation, and let the sick person place his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
For the leech will immediately fall.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salty things, and garlic, and not drink water. Therefore, it is necessary that it depart with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is drawn out from the throat, when it falls upon it as seen.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: unless because it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat.
And its extremity is similar to the mouth of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and their general care.
Chapter XL.
There are many kinds of abscesses, of various types, according to the recollection of them, that is to say, one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation, and incision from two ways.
One of which is from the type of abscess in itself, and because it is comprised of humors.
And the second way is because of the places in which it occurs in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy area is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And of abscesses, there are some which should not be punctured, unless after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion; and of them there are some which should be punctured while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.
Such as abscesses which are near the joints.
Because an abscess, when it occurs near a joint, and its duration extends until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; therefore, it is a more proximate cause of the contraction of that limb.
Or it is an abscess near a main limb; for if you delay its incision until it matures, it will harm either that limb or the main limb through it.
Or it is near the anus; therefore, incise it unripe; and it is not necessary to incise an unripe abscess, not of complete digestion, except for one near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become incurable at its end. It is necessary to know the time of incision of a mature abscess, according to its completion: and it is through the calming of pain, the recession of fever, the diminishing of redness, and pulsation, and the sharpness of the abscess's head; and the other signs. And it is necessary that you make the same incision in the lower place of the abscess, and of more prominent eminence: and let the incision be directed longitudinally along the body, if the abscesses are in the hands and feet, and the places of tendons, and chords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those that are reflected, proceed with the incision according to that limb.
However, when the abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better to leave its incision until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to its completion.
Because if you incise it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much dirt and filth, and perhaps its edges and depth become hardened.
And some abscesses are incised across the body at need, or according to the limb that requires it.
And it is necessary that you administer a small incision in small abscesses, and a large incision in large abscesses, or multiple incisions similar in size to the abscess.
And there are some abscesses in which the skin must be hollowed out and incised when it has already become like a rag, and has reached a stage where it is already dead, like that which happens in many boils and buboes.
And some of them are incised with an incision having three angles.
And from among them is that which is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like an inguinal abscess.
And from among them are some in which a round incision, and a lunate incision are administered, and similar incisions to these.
That which does not have a head, however, such as mild superficial abscesses, should be pierced with a superficial or merely a flat perforation.
And when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, you should not be hasty and extract all the pus at that hour; rather, extract a part of it.
Then cover the abscess until another day.
Then extract some more pus.
Do this repeatedly according to a gradual method, until it exits; especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an aged and decrepit person: for the animal spirit is often resolved by the exit of pus; and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
If therefore the abscess wound is small, or is a flat incision, then apply bandages of linen, or old tow.
And if the abscess is large, and the perforations' fissures are numerous, it is then necessary that you insert a bandage into every fissure, until they meet each other.
And if in the abscess you have excised a part of the skin, or have hollowed it out around the edges, then it is necessary that you fill it with old tow, or as when cloth is woven, or the down of linen is shaved off without moisture, and bind it tightly until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with whatever ointment is appropriate, until it is healed.
If however, a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then apply cold water, and vinegar, after they are soaked into a cloth, and place it repeatedly on the site of the bleeding.
If, however, the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have described in many places in this book of ours, and by division.
If, however, it is during the winter season, and the area of the abscess is densely innervated, then it is necessary that you insert cushions with hot wine and oil, and place them over the affected areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then it is necessary that you place cushions soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make it all cold.
Until when the third day shall come, as we have said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer the treatment appropriate for it, until it is healed.
This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
According to the path of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how the way to its treatment is chaptered individually.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur in the scalp.
Chapter XLI.
Small abscesses occur in the scalp, and are of the type of Nodes, which are contained within tunics that are like sacs to them; as if they were the pouched crops of a hen.
And their types are many.
Some are fatty; and some contain moisture like mud; and some contain moisture like bran and gruel; and similar to these, and some are hard, stony.
And there is no fear in the incision and extraction of all of them, provided that their incision does not oppose an artery.
And the procedure in their incision is to examine them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial longitudinal incision, according to this form.
And begin with an incision from line b to line g. When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the container that holds the moisture, and do not leave anything from it at all.
For it often returns if anything remains from it. Then immerse the cotum in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remains from the container. Then again apply the cotum with Egyptian ointment a second, and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing has remained from the container; then treat the wound with the ointment, until it is healed.
If the abscess contains a fatty lump, then cut it according to this shape, the incision having the shape of a cross; and insert hooks between the two sides of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and try your skill in extracting the tissue that contains it.
If, however, an artery resists you, then do that which I will tell you afterward.
And similarly do in the abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said. And the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because there is little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in some people, in which there is not moisture at all.
Or make a perforation of them always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus may be relieved downwards.
Then treat it with whatever is suitable for them from the treatment.
Concerning the incision of Whitlows on the neck.
Chapter XLII.
These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And concerning those that occur in the neck, they are single, and multiple: and they are generated from one another: and every whitlow from them is within its own proper tunic, as is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the species of these whitlows are many.
And from them are stony ones; and from them are those that contain humours; and from them are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that one among them which you see of good disposition to the touch, whose proximity to the skin colour is evident, and which moves to every part, and is not joined to the neck's nerves, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, nor is deep: you should separate it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b, to line, g, and scrape it from every side; and spread the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we said in the case of abscesses of the head, and pull it out gradually.
And it is a precaution that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And let the scalpel not be overly sharp, so that it does not injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and you cut what is not necessary.
However, if you cut a vein or artery, or it hinders you from the operation, then apply pounded zegi to the wound, or certain powders that stop bleeding, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound softens; or it starts and wants to become putrid.
For then the blood stops; therefore return to your operation until you complete it.
Then treat it.
If the entire scab is cut, then you must bring together the two edges of the wound and suture it immediately, after you see that there is no longer any excess.
However, if you see that excess remains because of the size of the scab, then you must strive to cut its root and remove it, and administer the suture which we have described.
And whatever scabs contain moisture, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that the place of its maturity appears to you, and place the puncture from what follows below the body, as we have said.
Then after the puncture, apply liniments with ointment, and similar things, to corrode whatever remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound already cleansed, then treat it with a generative flesh ointment until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients said this incision on the epiglottis, and I have seen no one in our land who has done it, and this is the writing of their speech.
However, in those with synocha, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided, as it does not provide benefit because all the veins and lungs are weak.
However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, the incision of the epiglottis should be used, to avoid the harm that comes from suffocation. Therefore, when we wish to do this, we should cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, making a small incision across, in the area between two circles, an incision that is in the sifac, not in the cartilage. This place is indeed suitable for the incision, because it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the physician is timid, then he should extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Then he should split the skin until he reaches the canal, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any of them.
Then he should cut the sifac we mentioned, and the incision of the canal is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it, with its rupture, and the severing of the voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
When therefore the hour in which suffocation is feared has passed, bring together the two lips of the wound's skin, and sew it itself alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis.
The summary of this account, which we have related, is not applicable unless they see that some of these abscesses have already blocked the patient's throat; and the patient has been raised above death, and his breath is about to cease: they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the patient may breathe over the wound with some respiration and be saved from death.  And on account of this, they prescribed to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is for three days, and as much as it is; then, therefore, they prescribed to sew the wound and to treat it until it is healed.
And that which I saw for myself is that a maid took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut a part of the lung channel with it.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her groaning, like the groan of a dead person.
Therefore, I examined the wound and found a small amount of blood that had come out of the wound.
Therefore, I believed that she had not cut a vein, nor an artery; and wind was coming out of the wound.
I hastened therefore, and treated her wound, until it was healthy; and nothing happened to the maid except hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her former state of health.
Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the incision of the epiglottis.
Concerning the incision of a hernia of the throat.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called a hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
And it is in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental. Certainly, in the natural one there is no ingenuity.
Accidental, however, is in two ways: one of which is similar to fatty tumors.
And the other way is similar to an abscess that forms from the knotting of an artery.
And in it there is fear, and it is not appropriate that presumption be made toward it with iron, unless it is small; and you should test it and investigate it with an instrument.
If, therefore, you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any vein, then cut it, as tumors are cut, and extract it with what contains it from the cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then scrutinize its entire area.
Then treat the area with what is appropriate for treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the incision upon the variety of Tumors.
Chapter XLV. There are many kinds of tumors, and I have already stated all their kinds in the division; and it is necessary for me to relate here the difference between a tumor and a fistula, since it is a cause of doubt. Therefore, I say that when a fistula is present, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the superfluity subsides and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat cease.
However, with a tumor there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains them in a sort of bag or cyst, peculiar to them, and it is according to the color of the body.  And its beginning is like a chickpea, and it grows larger or smaller.
And they are of two kinds: either fatty or containing moisture.
And the colours of moisture are many, as I have said in the division. Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a tumor, you must examine it and investigate it first with an instrument called an Intromissum, according to its form, which will be shown in the chapter after this one.
And the method of investigation of abscesses and all tumors is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most moist place you find in the abscess; and you roll your fingers with it slowly until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Then place your hand at the end according to the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the Intromissum and consider what emerges in its wake.
If therefore a running moisture emerges, whatever colour it may be, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I said in the other abscesses.
And if no moisture emerges in the wake of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty; therefore cut over it with an incision shaped like a cross, according to this form, as I taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and peel the skin from every side with ease; and keep the cyst if you can over it, so that you extract the healthy one with the tumor.
If however the cyst breaks open during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the healthy part, for this often happens, then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
For if a little or much remains of it, the tumor returns for the most part.
If it overcomes you, and a little remains of it: then fill the wound at your completion with certain sharp corrosive powders; and constrict the wound, and place upon it what sits as a warm abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
If therefore the tumor is large, then suture its two lips, and treat it with that which causes it to heal. If however there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein there, then hurry and fill the place with pounded zegi, and leave it constricted for two or three days, until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood ceases; then return to cutting what remains of the tumor.
Concerning the instruments outside for section and perforation.
Chapter XLVI.
Among them are the forms of instruments for insertion, and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
They should be made of iron, with square ends, well-finished, so that they quickly enter the abscess.
And these are forms of instruments, and, no, that is, piercing ones: and one of them is called a beris, that is, a piercer: and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, and openings, and fistulae, and buboes from that which lies between the bones within them.
And others are made round, smooth, and gentle, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, made of gold, or brass, or iron, or silver. And the best of them are those made of gold.
And there are also experiments made from black lead, which are suitable for testing fistulae, whose concavity has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their gentle reflections.
And they are again of three kinds. Because among them are long ones, among them medium ones, and among them short ones, according to the quantity of the fistula's breadth and its constriction. The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds. Because among them are simple ones, namely those which have a single curve: and they are of three kinds, as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And among them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of knives, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: because among them is a large, medium, and small one.
Their cutting edges are sharp, the other edges are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, unless so that they may help in the scraping of knots in fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the sick person may be healed by them, and find a little peace from the burning sensation he finds in scraping an abscess.
These are the large ones, and are of three kinds.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to the instrument with which alcohol is made: and on the broad end a hidden spatula point is placed: and on it runs inward, and outward as you wish, as you see.
The shapes of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers when puncturing abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
They are made of bronze, or brass, round, a little in length, as you see: and let them be of fine workmanship.
And it is necessary that these cupping glasses, large and small, be with you, so that you may cut off blood with speed when needed, and when medicine is not present.
However, do not use them to cut off blood on every part of the body, and use them only on fleshy parts, such as the thighs of the leg, and the hips, and the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groins, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes other small instruments are made from them, similar to hazelnuts, according to their shape, with which blood is cut off when it flows from a phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round in this form.
Concerning the care of men's breasts that resemble women's breasts.
Chapter XLVII.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become swollen at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to become soiled in sleep) until they resemble women's breasts, and remain foul-looking abscesses.
Therefore, whoever abhors that, ought to cut above the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Afterwards, fill the wound with a flesh-forming medicine.
Then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
If, however, the breast inclines downwards and softens because of its size, as happens in women, then it is necessary to cut it in two places on its upper sides with two incisions similar to a crescent shape, each of which is joined to the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards, scrape off the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it is healed.
If, however, you do not complete the incision that you ought to make, because of the patient's distress or because of blood flow, then you ought to fill the wound with a cloth soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess, which occurs under the nipple.
Chapter XLVIII. These abscesses which occur under the nipple are of the nature of hard strophulae, some containing cysts, and some containing moist fluids.
Those of them which contain moist fluids should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut, according to this form, from line b to line g. When thus the entire matter from the abscess is evacuated, then fill it with old linen, and leave it until another day.
Then the linen should be removed, and treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it heals.
If the abscess is of the nature of knotted strophulae, then dissect upon it, as we said in the section on strophulae, equally.
If, however, the wound extends in this so as to emit pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said in what has been stated before.
Of the incision of an abscess that occurs because of the artery and vein.
Chapter XLIX.
When an artery bursts, and the skin over it is consolidated, then often an abscess results from it: and similarly, it also happens to the vein, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to the artery and vein are: because, when the abscess is due to the artery, it is long, gathered deep within the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound to it.
And that which is due to the vein is round on the surface of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and the groin, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is also from them in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Upon that which is from them, from the swelling of the opening of the Artery, find in the skin a cut in length.
Then open the cut with hooks, afterwards the Artery: and free it from its sheaths, until it is exposed.
Then insert a needle beneath it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the Artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two Arteries which are in the temples.
Then puncture the place, which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until the blood which is in it is all discharged, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer a treatment that produces pus, until the ligatures fall off: afterwards treat it with suitable ointments, until it is healed.
If the abscess is because of a cut in a Vein, then you should hold with your hand what you can of the abscess with the skin.
Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate, and have a double thread on it, until you extract it from the other side.
Then tie the abscess with a good ligature; as I told you in the ligature of the grape, from two sides with two ends of the thread. If however you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the needle; press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in the middle of itself, until what is inside it comes out; then cut off the excess skin, and leave what is bound from it.
Then place over it the poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Then administer the treatment, which is done with plasters and ointments, until it is healed.
Concerning the abscess which occurs from the twisting of nerves.
Chapter L.
Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, so too an abscess occurs in the nerves: which occurs in them through a blow, or occurs from excessive exertion, and similar things: and it happens most often in those places of assistance, or the heel, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess. Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is squeezed with force, the infirm person feels a sensation similar to numbness in it.
And it is not a deep-seated abscess within the body, rather it is beneath the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forward, or before, nor backward to the rear.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be treated with iron.
For perhaps a contraction will result.
In that which is in the head or forehead, slit the skin with a lancet.
If it is a small abscess, then hold it with scissors and cut it away from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it: then remove it, and close the wound with sutures: and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the belly.
Chapter LI. Many people frequently have, in their bellies and other parts of their bodies, growths called Fungalia, by resemblance to fungi.
Their root is slender, and their head is thick, and their edges are turned back.
And some of them are small; and some of them greatly enlarge.
And I myself have seen a man in whose belly were two growths, which resembled fungi more than anything else; there was no difference between them—white, small root, and their edges turned back, and they were cleft, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
Therefore I cut them, and found in one the weight of approximately ten and eight ounces, and in the other approximately six ounces.  And the procedure for their incision is, if the patient is damp, and the color of the growth is white, moist, and slender-rooted; then cut it with a broad scalpel, and have cauteries ready in the fire.
For often much blood is expelled at its section; therefore hurry if blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
If you see a patient fearful and timid of incision with iron, then take a well-made lead thread and bind it tightly to the growth;  using the method we described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the lead binding.
Therefore do not cease binding the lead, whenever it presses on the growth, until it is severed, and falls off by itself without effort.
If however the growth is large and rooted, then in its incision there is something of fear and dread, especially that which is in the belly.
However, it is possible to cut it in half.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to cut a growth that is dark in color, of little feeling, and foul in appearance: for it is indeed a cancerous abscess, and I shall come back with a discussion of Cancer after this.
Concerning the treatment of the navel's prominence.
Chapter LII.
The navel's prominence arises from many causes.
Or from fissures of the abdominal wall above, from which wind or intestines escape, as happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood flowing from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned.
Or from constrained wind within it.
If, however, it is due to a fissure of the abdominal wall, and an expulsion of pus, then its color resembles the color of the body, and it is smooth, without pain, and appears in various locations.
And if it is due to the expulsion of an intestine, then its location is, with that which we have described, of a more diverse nature.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it is greatly magnified at the entrance of the bath and with strenuous exertion.
If, however, it is due to moisture, it is smooth, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is it contracted, nor is it added to.
If, however, it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears to be black on the side.
If, however, it is due to generated flesh, then the abscess is serious, large, hard, and fixed according to one amount.
If, however, it is due to windiness, then its touch is smooth. And the operation on it is, that you should consider then, if the eminence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or windiness: then you must abstain from its cure.
For in it is fear and terror, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
If, however, the eminence of the navel is due to the intestine or zirb, then you must instruct the sick person to hold his breath and stand outstretched.
Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Afterwards, instruct him to lie on his back between your hands.
Then surround with a wide spatula the area around the navel, over the spot you marked with ink.
Then extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Then tie him around firmly with thread, or with silk cord, a strong ligament: and let the knot of the ligament be tied tight.
Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligament.
If therefore you find it already grasped by the ligament, then extract the tied part, and introduce the index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly; and if you find the adhesion, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
If however the artery or vein is contrary to you, then surround it greatly.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and introduce into them two strong threads; and introduce the two needles into the circuit you have made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, making them penetrate.
Then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the extended flesh rots; and it falls away by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and rots.
Then treat it with whatever ointment is appropriate, until it heals.
If the prominence of the navel is from flesh protruding in it, or from moisture, then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess, as we said.
And extract the blood, or moisture, that you find in it.
Then treat it with whatever consolidates the place.
Concerning the treatment of CANCER. Chapter LIII.
For I myself could not cure anyone from it, nor did I see anyone before me who had achieved this.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is to proceed and to relieve the weak from black cholera sometimes.
Then phlebotomize it if you find it with manifest fullness.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he is placed with the operation.
Then throw into the Cancer hooks that suit it.
Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to scrutiny, until nothing remains of its roots; and let blood run, and do not sever it quickly, rather squeeze the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instruments are possible there.
If however the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein causes you opposition, then cauterize the vein until the blood is severed.
Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Dropsy.
Chapter LIII.
We have already recounted in the division of the species of dropsy, and how the accumulation of water occurs; and the signs of each species, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites alone; and it is not applied with iron to the species of tympanitis; nor to the species of hyposarca at all; for that is mortal.
When you have already treated this species of tympanitis dropsy with medicines, and your treatment has not been successful, then consider.
For if weakness has already overtaken the sick person, or there is another infirmity with him besides dropsy, such as if there is a cough with him, or looseness of the bowels, and things similar to these: then beware lest you treat him with iron, for there is fear of that.
If, however, you see the sick person of vigorous strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone; and he is neither a child nor an old man; then the method of operation in him is that you raise the sick person standing between your hands, and a servant behind him presses his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a sharp-pointed spatula, according to this form.
Let it be of two sharp parts, long, and sharp at the extremity like a spatula.
However, let there be something of shortness in it gradually, so that you do not proceed with it in the operation all the way to the intestines, and harm him.
Then consider.
For if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend the incision from the navel a distance of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubic bone.
If however the generation of dropsy is because of disease of the liver, then let your incision be on the left side from the navel three fingers.
And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Then pierce the whole skin with an instrument.
Then introduce it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and if you do, as if you were to scrape it; and let the amount scraped off be the quantity of a fingernail, or about that.
Then pierce, if so, until the spatula reaches the empty space; and it is the space of water.
Then extract it, and introduce into the hole the instrument, which has this shape.
And it is similar to a cannula; it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished; to which at its lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side; and the end of it is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see; on its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it itself descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a medium quantity.
Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour through the dissolution of his animal spirit; or a syncope occurs to him which is near death.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the sick person signify to you, from the virtue of his pulse, and from his good condition.
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
Which is, because it is retained immediately on account of the skin that retains the opening which is over the sifac: of which I spoke, that you should pierce it according to that method.
Then again insert the instrument on the second day, if you see the sick person tolerating it; and also extract a small quantity from the water. Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until there remains little of the water.
However, if you fear for the sick person, and you remove much from the water, then care for him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and the sun, and let him endure thirst; and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed; and cauterize above the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water, according to what I said in what preceded.
Concerning the care of infants who are born in places where their urinary openings are not perforated.
Chapter LV. When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its urethra is not perforated, or is a narrow opening, or is in the wrong place.
Therefore, it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when it is born, with a very fine Spatumili, according to this form.
Then place a fine leaden nail in the opening, and tie it; and hold it for three days, or four.
When, therefore, it wishes to urinate, it is removed, and it urinates.
Then replace it.
And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.
However, he whose opening is constricted is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is widened.
However, those in whom the opening is in the wrong place are harmed.
This is because, in those who are born with it, the opening is at the end of the penis: therefore, they cannot urinate forward until they raise the penis with their hand to the higher place. Nor is there generation for him, because the semen cannot reach the womb properly: and it is a very foul illness.
And the method of operation in him is that the sick man be placed on his back.
Then extend his penis with your left hand by forceful extension, and cut off the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a pointed knife, or a sharp scalpel; as is the incision of a reed, or as you shave something, so that the middle of it comes to be similar to the head of the penis, and so that the opening falls in the middle as it should.
And beware of the flow of blood in your operation.
For it often happens.
Therefore, apply to it whatever stops the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Concerning what happens in the foreskin and the head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter LVI.
These affections of the penis often occur, and there is a prominence of foul flesh.
And from it, one is malignant and another is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook and cut off, until you cleanse the whole thing.
Then place upon it a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterwards with the unguent diafinicon, until it heals.
If it is malignant, of foul colour, then you should apply a cautery to it after incising and scraping it.
If, however, the Albather is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and part of it is inside the foreskin and part outside, then it is necessary to remove the Albather that is inside first, until it is consolidated, then treat the outside part; for when you treat them together, the foreskin is not safe from being pierced.
And they also occur in the testicles, and in the foreskin, blackness and corruption.
Therefore, you must cauterize all that is already blackened and that is about to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Then apply over it afterwards with honey that has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark and crushed and sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
If however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For cautery is helpful for two conditions simultaneously, namely for the flow of blood, and a wound when it is corrupted.
If the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra so that the patient can urinate over it.
However, in the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur unless the foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon it; and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess: therefore, it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
If it is difficult to discern these things precisely, then it is necessary to scrape off something from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
Because when the foreskin is thin, it is perhaps perforated quickly due to its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine until it is consolidated. Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Chapter LVII.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is proper to children, it is necessary that we mark it with a better operation, and a smoother path leading to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experiment.
This is because I have found the majority of craftsmen and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and scissors, and using leeches and ligating with thread and incision with a nail.
And I myself have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing than with scissors and ligation with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers, perhaps the upper layer is cut, and the lower layer remains; therefore, it is necessary to make an incision to cut the other, and future pain will result.
And with cleansing done by leeches, that is, digital, which the sewers use, the incision of the male member's extremity is not secured; because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron slips out and ruins your operation: and indeed the skin of a boy is of short nature, and often they are born in such a way that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen that.
However, cleansing with shears, and tying with thread, has shown me a good test; because shears are proportional to the incision; because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a compression is made in a similar figure, encompassing the skin of the penis on all sides, with which error does not occur at all.
And the proper method of the operation is, that you cause the boy, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, to realize that you do not do anything except tie a thread to his penis, and you leave him until another day.
Then cause him to rejoice and be glad in every way possible to you, from that which his understanding receives.
Then insert your hand into his penis, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it of the impurities that collect upon it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Afterwards, tie a second ligature a little lower. Then hold the lower ligature site with your index finger and thumb, with good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Then lift the skin quickly upward and pull out the rod's head.
Then allow the blood to run slowly (for it is better) and place powder on top.  And over the powder, a cloth on which is spread the yolk of a boiled egg in rosewater, mixed with good fresh rose oil.  And leave it on top until another day.  And treat it with the remaining treatment until healed.
The form of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Let the two ends be blunt and meeting, so that the nail's branch does not come out of them; and let the length of the two sharp points be equal to the length of the two handles.
An error, however, occurring in cleansing is: perhaps the inner skin is entirely or partially escaped at the incision. Therefore, you should stretch it from your hour with your fingernail before the abscess of the place, and cut it according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with a hook and cut it.
However, if three days have passed, and that which is under the rod remains swollen, abscessed: then leave it until the abscess subsides, and carefully remove it, and cut it according to what is prepared for you; and beware of the head of the rod.
For that will not harm it.
Therefore, treat it with that which consolidates a wound from the powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders; and if it is cut from the skin beyond measure, and extends to the upper parts, that will not harm it either.
Therefore, treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Chapter LVIII.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or formed flesh, and similar things to those which we have mentioned from the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not discharged, and you see that its retention is due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary for him to be weak, bent over his knees.
Then let his feet be placed on his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the weak person restrain his breath as much as possible.
Thus, he is forced, with the neck of the bladder, towards the expulsion of the stone to the rear, wherefore the urine is released.
If it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe on the sick person, then it is necessary for you to administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave, like the quill of a bird's feather in slenderness, long in the likeness of one and a half palms; to which let there be a slender tube at its head.
And the method of the urine's exit through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie to its extremity wool, or tow, a good ligature; and introduce the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the Syringe; and cut with shears if any excess of wool remains, but introduce it into the tube with force, as a lever.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg; and make the sick person sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and its member with moist oils, and olive oil, and tepid water.
Then introduce the syringe into the member with ease, until it reaches the root of the member.
Then double it upwards from the navel. Then propel the syringe within it, until it reaches the Bladder, and the sick person feels it has already arrived at the empty thing: and this is not done according to this order, except because the passage, in which it goes, is tortuous.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
For urine will follow the wool.
Then pull it out, and cause the urine to run through the urinary pathway: and again syringe, and do not cease to do that, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief. Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
It is indeed deaf, that is, closed.
And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
And the concave place, in which that which propels it is situated, should be according to the amount that is sufficient for it without addition, until, when something is pulled with it, moisture is drawn out; and when it is propelled, it is expelled far away, in accordance with how the clepsydra throws naphtha, that is, Greek fire in naval battles.
Therefore, when the force is to project the moisture into the bladder, introduce the extremity of the clepsydra into the moisture, and pull with that which propels it upwards, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then introduce its extremity into the tube, as we described in the syringe.
Then propel the moisture with that which propels it; for that moisture will reach the bladder at once, so that the sick person feels it. A subtle form of clyster for injecting into the bladder.
Then introduce a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve. Then assemble the circle, as an alembic is assembled; after you have placed in it what you want of moistures, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Concerning the extraction of the Stone.
Chapter LX. We have already spoken in the division of the species of Stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have explained the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of each; and I have spoken of the stone in which manual operation and incision are necessary; and this is the stone that is properly generated in the bladder; and that which adheres to the urethra; and I am narrating this with clear explanation and brevity.
Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in children.
And among its signs is that the urine issues from the bladder like water in its fineness; and white sand appears in it, and the sick person rubs his urethra and suffers with it, and often hangs [himself] down. Then it rises and the anus protrudes in many of them.
And the cure is easy in children, as long as they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in the elderly.
But in young people it is intermediate, in that which is between those [two]; and that of whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if small, the cure is the opposite of that.
Therefore, when we come to the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will expel all the stool that is in their intestines; for it sometimes hinders the finding of the stone in the examination. Then let the sick person be taken with their feet, and shaken, and moved downwards, so that the stone may descend to the depth of the bladder, or leap out of a high place sometimes.
Then have him sit between your hands, prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the whole bladder may be sloping downwards.
Then examine him and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then quickly proceed with incision upon it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to wipe your index finger with the oil of your left hand, if the patient is a boy; or the middle finger if he is a full-grown youth; and to insert it into his anus, and search for the stone until it is beneath your finger; and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards against the place whose incision you desire; and command a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another servant to raise the testicles with his right hand upwards; and with his other hand, to draw back the skin which is beneath the testicles, in the part adjacent to the place where the incision is.
Then insert the Spatumile, making an incision, whose shape is this.
And make an incision in the area between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left flank; and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, according to the amount that it is possible for the stone to exit through it not larger.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone near the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
And know that if the stone has angles and edges, its exit becomes difficult because of that.
And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round, its exit becomes easy.
Therefore, to the one that has angles and edges, add in the fissure.
If it does not emerge thus, then it is necessary to devise something over it: either to string it over it with a carefully made instrument, whose tip is like the Moon, which strings over the stone and does not escape from it; or to introduce under it a subtle instrument with a curved tip.
If, however, you cannot over it, then enlarge the opening a little.
If, however, anything from the blood overcomes you, cut it off with a zegi.
If, however, there is more than one stone, then drive the largest first into the bladder opening.
Then cut over it.
Afterwards, push the smaller one after that; and similarly do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut over it with a large incision.
For since it happens to the patient one of two things, either that he dies, or that a constant dripping of urine occurs to him; because the place is not completely consolidated.
But administer its expulsion, until it emerges; or skillfully break it with scissors, until you extract it piece by piece.
When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: that a hot abscess might settle.
Then lay the sick person on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When you have therefore loosened it, embrocate the place with water and plenty of oil.
Then treat it with diafhinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
If however in the wound a hot abscess has been added, and corrosive things, and similar things: such as if the blood should congeal in the bladder, and the urine should be prohibited from it; and it is recognized by the issue of blood with urine.
Therefore introduce your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply whatever is suitable for treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the hours of the entire treatment, that you bind the two hips, and gather, for the reason of the medicines which are placed upon the place.
If a small stone is in the urethra, and is fixed in it, and the exit of urine is hindered, then treat it with what I described previously before you reach the stage of incision.
For very often you will be spared incision through this treatment, for I have already proven it. And it is so that you take a perforator of iron, whose form is this, a triangular tip, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take thread, and tie the urethra with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the piercing iron into the urethra with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
For then urine is immediately discharged.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the urethra.
For it will break, and exit with the urine, and the sick person will be healed.
If however this treatment is not prepared for you, due to something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone in the urethra itself between the two ligatures.
Then extract it.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
And a ligature of thread beneath the stone is not necessary, unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and another ligature above it, unless so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's expulsion, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.  And for that reason, it is necessary for you, when you tie the upper thread, to lift the skin upwards, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we have said.
Concerning the extraction of a stone in women.
Chapter LXI.
Little stone is generated in women.
However, if a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is prohibited due to many methods.
One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin. And the second is, because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or having husbands.
The third is, because you do not find a woman well-knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the stone's location: wherefore it needs deep incision, and in that is fear.
If necessity provokes it, then it is necessary that you take a woman physician, well-knowing: and little is found.
If truly you keep her private, then seek a chaste, subtle physician, and present a woman midwife well-taught in the matter of women, or a woman who indicates a part of the art in this skill: make her therefore present, and especially to her, that she do all that you command her from the inquiry about the stone. First, that she look to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert her finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
If, therefore, she finds it, she should constrict it under her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina of the sick woman, and inquire about the stone, after placing her left hand upon the bladder, and compressing it with a good compression. If, therefore, she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength, until she reaches it with the root of the thigh.
Then she should cut upon it at the opposing midpoint of the vulva, at the root of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, constricting it underneath: and let the incision be small at first.
Then insert a rod over that incision.
If, therefore, she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone emerges from it.
And know that the types of stone are many. For among these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Know therefore its types, so that this may signify to you concerning that which you desire.
If, therefore, blood conquers you, then add to the place ground zegi, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is cut off.
If, however, a flow of blood conquers you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut: then put powder upon the place, and bind it with bandages fittingly tight: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
When, therefore, the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
On the sectioning of a watery hernia.
Chapter LXII.
A watery hernia is not present unless there is an aggregation of moisture in a white sifac, which is beneath the skin containing the testicle and egg; and it is called a sifac. And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature prepared for it in part of the egg, until it becomes rotten; which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we said: and that does not occur except rarely.
And indeed the generation of this hernia is from weakness that occurs in the testicles; wherefore this matter is discharged to them.
And sometimes it occurs from a blow upon the testicles.
And this moisture has many colours. For either its colour inclines to yellowness, or it is blood-red, or foul, black, or watery white, and there is that which is more.
For if it is in the white sifac that we have mentioned, then the abscess is round to a small length like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture surrounds it on every side.
And if the moisture is in the proper pannicle to itself, then the abscess is round with a portion of an egg, and on account of this a man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the senses.
Therefore, when you want knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, the form of which preceded.
Therefore, according to that which emerges in the trace of the Intromission, judge of that which is between it.
Therefore, when we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person that he be bled if it is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then he will be laid upon his back upon a slightly elevated object, and place many cloths beneath him.
Then sit you on his left, and instruct the minister to sit on his right, who will extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel of the belly.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, up to near the pubis; and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac encompassing it; and scrape it and observe, or beware from this, that you dissect it; and let your scraping, with which you scrape it, be from the part that hangs more with the egg; and subtly examine it with the scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then pierce the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water. Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and stretch the sifac upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles encompassing it; and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either with its totality, or in fragments, especially its thin side.
For if you do not diligently examine it, security is not achieved in its incision, lest the water return.
If, however, the egg proceeds outward from its skin during the time of your operation: then, when you have completed the incision of the sifac, return it.
Then gather the two lips of the skin of the testicles with sutures.
Then treat it as the other wounds until it heals.
If you find a corrupted egg by reason of another blackness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels, which are the suspensories, fearing the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory, and remove the egg; afterwards treat it with what we have said.
If, however, water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches; therefore cut the other part in the same manner as you did the other, equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do it; afterwards wipe away the blood.
And introduce into the sections wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the middle of the belly; and place over that folded cloths, and they are cushions; and tie them over with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness; and make the ends with which it is pressed of cotton, or damp wool; and let them be gathered with a constriction at the lumbar part of the breeches; and one end take over the anus up to the back, and the second take to the part of the pubic bone; and two ends over the two thighs below, and two other ends over the two groins, and the whole constriction be gathered at the lumbar part of the breeches.
And, sometimes, this branch is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of the incision with iron; and it is that you take a fine, knife-like cautery and cut with it the skin of the testicles; and it is heated, according to what we have described; until, when a white substance containing water is revealed, then take the cautery, according to this form.
It resembles the Greek letter.
Then pierce it with it, and it is heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Then extend the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated fine cautery, and cut it as much as possible, until you eradicate the whole of it.
And beware of the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than an operation with a cut.
If, however, opposition occurs to you during the hour of the incision, or during the hour of the cautery, a hot abscess, or blood flow, or something else: then it is necessary to treat that which causes opposition to you from it with the cure that suits it, as has been stated.
If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect this operation, because of its horror: then administer a perforation, as I describe it: and it is.
When it is certified to you by what we have said about signs that the limb is watery, then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula: and place the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place a poultice over the affected area, and bandage it, and allow it to drain the remaining water; then treat it, until the wound is healed.
If, however, there is resistance to the egress of water at the time you pierce it: and this is only because a white membrane causes resistance in the wound opening and prevents the escape of water: then it is necessary that you insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of hydrops is extracted, whose form preceded: or add to the operation of the wound for a short time.
And know that water returns and collects after six months, or about that time.
When it collects, then it should be pierced according to the same method, and the sick person will pass their days.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the section above this tumor, there is fear leading to harm in many dispositions.
Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal is better than that.
And I am recalling the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Therefore, I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and that is made from many causes, namely. Or from acute or acrid superfluity, which is poured out to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and it is a severe abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it arises from the knotting of arteries and their inflation, as its prior mention has already shown, or from the inflation of veins.
Therefore, that which arises from the inflation of arteries is recognized by the disposition of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
And you need not touch it entirely.
But that which arises from the inflation of veins does not disperse anything from it upon compression with the fingers. And now it is possible that a section be made upon this type, and upon the remaining flesh: and it is, as if you separate the skin of the testicles.
Then extend the egg upward, and extract it with a white sifach: and free the suspensory from the vessels, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from all parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary to pull the egg, and cut it. And if there is an adhesion between some siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary to free all that adhesion, and cut it with a round incision.
If however there is a nativity of flesh in the place of adhesion that is behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we said. When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
On the treatment of Ramicis, which is with Vite.
Chapter LXIV.
Vitis is an abscess enveloped by a certain covering, similar to a bunch of grapes, with a softening of the testicles; and it makes difficult for the infirm movement and exercise, and walking.
And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded it being remembered.
But it is necessary, that we say, the operation in it according to what the first ones did. I say therefore, that it is necessary that you make the infirm person sit on a raised seat.
Then cut with a broad, sharp spatule in a transverse section directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then scrape away from every side, as we said to you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Then cut them in the middle, in a straight section along the length of the body, and extract that which is collected from corrupt, foul humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which the force generates pus, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle may fall.
For there is no harm through it.
However, if it happens to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted with the vessels, so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment due to the incision and decays or dries up, and there is no benefit with them.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal worms. Chapter LXV.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
And this rupture is either from a sifach, or an extension of it.
And these two types happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a cry, or lifting a heavy object, and similar things.
And a sign, when it is from the extension of sifach.
It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal to the depth: because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And a sign of it when it is from a section of sifach, because it causes a severe pain to occur suddenly at its beginning: and it is a different abscess, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
And sometimes it emerges with the intestine as a zirbum: and this is called a Ramix intestinalis, and zirbia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes faeces run into the intestine, and are retained there: and there is harm with it for the sick person: because it causes a mild pain, and especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of these types of illness, there is fear with iron; therefore, it is necessary to avoid such an event.
And the method of operation is that you should instruct the sick person to draw back the intestine with his own hand to the inner cavity of his body, if it yields to being pulled back.
Then he should be laid back on his neck between your hands, and his legs raised.
Then stretch the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles completely lengthwise.
Then place hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them, and let the incision be according to the amount that is possible, so that the egg may emerge from it.
Then scrape away the siphak and whatever is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is uncovered on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and detach with it the adhesion which is on the posterior part of the egg.
Then move with your right hand the skin of the testicles inwards; and with this, stretch the white siphak upwards with your left hand, and lift the egg with the siphak towards the incision; and command the servant to stretch the egg upwards, and you detach the adhesion, which is behind the complete separation.
And search with your fingers to see that there is nothing there of the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak.
If, however, you find anything from it, then push it towards the lower abdomen.
Then take a needle, on which is thick thread, made of linen from ten threads, and insert it at the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles that follows the incision; then cut the ends which protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Then arrange some of them over some with a figure which is in the manner of a cross; and tie them with the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is beneath the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until no vessel, which nourishes them, can send anything to them: so that no hot abscess may occur from this.
And place again a ligature second, outside the first ligature, distant from it by less than two fingers.
And after these two ligatures, leave from the siphak, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger; and cut the rest entirely around, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles the incision, from which runs blood and pus, as we have narrated in that which is said before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound; and apply the ligature that we have narrated.
And sometimes the white sifach that we spoke of is cauterized, after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
For this often happens.
And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
If, however, its falling is delayed, then it should be moistened with hot water; and place upon it that which we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
Concerning the windy (or:  windy-disease) ram.
Chapter LXVI.
In this ram disease, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron in its treatment.
And indeed the first ones said that it occurs as we have described in the ram disease that is with the vine.
That is, tie the vessels after the incision over them easily from below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat with whatever opens it, until the vessels fall away; and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.
Concerning the rupture that occurs in the inguinal region.
Chapter LXVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends into the scrotum: and if something does descend, it is little, and returns every hour: but if the time passes with this, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
And that happens from the stretching of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we said.
This is because the sifach stretches; then the area softens, and the place becomes suppurated, and protrudes.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its previous description stated.
And sometimes it is treated with iron, according to this method: and it is that the sick person lie on their back between your hands.
Then cut the suppurated and protruding place of the rupture, cutting across the width, according to the amount of three fingers.
Then draw tight the alsifak and what is under the skin, until the white sifach is revealed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Then take a rod, and place it on the protruding place of the sifach, and press it into the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two protruding places on the end of the rod from the sifach, and connect one of them to the other with a suture; then pull out the end of the rod.
And do not cut the alsifach entirely, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of the intestinal ramicis. Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
For the sisach contracts, and does not add to the prominence of the rupture.
And the cautery is better in this place, because it is nearer to health.
On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, because of which the flesh between them is softened, and its appearance is marred.
Therefore, it is necessary for him who is asked to treat it, that he make the sick man lie on his back, and cut all the softened skin over the natural skin. Then, he shall bring together the two folds with sutures: and if he wishes, he shall first suture the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and make the sutures firm.
Then, treat the treatment of the remaining wounds, until it is healed and the threads fall out.
Concerning Castration.
Chapter LXIX.
Know that castration is excommunicated in our law, and because of that it would be permissible for me not to recall it in this book of mine; and its mention is not necessary except for two ways.
One of which is that it should be in the physician's knowledge when questioned about it, and so that he may know its treatment for the one who has suffered it.
And another way is that we frequently require the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
Therefore, I say that castration is done according to two methods. Or by attrition.
Or by fissure and section.
In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water, until its testicles are softened and relaxed and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are dissolved and do not appear under the touch.
In castration by fissure and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of Hermaphrodites, there are two methods.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite is from men in two ways.
One of them is because a space appears in it, or in the skin of the testicles, in the area between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine runs from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one species, and it is a woman's vulva above the pubis, like very small male testicles, protruding outward; of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of three species, two from men, and one species from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until the impression of them is gone.
Then treat them with the treatment of the remaining wounds.
In the second species of men, from which urine emerges, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any cure for it at all.
Concerning the incision of the Tentigo, and the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo perhaps grows over the natural state, until its appearance becomes unsightly and foul: and sometimes in some women it magnifies so much, until it expands like in men, and reaches the point of intercourse.
Therefore, you should hold the excess Tentigo with your hand or a hook, and cut it; and do not stop cutting, especially at the deep root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment for wounds until it heals.
However, the flesh that arises is flesh that grows in the orifice of the womb until it fills it: and perhaps it emerges to the exterior in the likeness of a tail; and because of this some earlier writers call this illness "tailed disease.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it like we cut Tentigo, and to treat it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is the unpierced vulva of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, that the vulva of a woman is not perforated, or the opening is small.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is it from an illness that preceded it: and indeed it is made either from added born flesh, or from thin or thick syrphach: and it is made either in the deep of the matrix, or in its sides, or in its upper or lower part: and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
And its knowledge is made through the observation of the midwife, if an apparent blockage is nearby.
If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
If however the blockage is from thin syrphach, and is near the two lips: then hurry, and break it.
And it is, that you place cushions on the two lips.
Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs outstretched.
Then spread the two lips with strength, until the thin syrphach is broken, and the blockage is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it over the place: and let the woman apply it daily, so that the place will not consolidate again.
If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a spatula broad like a myrtle leaf.
If however the blockage is of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that curb the flow of blood without causing a bite, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for a few days: and administer lint made from dried linen, then treat the remainder with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And sometimes a birth of other flesh grows in the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be cut according to this method, as long as it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess that is in the womb, no opposition should be made with iron at all.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red Bothor in women's vulvas.
Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the veins' orifices, until much blood flows from them continuously.
When hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil; and I have already stated in the division of their species and their signs; and I shall say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no treatment with iron for them.
However, those of them which are in the orifice of the womb over which sensation falls, are those which are treated.
Therefore it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cold house.
Then extend the thelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then powder over them at the flow of blood from one of the powdered incisions without mastication: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and things similar to them.
Then let him drive her feet to the wall for one hour.
Afterwards, lay her down in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and quince bark, and galls, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
If, therefore, blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, make cupping vessels adhere to the back and under the breasts, without incision.
Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnogloss, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, or Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the wound.
When, therefore, the abscess rests, then treat the place with ointments, until it is healed.
Albarth, however, is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary that you cut what appears from it, according to what I said about the thelil equally: and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of the passage that occurs in the womb.
Chapter LXXIV.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and inflamed swellings, and alekilati, that is, herpes, erysipelas, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
And indeed I have already mentioned all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses that collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with iron.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider.
Then, if the pain of the abscess in its inception is acute with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it red: if feeling falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with that which aids in maturation, until when the acuteness of the occurrences subsides.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that slopes down two seats, and that she reclines, or is supported on her back, and that she draws her feet to the lower part of her belly: and that her thighs be spread open, and that she place her arms under her knees, and that she bind each with a suitable bandage to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Whose form comes in those that are after.
And it is necessary, when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix it with the rod deep in the woman's womb, so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb and harms the weak.
However, if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions over the depth of the womb: so that the entrance of the entire instrument into the womb's depth is prevented: and it is necessary that it place the pivot, which runs along the instrument, from the upper side; and that it hold the instrument, and that the attendant turn the pivot, until the depth of the womb is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by the hand, and is smooth and soft, then it is necessary that you separate it at its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and place the cloth, and extract the section within the depth of the womb.
And place externally on the womb, and upon the vulva, clean wool soaked in water, in which mallows have been boiled.
Then treat it after two days with an ointment suitable for it, until it heals.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is injected with water and honey; then with water in which the lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden internally within the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron; rather, treat it with what we said in the division.
Doctrines of Midwives, how living embryos are treated, having emerged in a non-natural form.
Chapter LXX.
It is necessary for the midwife to know first the form of natural birth.
Therefore, among its signs is this: when you see a woman pressing downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and she is relieved of what is upon her from the birth, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is upon her head, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel. Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her abdomen be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
However, any birth other than this one is unnatural, blameworthy.
For sometimes the fetus emerges on its feet, and its body emerges before its head and its feet, and its hand or foot alone; or its head and hand emerge; or the belly emerges; and perhaps it turns on its neck, and similar forms are blameworthy.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception; and I am showing every form of them, and how the nature of it is, and how it is to be signified and to stand over it.
When the fetus emerges on its head in its natural emergence, and it becomes violent upon the woman, and her labor becomes difficult, and you see her strength already weakened, then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her; and apply vapors to her vulva with decoction of fenugreek and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and with it split the afterbirth, and cut it with her fingernail until that which is in it from moisture runs out; and press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman must be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then command her, after the enema, to compress herself; and make her sneeze with seasonings, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
The fetus will emerge immediately.
If the fetus's two hands emerge first, it is necessary to gently and gradually draw them back.
If, however, it does not yield on entry, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet up; then shake the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If, therefore, the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remaining fetus; and bind its hand with cloth, and extract it with evenness; for it will emerge.
The exit of the embryo is above its feet.
When the fetus emerges above its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards, straighten it.
Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When, therefore, they emerge up to the hips, then command him to be compressed, and make him sneeze with condiments; for it will emerge, if God wills.
And if it does not emerge with what we have recounted, then return the fetus gradually, until you place it in its natural form.
For it will then emerge with ease.
If it is prevented with all that we have recounted, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound all in a mortar with good pounding: then line with it the woman's vulva and the lower part of her abdomen.
Then make her sit in lukewarm water, until she achieves hypocundria.
When therefore you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her a poultice of myrrh and apply it.
When therefore the poultice has held for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Then make her sneeze: and bind her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle pressure.
For the fever will depart immediately.
The birth of the fetus is on the knees and hands.
When it emerges in this manner, then gently insert her hands.
Then the woman should lie on her back, with her feet hanging down: and she should lie on the bed, and fold her hands.
Then press gently on her abdomen.
Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows, until it is prepared at the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a forceful motion.
Then press gently on what is above the hypochondria, until the fetus ascends to the upper part.
Then let her introduce her hands, and gently adjust the fetus: and order the woman to compress, until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Let his hand be inserted in the reduction.
If however he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman, and make her walk.
If however she cannot walk, then make her lie down on a bed: and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.
If, however, childbirth takes it, then make her sit on a seat.
Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and bring the fetus back to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and order her to press herself, until it emerges.
The exit of the fetus is upon her neck, with hands outstretched, and its face towards her mother's back.
The midwife ought to hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it over, and bring it into alignment with ease.
When, therefore, it is aligned, then place upon her vulva that which we have described from oil and mucilages.
Then order her to move gradually.
When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and order her to lean to her right side.
Then order her to press [herself] and make her sneeze with a condiment.
The exit of the prepared fetus on its side.
When it descends to the opening of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is evacuated from moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel, so that it is not retained, and dies.
Then push the fetus inward until you place it as it should be, and order the woman to press herself several times; for it will emerge through a light exit.
The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born.
However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
However, five is a thing outside nature, and they do not live at all; and one afterbirth contains them, however numerous, and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing between them, tied to the navel of each of them.
And sometimes they emerge as a single fetus emerges by a natural, easy exit, and they emerge with an ignominious exit, as we have narrated. If some of them are difficult at birth, and reach the condition we have described from unnatural figures, then treat them as we have narrated; and let the midwife be skillful, and let her do what she does with ease and deliberation, and let her devise according to every form with what is prepared for her from ingenuity leading to health.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has been verified with me that a woman, when she miscarried, expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
That which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Therefore, this entire matter must be within the knowledge of the Midwife. For perhaps it will come to her similar to that; therefore, let her oppose it with that which is appropriate.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division of medications, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use an operation with the hand, then you must consider.
If therefore the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted by any of the accidents from which harm is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid supine on a bed, on her back, and her head be lowered, and her legs raised; and the attendant shall hold her from two sides, or she shall be bound to the bed, so that her body is not disturbed during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with humid oils with the mucilage of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and linseed. Then the midwife shall anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages, then shall introduce it into the womb with ease.
Then she shall seek with it the place where she shall fix the hooks on the fetus, and the places suitable for that.
Therefore consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in the places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
If however the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubis and middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand, and place its curvature in that which is between the fingers of her left hand, and introduce it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not only be straight, but rather move in every direction, so that its exit may be eased; as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary that the extension be softened in that which is between them.
If a part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them from the side, so that she may turn with them that which is retained.
If, therefore, a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks should be moved to another, higher place; do this until the entire fetus emerges.
If, therefore, a hand emerges before the other parts, and it is not possible to return it, because of its constriction, then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it.
Then draw it out until, when the whole emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow; and thus it is necessary that you do in the other hand and in the two feet.
If, however, the fetus's head is large, or constriction occurs in its exit, or water is gathered in its head, then it is necessary that they insert a thorny Spatumile between the fingers, and split the head with it, and extract the water; or break it with the instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
Similarly, if the fetus has a naturally large head, then it is necessary to cut away the obstructing parts; or extract it with misdach, as we have said.
Then pull out the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges and is constricted at the fork, then it should be split until the moisture in the chest is discharged.
If however it is not tangled, nor yields to the exit, then cut the head into pieces, according as is possible for you.
If the lower part of the abdomen has an abscess, or has dropsy in it, then it is necessary to pierce it until moisture flows from it.
If the fetus is positioned above its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the opening of the womb is gentle.
If, however, it is constricted at the abdomen or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand, and split the abdomen or chest until that which is in them flows out.
If the other limbs are removed, and the head returns, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If, therefore, the opening of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the womb, and search with it for the head, and pull it with her fingers up to the opening of the womb; then she should insert one hook, or two hooks, into it, and pull it with that.
If, however, the opening of the womb is constricted, due to a hot abscess that has occurred in it, then it is not necessary to exert effort on it, rather it is necessary to administer the outflow of humid, oily things, and apply plasters, and she should sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to equalize it; then administer what we have said about a living fetus.
If that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that you not leave any part of the afterbirth inside at all.
When you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about hot abscesses that occur in the wombs.
If a flow of blood occurs, then it should be placed in styptic waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
And I myself have already seen a woman, in whose belly a dead fetus was: then she became pregnant again over it, afterwards another fetus died as well.
Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it became swollen until it opened, and began to discharge pus.
I was therefore called to treat her, and I medicated her for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Therefore, I placed upon it some strong-drawing plasters, and bone came out from the place.
Then a few days passed, and another bone came out.
I was therefore amazed by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
I therefore thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
I therefore investigated the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in her better dispositions: and she has now lived thus for a long time, and a little pus comes out from the place.
And I would not have affirmed this extraneous thing, unless there is knowledge and assistance in it, which the skilled physician administers with the hand from the cure.
Concerning the forms of necessary instruments in the extraction of a fetus.
Chapter LXXVII.
Here below is the form of a Straighter, by which books are made equal, which equally has two turns at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
However, this turn must be finer than the straighter; and to make it, either from ebony or from boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood is about two fingers; and the margin of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are now fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the opening of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two turns.
The form of the turn by which the matrix is opened.
Another form similar to it, finer and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
However, at its extremity there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
When therefore you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, opening what is between her legs.
Then introduce these two joined additions into the matrix: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wishes.
Another form of Vertigo, which the ancients called the Form of the Impeller, by which the fetus is impelled.
The Almisdac form by which the small head is crushed. The form of a hook with a single spine.
The form of a hook with two spines.
The form of tongs with saw teeth, with which the fetus's head is crushed.
The form of a scalpel with two ends for severing the head.
The form of two broad scalpels.
All these instruments are used, and the more their types are multiplied, and they are prepared by the craftsman, the quicker he is at his work, and the higher he is esteemed among people, because of their quantity.
Therefore, do not despise any instrument of them, lest it be not prepared for you.
For their necessity is inexcusable.
Concerning the extraction of the Secundine.
Chapter LXXVIII.
When the Secundine is retained at childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with condiments: and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils.
If therefore it emerges by this, it is good.
If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid: and place in it herbs that open the mother's mouth, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, seham, cinnamon, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them over the fire.
Then place a reed plug over the hole of the pot's lid, and the other end in the woman's womb: and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said.
For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
However, if it remains after this treatment, and does not emerge, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage. Then let her introduce it into the vagina, and seek out the afterbirth with it.
When therefore she finds it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
However, if it is attached deep within the womb, then let her introduce her hand, as we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and draw it out gradually in a straight line, so that the womb does not fall during a forceful pulling: indeed, it is necessary that it is moved with ease to the right and left sides, and then the pulling force should be increased.
For it will then yield, and be preserved, and escape from the adhesion.
If the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with medication from a pot with herbs.
If, however, it does not emerge with all that we have described, then beware of tiring yourself out in repeated attempts at extraction.
But it is necessary that whatever emerges from it to the mouth of the womb be tied to the woman's hip.
Then inject her with a clyster of tetrapharmacon ointment.
For this will cause it to putrefy after days, and it will dissolve, and emerge.
However, when it putrefies, an evil odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and injures the weak one.
Therefore, appropriate fumigations should be administered to it.
Some of the ancients have already experienced fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates a woman in the retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Let it be made of glass similar to a lamp, or of earthenware: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and the fumigation be placed over the embers: let her hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and again another.
Concerning the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Chapter LXXIX.
Many children are born with their anuses unperforated, which the subtle sifac has already obstructed.
Therefore, the midwife should pierce that sifac with her finger; and if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula, and be cautious not to injure the surrounding tissue.
Then place upon it wool steeped in wine and oil.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to defecate.
And obstruction of the anus also happens from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut that consolidation, then treat it with what we said concerning treatment and lead. Concerning the treatment of Fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Chapter LXXX.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodules and swellings that occur near the anus externally, or in the space of one part: and it is one fistula, or several.
When that nodule ages, it opens, and watery white moisture, or thin pus, runs from it.
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
And some of them are fistulas when they are in the space penetrating up to the bladder and up to the urethra.
And some of them are penetrating up to the hip joint and up to the tailbone.
By this, a penetrating fistula up to the anus is known, even from a non-penetrating one, that you insert your index finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe into the fistula from air or iron, when there is no twisting.
If there is twisting in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe, or a hair from a horse's mane, until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything emerge from the opening with excretion, nor wind, nor worms as I said, then know that it is non-penetrating: therefore hasten to the cure.
And when the fistula is penetrating up to the bladder, or to the urinary meatus, then its indication is the excretion of urine from it, and the prohibition of it from this so that the place may be consolidated with medicines.
If however it is penetrating up to the hip joint, or to the hip bone, then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twisting in it up to the bone, and the finding of pain around the part, and that pus emerges from it always, and that treatment in it does not work, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all: and their treatment is labor and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed. However, in that which is not penetrating and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I tell you, and I have already proved: and it is that the sick person should lie between your hands on their back, and raise their legs above their hips, and their hips should be inclined towards their belly.
Then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
If, however, the sick person feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If, therefore, you feel the probe in your finger having already penetrated itself detected, besides what you feel between your finger and the fistula, or flesh: then you know for certain that it is penetrating: therefore, do not work on it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
They have said, however, that in some people the flesh is healed, and that through medication of which benefit is hoped for, it is to apply a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and to insert it heated into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Then repeat this twice or thrice, until you know that all those added, filtered, flesh-like tissues that resemble the quill of a bird's wing are already burned.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those burned tissues come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
If, therefore, it is healed, it is good.
And if not, then it will never be healed with another treatment.
And if the protrusion emerges, and does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the protrusion, or similarly: and you see a fistula where the skin surface follows, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the protrusion which is in the fistula, until the cut reaches where the end of the protrusion reaches, and the protrusion is released and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered tissues, which are similar to the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
However, if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation, so that you cut those tissues: then better, and of quicker aid, cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Because cauterization with fire aggregates good qualities, the burning of those added tissues, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying of the moistures.
Then treat it with cloths wrapped in butter, or crushed herbs, until the place discharges pus, and those burned tissues exit in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which produce hard flesh: and these are medicines that have astringency and dryness.
For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear repetition. If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and is elongated by bodily superfluity: then introduce your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a stricture, and between you and it is a membrane of sifac or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation on it, except according to the path of confidence and hope.
For this is because one of three methods is administered to it: either to cauterize it, as we have said; or to dissect it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to introduce a ligature, and cure from the vicinity.
And do not proceed much with the incision, so that you do not cut the ligament containing the anus, and inflict on the weak a consequence of evacuation without will. Then treat it with what we have said. Perhaps indeed it will be cured; or you will lengthen the membrane, and cleanse it after you have cut it close to the anus, as we said, either with forceps or with another instrument of sharp tip.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh that are in the incision, until where you can with scrutiny.
Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision, and the upper opening where it consolidates; and a fistula will remain open in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier on the weak.
And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you introduce a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus, near the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like an alef needle, that is, for preparing hides, in this form.
And introduce into it a thread wrapped in five threads, and around it.
Then introduce the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
If therefore it penetrates into the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out from that opening; so that you introduce your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together; and tie each one, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread penetrates the flesh, tie it tightly until those tissues between the two thread ends are cut and fall away; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
For you do not have the ability to do this on account of the muscle, so as not to injure it.
Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
Shape a thorn-like spatula, with a very sharp curve, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not injure what is unnecessary, as you see.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision, and the treatment of fissures.
Chapter Eighty-one.
Hemorrhoids are according to two methods.
For they are either within the anus, similar to sacks of coals or prunes, or as if they were bunches of grapes themselves.
And from them are small, and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those which are outside the anus, are for the most part few in moisture, from which flows yellow water, or little blood with constant running: and they are according to the colour of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is that you should order the sick person to strain: and it should be pressed out, until it emerges from the anus, and the atheril appear to you.
Therefore also suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your fingernail.
Then cut them at their roots.
If however the hooks do not hold on them, because of their moisture and their softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with cotton made from double-layered wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Then cut them, and after the incision sprinkle some warm powders over them, so that they may stand in the place of a cautery.
Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then inject the infirm with an enema containing a small amount of mordicatio, so that it washes out what is in the anus, and it yields to evacuation quickly when the infirm expresses himself.
If, however, the piles are external from the anus, then their removal is easy: and it is as if you take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them.
Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
And whoever abhors incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method.
Take a wrapped thread, and insert it into the needle.
Then draw the piles upwards, and cause it to penetrate with the needle into its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be latitudinally: and tighten the piles with a strong tightening.
Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Do that with all the piles, and leave one of them: and do not sew it, so that blood will run from it.
Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil, or cerote, and place it over the anus: and tell the sick person to rest.
Then leave it until it falls.
When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and other treatment until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of Fissures.
Indeed, they often happen from the drying out of feces and from the constriction of nature.
When therefore they become hardened, and medicine is of no avail for them, then it is necessary to scrape them with a sharp-pointed spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the top layer which prevents their consolidation is removed.
Then treat them until they consolidate as is appropriate.
However, if they do not consolidate, then scrape them again with a more forceful instrument than the first, until they bleed profusely and are abraded; then treat them until they heal.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted Almirmar, and of dry Athelil and Formicae.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
From dry athelil, one is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence above the surface of the body.
And they often occur in the hands of children.
And its treatment is to stretch the athelil, and cut it; or to bind it with a silk thread; or with a needle, until it falls.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now inverted athelil are eradicated, and not inverted with the instrument which I shall name. A formica is also a small, filtered, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going deep: and when cold finds it, a sensation like the bite of an ant is felt in it, and it occurs throughout the body; and most of it occurs in the hands.
And its treatment is to take a cannula from a goose's feather, or a strong falcon's feather, and place that cannula over the Formica, until the circle of the cannula encompasses its parts.
Then turn your hand with the cannula, until you cut what is around the Formica; and you place it deep into the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root. And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air or iron, according to this form.
Let the top of the cannula be drawn up to the height of the deaf wrapping, so that the grasping and turning of it and itself may be relieved over the finger.
And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what is mentioned in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on the cautery.
Of the forms of instruments that are administered to enemas in diseases of the anus, and bowel evacuation, and colic.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Sometimes the clyster is made of silver, or of bronze, or of cast or hammered copper.
And sometimes it is made of these instruments small, and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of young children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, likewise their enemas.
Large clyster.
Small clyster.
Its tube, that is, the upper end where the bladder is tied, should be wide according to this method; and there should be a distinction so that the bladder is tied as you see, and its lower end that is inserted into the anus should be blunt, that is, not open, smooth, very much, drawing to slenderness; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and slightly thicker; and the bladder in which the medicines are placed should be from the bladder of an animal, or from the paper of an egg, which should be according to the form of a small asofrat; whose root is one palm.
When, therefore, the bladder is placed in it, it should be tightened at the head of the clyster between two distinguishing constrictions with a strong tightening.
Then administer the clyster with it.
And this is the form of the bladders here depicted, and the holes. However, the quality of administering the clyster with it is: that you fill the bladder, or the vesicle, with medicine, which should be heated according to the tolerance of the patient: and be careful that it is not too hot, or too cold.
Then the patient should lie on their back, and raise their legs upwards: and place under them an inthaan, that is, a hide upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar things.
Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Then let the attendant grasp the bladder with both hands together, and express it with force, until it evacuates all that is in the clyster into the intestine. Then remove the clyster, and let the patient raise their legs to the wall. If the medicine causes him to exit, then let him hold as long as possible.
And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
If, however, you clyster him in diseases of looseness of the belly, and his exit is hurried, then clyster again, until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or harmful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very thin, mild, from the clysters with which children are clystered.
And this be the form of a thin clyster above which there is tight skin.
Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already spoken in the division about the treatment of wounds, which was suitable for the book, and I shall now speak here about their treatment with the hand and with medicaments, according to the completion.
Therefore, I say that wounds are diversified according to the manner in which they are inflicted, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore, the things by which wounds are often inflicted are like the throwing of a stone; or the incision of a sword or knife; or a blow with a lance, or wood, or an arrow; and by similar things from many objects.
And the wounds that are inflicted according to the parts of the body are, such as a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver; and similar to those from the members.
And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may set forth that reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the recollection of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the impact of a stone, or similar things, and has only broken the skin: and is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately; and do not delay it; and extract from him blood according to the amount of his strength; if there is nothing preventing phlebotomy, especially if the blood that emerges from the wound is scant.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the patient beware of overeating, and wine, and heavy foods.
If, however, something prevents reduction, then reduce his food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And if a hot abscess happens to him, place on the wound a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
If, however, you are certain it is not a hot abscess, then if the wound is fresh with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, place on it the powder I will describe shortly; and if the air has already changed it, then place some ointments on it until it heals.
If, however, the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things: and its edges do not come together through pads, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their sutures.
If, however, the wound has already been detached from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it, except in a small suspension: then cut it.
Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the sick person to eat foods in which there is thickness, such as heads of grain and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulp; and things similar to these.
If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the putrefied part and throw it away; then treat it.
If, however, in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by medicines, then investigate the artery.
If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with a Spatumili, or tie it.
If necessity compels when that which we said does not help, then cauterize it until the blood is severed.
Method of the flesh-healing powder.
Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime; let the whole be finely ground, and sifted; and fill the wound with it, and bind it tightly, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it further with bandages, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not suppurate.
For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Then treat the rest with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Concerning wounds of the neck.
Chapter Eighty-five.
If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference between it in medication, and a wound of the head when it is simple.
If, however, the nerve of the neck, or artery, has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no cure for it except to avoid treatment that causes excessive astringency, like ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Because they harm the nerves, and contract them.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs; and let that which is used for treatment from medicines be gentle, such as lime washed with sweet water infused with oil several times, or with rose oil, and tutty, when it is also washed with sweet water; and the other mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
If, however, the wound is large, then administer sutures; or contract its lips with pledgets.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If however the wound has depth, or a sinus has occurred in its lower part, in which pus has already collected, then pierce it in the lowermost location in it.
If, however, an artery has already been cut in the wound, and its blood flow has ensued: then separate, or cut it, and tie it; or cauterize it, if necessity prompts that.
If, however, the throat's cartilages, or all of it, have been cut, and the surrounding structures have been saved: then bring together the skin's edges with sutures over the throat's cartilage, and do not touch the throat itself, rather make it even and restore it to its natural shape.
Then bind it with a proper bandage, and leave it for a few days.
Then treat it with ointments that possess astringency and drying properties, until it is healed.
If, however, the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then explore it; then, if there are bone fragments within it, extract all of them, or as many as you can; and leave what cannot be removed until the wound becomes putrid, and its discharge separates and is relieved.
If the wound is recent, then powder over it the powder I described.
If, however, bone is seen in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it with what is mentioned in its corresponding chapter.
Chapter LXXXVI.
If, therefore, wind issues from the wound, when the sick person breathes heavily from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if it does not have depth, and is fresh with its blood: then do not put powder on it in the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the sick person; but put an attracting ointment on it, and dissolve it twice a day.
If, however, the ointment is not present for you, then put an old poultice in the wound's opening, so that it sucks what emerges from it of the humors; and make the sick person sleep over the wound, so that what is collected in it runs out.
If, however, three days or more have already passed for the wound, and no spasm occurs in the sick person, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the rest of his conditions good, then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore, treat him with bandages and the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
If, however, his healing is excused, and it always opens again, then know that it has now become a fistula.
Therefore, treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what has preceded regarding sutures, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
If, however, it has already made an impression on the bone and chipped fragments from it, then investigate the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments if they are detached.
If however they are not detached, then leave them until the wound becomes putrid, for the extraction of them will be made easier.
For other accidental wounds in other limbs, the judgment in treatment is the judgment that we have stated.
Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their extrusion.
Chapter LXXXVII.
Rupture which happens to the belly is great, middle, and small.
From great rupture, therefore, sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, exits.
Therefore, their introduction, and their suturing is more violent and more difficult.
And small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
Therefore it follows, that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hasten in their introduction to their place immediately; because it is inflated, opened, and thickened; therefore, its entrance becomes difficult.
Therefore, a better rupture is the middle rupture; because with it there is not a difficult reduction of the intestine, as it is difficult in these two types.
Know that the suturing of the belly is according to four ways.
Two common sutures agree with the suturing of the belly, and in the suturing of the remaining wounds of the body; and two other sutures properly agree with the remaining wounds.
However, they are more proper with the suturing of the belly; and I tell you each one with an exposition and declaration. Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine protrudes from it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then that is because of one of two ways.
Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: or because there is inflation in the intestine due to the cold air.
When therefore it is so, then it is necessary to warm it, so that you immerse a sponge, or a damp cloth, in lukewarm water alone.
Or boil it in water with squill, and cyperus, and spike, and apply it to the intestine with it until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine that has astringency does it, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow or mallow has been boiled.
For by that its entrance is alleviated with a small thing.
If however its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the disruption with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when prepared than the incision: and no compulsion is made to cut after necessity and the lack of the instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted and sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the fine end not be as fine as a Spatumilis, but rather a little more blunt: and that is what is similar to a caiada, as you see.
When therefore the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form to its proper place, if possible, above it; because that is better.
When, however, the rupture is extensive in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
And so it is necessary to administer that in large wounds, and in medium wounds.
In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then have a pious attendant present, who holds the entire rupture with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Then uncover from it for him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the common mode of a single suture.
And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's breadth.
Then leave from the extremity of the rupture a quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician: and fix one needle past that into it, passing the thread into both extremities of the skin, with both extremities of that which is under the skin from the interior, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together the two extremities of the skin, and the two extremities of that which is thus: and four rows are made.
Then tighten with the double thread in a circular motion of the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are brought together in a fitting aggregation.
Then leave a thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterwards tie it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Therefore do not cease to do that with what needles you need, until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
And the needles should be of intermediate thickness between thin and thick; because very thin needles cut flesh very quickly, and thick needles are difficult to enter the skin; therefore they must be intermediate in thinness and thickness.
And it is not appropriate for the needle to be fixed in the two closely adjacent skin edges too much, so that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound is opened before it is consolidated, and they should not be pulled too tight with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Then trim the ends of the needles, so that they do not harm the patient during their sleep; and put pads of cloth on all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
And this type of suture with needles is more suitable in small wounds.
Because one or two, or approximately that number, of needles is sufficient for their suture.
However, the second common suture is to bring together the four edges: two skin edges and two edges of a similar nature, with a needle in which an equal thread, fine and thick, is wound.
Then, when you have pierced these four edges with the needle, pull the needle back from the side from which you began, so that the wound thread falls from the upper part of the wound; so that the suture will be like the stitching of cloth used to bind cloths, and place between each stitch a quantity equal to the thickness of a smaller finger.
However, men know this suture.
And with this suture I myself healed a wound which had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was torn open more than a palm; and about two palms of the middle intestine had emerged from the intestines, and the rupture was in the middle of the belly.
Therefore I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Therefore the wound was consolidated in a space of approximately fifteen days; and I treated him, and he was healed; and he lived many years after that, engaged in his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that it would not heal.
And it was by a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor any medicine, was to be found.
Therefore, I placed old linen over the wound twice a day, and diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
I will now state two specific types of suture, according to the account of the text.
And it is that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and going into the muscle along the length and breadth of the entire body, leave the end thus in the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate in the other end from the inner part to the outer in the other extremity mirach.
When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extremity mirach from the outer part to the inner: and leave the extremity sifac, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other extremity from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration, as you make it penetrate in the sifac extremity mirach, which is on its side, until it penetrates the whole of it.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the extremity, which is from sifac on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it has pierced.
Then return it to that skin, and sew the sifac extremity, which is on the other side, with this mirach extremity: and withdraw it from the skin which is on its side, and do it once, and again: and do it time after time, until you sew the whole exterior according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is that it sew the skin of the leather workers, as they sew skins: so that you sew sifac with one turn from one extremity of the skin: and that you let it go with another turn from the other side, until you complete it.
The second species of proper suture, which Galen said.
His speech relates that you should sew it according to the manner in which some physicians sew them, so that they bring every part to its naturally fitting counterpart; and they apply the sifac extremity to its other extremity, and the mirach extremity to its other extremity.
And that is done according to what I tell you.
You should place the needle into the mirach extremity closest to you on the outside, and have it pierce to the inside in that part only; and you should let go of the two sifac extremities.
Then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside to the inside in the two sifac extremities, namely on both sides.
Then turn both of them, also making them pierce from the inside to the outside in the two other mirach extremities, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and is a suture whose recollection precedes.
This is therefore also Galen's discourse.
And some said.
The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles.
That is, insert one thread in each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from the one that is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew leather equally.
And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than the other parts of the belly.
However, the judgment of the treatment of a wound is the judgment of the other wounds.
That is, when you acquire a fresh wound with its own blood, before air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and suture it, and fit it, then place it over the flesh-inducing powder.
If air has already altered the wound, then place upon it some ointments that are present to you, until they produce pus: and the threads fall, and it consolidates, and mirach.
Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
However, if the medicines are not present to you, then place upon it immediately, from when it begins to emit pus, old cloth: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
If, however, you fear that the wound communicates with the principal limbs in the injury, then it is necessary that you immerse soft wool in oil of temperate warmth, or in rose oil: and place it around the places which are between the groin and under the armpits.
If, however, he feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens) then enema him with astringent, black, warm wine: especially if putridity has already reached the intestine, and has become a penetrating exit right to its cavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing: and that which is from the small, of more difficult healing.
However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, a space has passed it, and it has already become green, or black, then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place which has blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
For in zirbum are veins and arteries.
Then cut that which is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the pulling of it may be alleviated upon you, and the extraction of it at the occurrence of zirbum, and the emission of the wound's pus.
Memorization of the wound that occurs in the Intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some people; for this reason, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a spear thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old; and it became a fistula, and excrement and wind issued from it.
Therefore, I applied a treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until he was healed, and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick man, that an evil accident might befall him in his belly; and no such evil accident befell him from that.
And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and copulating, and entered a bath, and exercised in his daily activities.
And now certain experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is necessary that it be ligated in this way.
And it is, that you should take ants of large heads.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those which have an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
When therefore it has settled upon them, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not loosen.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the size of the entire wound.
Then reduce it, and suture the wound.
For those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm comes to the sick person at all. And now it is possible that the intestine be tied even with a fine thread: which is cleaned from the intestine of an animal, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
And it is, that you take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and it is much scraped.
Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its extremity.
Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Then reduce it into the disruption. And this method of sewing with ants and intestine is not except according to the way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy except subtlety, nor is its healing at all.
Concerning the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that every wound, or abscess, when it grows old and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and continually discharges pus, and is not cut away: then it is universally called, wherever in the body it may be, a fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula, in truth, is a filtered, hard, white knot; with which there is no pain, having the concavity of a bird's feather: and because of this some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And in some hours it is moist, which emits pus.
And perhaps the moisture is cut open in some hours.
And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little; and sometimes thick, and sometimes thin.
And I have already mentioned in the division, when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor flesh grows on it, is not that but for one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body, or because of its malice, or because between it and on its lips there is hard flesh, preventing the birth of flesh, or because it is full of filth and dirt, or because the ulcer is itself putrid, and the material applied to it is of poor quality, or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment, or because corruption falling in the region is a form of pestilence, or because of a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, in which there is difficult digestion of illnesses, and the healing of abscesses by nature is delayed, or because there is one bone, or a number of bones, in it.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here to make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by the way of operation with the hand.
Therefore know that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
For of them are Fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews, or the intestines, or the bladder, or to any of the ribs, or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joints of the limbs, such as hands and feet; and of them are those that go to the proximity of the principal limb, and similar ones.
Therefore, whichever of these fistulas is of this type, is from illnesses difficult to cure, and does not receive treatment, and dealing with it is laborious and ignorant.
If there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to arrive at its understanding, then take a probe of air or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
If however there is a winding in the fistula, then investigate it with a slender lead probe.
Because lead, with the lightness of its body, is easily moved and bent around the winding.
If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe.
Therefore, irrigate it from one of its openings.
For the moisture you irrigate it with, goes towards the other openings, and runs from them.
Then diligently investigate how you can determine whether there is a bone or nerve, and whether the fistula's hollow is deep or shallow, or whether it is a single fistula with many openings.  Stand over the entire area with all your strength, questioning the ill person, and by feeling the pain when you press with your hand on the area and by similar signs and causes of accidents and abscesses.
When, therefore, you have stood over all that area correctly, then proceed to the treatment with confidence.  And you should consider if the fistula is a superficial one, or located safely far from a joint, or a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places I have told you about.  Then, cut the fistula according to what I have previously described, and remove what is inside it: pus, and corrupted flesh that grows from the fistula's opening or the surrounding tissue, and other similar things.  And treat it until it heals.
If, however, the fistula is deep and located properly, then you must cut it as deep as possible.
Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply strips soaked in sharp medicines, and insert them into the hollow of the fistula that you have grasped with the iron. Do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the fistula's hollow from the corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh, until it heals.
If it does not heal by that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
If, therefore, the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is confirmed by you, then search for it and cut it according to what I have told you: if nothing from a vein, or nerve, or principal limb hinders you, as we said.
If, therefore, bone is found by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Then treat it with that which causes it to flesh over, until it heals.
If it does not heal, and discharges pus as it did: then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore, expose it again and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with all your strength.
Then restore it.
If it therefore heals, it is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a deep distant part of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore, you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
If the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suitable for it.
If, however, there are many bones, then carefully make an extraction of all of them, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
If, however, some moisture creates an obstacle for you, and there is no fear or error in incising them: then incise those moistures and flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
If, however, you do not have the preparation to remove the bones from your time, then place over the wound something that will cause it to putrefy: and leave it, until that which is around those bones is putrefied from the flesh and moisture.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
And bind the section that you have cut in your operation.
Indeed, place over it, if you fear, a cloth soaked in crushed sulfur mixed with oil; or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any other green ointments.
For when those humidities putrefy, and the bones separate from them, the removal and extraction of them is alleviated.
If however there is one large bone, such as a bone of the leg, or a hip bone, and similar to them, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Then restore the wound.
If however that which is corrupted within it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it, and to cut it completely up to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it consolidates. And I tell you a story, which happened to a man in his leg: so that you may place it as an example and help upon your operation.
There was a young man of about thirty years, to whom pain happened in his leg, from a cause that arose within his body, that is, from the insides, until the matter reached the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess: and there was no external cause for it.
So, time passed with him and with the errors of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many matters ran together with him.
And his treatment was delayed, until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus and the humors of the body.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wise one in the art of hands among them, until I was called, and saw his leg, and the matters that were running from those openings with great flow: also the whole body of the man was now putrid, and his color was yellowish.
I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to reach one another from all parts of the leg. Therefore, I proceeded and cut over one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already corroded, and blackened, and putrid, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore, I removed what I had uncovered, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was nothing in the bone but that corruption which I had cut away and removed.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restorative treatment to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly and healed: and this repetition in its operation and incision was not necessary, except because of the weak patient's condition, and their small tolerance, and my fear for their death; for it happened to them at all hours due to the excess of evacuative syncopes.
Therefore he was healed completely: and firm flesh grew in the place of the bone, and his body's condition became good, and his strength returned, and he resumed his normal functions, and no impediment to walking was caused to him at all.
However, if a prominent bone in a fractured part of the body exists, then it is necessary to saw it, in this manner: and this is so that you take a bandage and tighten it at the extremity of the prominent bone, and instruct someone to extend it upwards, and place another bandage of thicker wool over the first bandage. Then tie it over the flesh which is beneath the bone: and extend its extremity so that you pull the flesh downwards: and you uncover the flesh over the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place wood, or a plank, underneath the bone properly below: for when you do this, it does not hinder it from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place for a little while, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone, and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compels sawing in another place. If the bone is corrupted, and is not prominent, but rather its part continues with another part, and the corruption is in its middle or in a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all sides entirely.
Then place wood below.
Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued from the other part; and let the sawing be along the length from the corruption a little, according to what we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues from the other part.
If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it but abrasion.
If the corruption is in the finger of the hand, or in the toe of the foot: then the matter is very difficult in it.
But it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you.
And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever remedy it is rectified for you: when it does not cause you opposition from the vein, or nerve.
And know that there are many chisels and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity.
Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a suitable instrument of every kind of operation for that operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the form of the instrument you need, when you have diligent study.
And knowledge of the methods of this art is a testament to the methods of illnesses; for then you will already find for yourself that which is suitable for it from the instruments for every ailment.
Saw shape.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
This saw shape, depicted, be made decently. Let its upper arch be sharpness of iron; and its handle of boxwood, and let it be a pyramid, decently made.
Shape of the razor's joints.
Let the head of this razor be, according to the shape of a star-shaped nail's head; and its points be according to the shape of the points of a whetstone.
And it is not suitable, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it when they are damaged, or the bone is large and great.
Shape of the larger razor.
Shape of the middle razor.
Shape of the broad razor.
Shape of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Shape of the other, slender razor.
Shape of the other razor with a curved end.
Shape of a small, slender, taut razor.
Shape of the razor with which bones are cut.
Shape of a large razor as well.
This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw; it is shown in many places by reason of cutting bones.
Shape of the razor suitable for the cutting of what is perforated in the bones.
Its end is triangular, with sharp ends.
It is made of India.
And similarly, all that we have said must be done with razors, and knives, and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Chapter LXXXIX.
Extremities putrefy either from an external cause or an internal one.
Therefore, if you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and the treatment does not help, and you see the corruption affecting a limb, which nothing is repelling: then you must cut that limb to the point where the corruption reaches, so that it escapes weakness by it from death, or from an evil that is greater than the limb's defect.
And a sign of this happening is that the limb darkens until it rots; that fire has burned it, or that it rots after turning black; until that rot is cut to the point following that limb, and spreads to the entire body.
Therefore, act quickly with its incision, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, viper, and rattlesnake, and similar ones.
If, therefore, the corruption or injury is in the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to proceed to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold of the forearm.
And if it invades it, then cut the arm at the elbow at its joint. If, however, the corruption passes, and you see it about the elbow, then in that is the death of the sick person.
And to administer beyond that from treatment, is a matter of virtuosity.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades the toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it takes hold of the foot's sole, then cut off the entire foot.
If, however, it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
If, however, the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for dismissal, and leaving the sick person to death.
And the manner of cutting off a limb, or sawing it, is that you should tighten the ligament below which you wish to cut; and tighten another ligament above the place.
And let the servant extend one ligament downwards; and let the servant extend the other ligament upwards.
And you should separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Then it should be cut, or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw does not touch healthy tissue; and that added injury and a hot abscess befall the sick person.
If, however, an internal bleeding occurs while you are working, then cauterize the place quickly, or place some powders that stop bleeding on it.
Then return to your treatment, until it is completed.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and care for it until it is healed.
And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same event that I tell you about.
That is, because a blackness occurred in his foot, with a burning like the combustion of fire: and that corruption first occurred in his toe, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Therefore, the man hurried himself, after he saw the corruption occurring in the limb with its intensity, which he found from its pain and burning: and it occurred to him at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time passed, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand. Therefore, he came to me, and I tried to remove that excess with what I placed on his hand from medicines after cleansing his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger: until the corruption began to affect his hand.
Therefore, he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping for a repulsion of that excess from me: and I also feared death for him at the incision of his hand.
Because the man's strength was over the case.
Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it reached me about him, that he hastened, and cut his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not brought forth this narration, except that it might be of assistance concerning that which falls under this kind of illness: and that it might be a signification by which one might signify and act accordingly.
Of the treatment of Sinuses, and the nature of clysterization with medicines.
Chapter 90.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts, or is pierced, and that which is within it of pus escapes, and a hollow place remains, as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it, like a cloth that has already become thin: and it has not reached the final stage of its corruption, nor does it affect the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged until the corruption affects any of these parts, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is to cut away that entire skin as it is rolled back, and especially when it has become thin, and is like a cloth; and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
However, if you suspect that the skin adheres, and that corruption does not follow from that final adhesion; and if there is a thickening of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster; and it is necessary to consider it as a Sinus.
Then, if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor, then clyster it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, and these are to be aggregated in a vessel; and they are to be boiled over fire, until the medicine turns red; and it comes to the consistency of honey.
Then take of that which you need; and dissolve it with water and honey, and clyster the sinus with it; and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for a period of two hours.
Then extract it with pressure; do this for so many days, until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present for you; and it is necessary to take the ash of vine wood, or the ash from holly wood; and pour water over it.
Then strain it, and clyster with it, until you are confident that the sinus is now cleansed.
If the patient does not tolerate Egyptian medicine, nor ash water, then clyster him with water and honey, to which has been mixed something of crushed ziniar.
Or clyster him with honey and wine mixed, because of the property of honey is to cleanse and wash away; and wine causes the sinus to adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus is now removed, then clyster him with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
And it is that you take from the dyafinicon plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or clyster him with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
If the sinus opening is constricted, so that the clyster tube cannot enter, then widen it slightly with an iron implement; or place in it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basil ointment, until it widens.
And similarly if the opening is also wide, then bring together its edges with a suture, and leave an amount in which the clyster can enter without addition.
And similarly if the opening from which pus runs is elevated upwards, then cut it in the lower place within it, so that pus runs from it downwards; because when pus is confined in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus approximately below the part you wish, then try to prepare the limb in a way that the pus runs from it easily, as preparation allows you.
Try to keep nothing of the pus within it, and take the consolidating medicines that are placed on the sign, suitable to what you want.
And spread them over a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such a size that it covers the entire sinus.
Then cut with scissors, in a straight line to the opening of the sinus, a hole a little larger than the opening of the sinus.
Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it over the first, at a distance from the sinus opening, so that the pus may escape from it, and do not remove the large cloth, except after a few days at a time.
However, the one over the sinus opening is the one you remove every hour, so that what gathers in it from pus may escape, and so that you may know whether the matter running from it, the virus, is much or little, or digested or undigested.
And with this, again, consider the location of the sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain there, or there is no pain, and whether there is an abscess there, or there is no abscess there.
Therefore, when your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the matter escaping over the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or approaching adherence; then, therefore, loosen it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you loosen the wound, then change the cloth and renew the ointment. However, if a thin virus emerges from the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, because there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
If, however, undigested pus emerges from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If, therefore, the adherence of the sinus is delayed, and its progress prolonged: then, in the drying of the medicines, let the physicians so arrange that the medicines are moist in their substance, and dry in their virtue; such as the ointment of diaphynicon, when superfluity of addition from zegi is added to it.
And the most ultimate of its cures is that you take ointment of diaphynicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it old wine equal in its substance.
Then mix it with that, and use it.
And it does a similar action to this, when ointment of diaphynicon is not present to you, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Then line a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus: and line with the honey which you boiled until it thickened: and powder spices over it, and place over it the cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of the lily of the valley, and the lily, and herb flour, and centaury are administered in it.
Use them simple, or aggregated, grind them, and sieve them: and powder them over the honey that I have described, and use it.
If the sinus persists and is not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it: or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then cure it by the treatment of fistulas, as has been previously described. On the treatment of whitlow and worn nail, and the incision of the added finger, and the section.
Chapter XCI.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or the foot: and perhaps it arises in the other fingers.
When, therefore, the condition persists, and its treatment is neglected, and the abscess becomes a hot abscess: or it is corrupted and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the entire nail, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor: and the end of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes dark.
Therefore, when you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary to cut with an iron all the excess which remains of the nail.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
For cautery is very helpful.
If, however, the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the superfluous additions of the nail are now pressing the flesh inwards, and beginning to prick it and injure it: then it is necessary to place a fine needle under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards: and cut the flesh easily, and put upon what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until its entire removal.
Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
If, however, corruption has already affected the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and extract it: for it will never be healed while the corrupted bone remains in it.
If you see corrosion and corruption spreading into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, according to the previous mention of it.
Then treat it, until it is healed.
If, however, the nail suffers attrition, or a blow, and a severe pain occurs in it, then it is necessary to first bleed the weak person.
Then cut the nail with a sharp Spatumili in a transverse cut from above, for visibility.
And beware that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the afflicted by it, and there will be a reason for an addition of flesh to grow in that place.
Then treat the place with that which calms the pains.
The extra finger that arises in some human hands is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps some of them have bones, and perhaps a nail is on it; and some arise at the joint's root, or its birth is in some of the finger's knots.
Therefore, the one that arises in some knots of the finger does not move; and the one that arises near the finger's joint perhaps moves.
Therefore, the one that is fleshy of them, its incision is easy.
That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
However, the treatment of the one whose birth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Therefore, abstain from its incision.
In that one however, which is born on the finger at the last of the nodes, then it is necessary to cut first its flesh with a round incision up to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable to it.
Then treat it until it is healed.
But consolidation which happens to fingers together often happens either from the birth of the man, that is, is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or burning of fire, and similar things.
Therefore it is necessary to separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place between them bandages or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate between them; or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the place is consolidated as it should be.
And similarly, if consolidation happens between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incision of a defect.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Ulcers are wrapped veins, large, full of melancholic superfluities that occur in many parts of the body; and their effect is most often in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and work, and carry burdens.
Therefore, it is necessary to administer a shaking of the body from black bile occasionally with a strong shaking.
Then phlebotomize the patient at the basilic vein.
The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods.
One of them is that they should be cut and the black blood extracted.
And the other method is that the vein should be raised, and the whole of it extracted.
The section of it is according to this method.
First, bathe the leg in much hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the patient's leg, from the upper part of the thigh to the lower part of the knee, with a bandage.
Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then cut the nail (or something) downwards: until an amount of blood sufficient and bearable by the patient's strength emerges.
Then tie it off; and tell him to abstain from foods producing black bile; and again perform evacuation and phlebotomy, when the veins are filled, and it harms the patient.
However, its elevation is according to this method.
Shave the leg of the patient, if there are many hairs on it.
Then immerse him in a bath; or apply a warm water embrocation to his leg until it turns red, and the veins protrude; or have him exercise vigorously, if a bath is not available, until the limb becomes warm.
Then cut the skin in the direction of the vein incision lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or in the lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from every side, until it appears to the sense: and it is at its appearance, that you see it sloping from red to black.
When it then emerges from the skin, you see it white, as if it were a cord.
Then introduce a probe beneath it, until when it is lifted and exits the skin: suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Then make another incision near that incision by three fingers.
Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears.
Then lift it with probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need them.
Then lift it, and cut it at the very last incision, near the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision above it.
And do this until you pull it out of the incision which is higher, or above all the incisions, until the whole thing comes out: then cut it.
If however it does not yield to you in pulling and lifting it, then insert a needle with a strong doubled thread, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod under it, and turn your hand in every direction until it comes out.
And be careful not to cut it.
For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and harm enters upon the weak from it.
When therefore you have pulled it all out, then put on the wound place wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and treat it until it heals.
If the vine is contracted, having twists for which there is a wrapping to the sides, and is not as we said in terms of straightness, then it is necessary that you cut along every twist of it and the places of its wrapping.
Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it all out: and be careful in your cutting on it not to cut a vein, or wound it; for it will become difficult for you to lift or remove it.
Therefore, preserve your caution.
Form of the incident whereby the vine is healed.
Form of a blind hook.
It does not have the curvature like the other hooks, nor a sharp tip so as not to wound a vein: and it is of a thick, flexible form; for if it were slender, it would cut a vein with its slenderness; indeed, let its thickness be excessive, as we have said.
On the extraction of the vein of the leg. Chapter Ninety-three.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, like Al-Azeej, and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, of little tenderness, that is, in which no grass or tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as occurs within the bodies of snakes and worms (ascarides), and worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg.
Then the place becomes blistered.
Then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, then you must wrap a piece of lead over it, whose weight is from one drachm to two drachms, and tie it; and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
Whenever therefore something emerges from it outward, wrap that in lead and tie it.
If it extends very far, then cut a part of it, and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it at the root before the whole of it emerges.
Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it must be gently handled and drawn out gradually until the last part of it emerges, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein indeed, in some men, something emerges which is in its length five palms and ten.
And it has come to me that it emerged from a man of twenty palms.
If, however, you cut it during your hour of medication, then introduce a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long, slender probe, until all matter within it is evacuated, and treat the putrefaction of the area with medicines for a few days. Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself, and it has many openings, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Therefore, treat it as we have said in the division, and with what has been previously stated.
Concerning the incision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called the cattle disease.
Chapter XCIV.
This disease is called in a certain land among us the cattle disease, because it often happens to oxen, and is a small, single worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending, and it is shown to the senses by its passage from limb to limb, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
As worms and snakes, that is, intestinal worms, and threadworms, occur in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice.
Because when it travels through the body and rises to the head and reaches a place, then perhaps it bursts there, and emerges, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
Therefore, when one intends to treat it and extract it, this is not done except by its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore, it is necessary to bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong constricting bandage.
Then cut above it and extract it.
If it has burrowed into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the area until it dies.
And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said. If, however, you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good constriction.
Then cut above it and extract it.
And it is necessary that the sick person use cleansing of his body, with medicines dissolving bad putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision above the illness Nakir.
Chapter XCV.
This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then moves from limb to limb.
And I myself have already seen it, as I relate to you.
I was called to a weak woman in certain villages.
And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I remained one hour, I saw one swelling moving with a quiver, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than possible, so that it is like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Therefore, the pain receded from that place and fixed itself in the shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it was turning around in her whole body, as I had seen.
Therefore, I was amazed at the speed of its change from limb to limb.
And I myself had not previously seen this illness with my own eyes in this way.
However, I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb: and I have not seen it with my eyes, as I have seen it in the woman.
And I do not think it is anything else, except that it is because the woman was from those who are from villages, with dry bodies and detected veins: therefore, this windy movement appears to the senses.
And it is necessary that they do not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
When, therefore, you wish to cure it, and the patient feels the pain: then if it is apparent to you with the eye, as we have said, then tighten above it, and below it quickly: and cut above it, until that confined windiness emerges: and cauterize the place.
If, however, you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with shaking the body, and with that which expels winds, and pacifies them with foul pills, and pills of serpent, and similar things.
Concerning the extraction of Arrows.
Chapter XCVI. Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in which they strike the body.
Their diversity is such, for some have large points, and small ones, and concave, and blunt ones.
And some have three angles.
And some have tongues.
And some have stars.
Those, however, which are according to the members on which they fall, are according to two ways.
For either the members are from the principal concave members, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and similar to them.
Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and signs of death appear to you, which I tell you afterward, then you ought to avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone and exits through the membrane that is over the brain, are: because violent sweating, and blindness, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of bile occur from it.
And perhaps blood exits from the nostrils or ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice destroyed.
And white moisture resembling gruel emerges from the wound site.
And from it emerges something like the watery part of flesh.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not emerge.
The signs of an arrow striking the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and that, when touching it, it feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty one.
And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the pulse's movement, and black blood flows from the wound.
And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope.
Therefore know that death undoubtedly descends.
And a sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the outflow of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels that follow the neck suppurate, and the sick person's color changes.
And he breathes out a great, deep breath; and seeks the attraction of cold air.
If an arrow strikes the covering, which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great breath with intense pain, with a gasp; and all the shoulder members are moved.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps some indigested food will come out of the wound.
And if an arrow strikes the abdomen, and is fixed in it, some excrement, or zirbum, or intestine already ruptured, will issue from the wound.
Therefore, there is no hope of curing it, nor of removing the arrow.
If the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine issues forth, and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain is stronger than the weakness: then know that it is mortal.
However, the remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and ribs, and vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are saved according to various conditions, when the arrow does not strike an artery, or a nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned.
And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may understand about your treatment through it.
Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, beneath the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had struck him in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I did not obtain from it except a small end of it, with which it adheres to its shaft: and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no misfortune happened to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arab arrow, and it is one which has ears.
Therefore, I cut above it between the two guides: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Therefore I proceeded cautiously with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Therefore, after thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut above the arrow: and I worked on it, and I extracted it: and he was healed, and no harm befell him.
And I saw a man in whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound was healed over it.
Therefore, after seven years, an arrow emerged at the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman into whose belly an arrow had fallen, and the wound was healed over it, and the arrow remained within her.  And no change occurred in her condition, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, in whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound was healed, and it remained, causing him little pain: and many similar things to these.
And I removed an arrow from the king's chief men, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already inclined slightly to the right side: and the entire arrow was hidden.
Therefore, I was called to treat him after the arrow's impact for up to three days.
Therefore, I found the arrow wound to be very tight.
I therefore searched for it with a fine probe, and did not feel it: and indeed, he felt a prick and pain beneath his right ear.
Therefore, I hoped that the prick was from the arrow's tip.
Therefore, I plastered the area with a plaster possessing attractive and digestive properties, confident that the area would form an abscess and that I would see a sign of the arrow so that I could cut above it: and it did not happen in the area that there was an accident signifying that the arrow had struck the area.
Therefore, I applied the plaster to it for many days: and no accident happened, and the wound healed meanwhile; and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose.
And he told me that.
Therefore, I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it, I felt a thin arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the arrowhead appeared to us visibly; and I spent approximately four months with him during that time.
Then, after the wound had been enlarged, and I was able to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to removal, I did not cease to refine and devise methods upon it, until one day I began to use properly made forceps, according to the form they will take at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the infirm man was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may set it as a rule and signification concerning what I have not said.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed by the narrative; nor does that book encompass it, and a skillful craftsman compares the little with the much: and with what is present, with what is absent; and finds a new operation and a new instrument in the descent of foreign things of this art when they occur.
I say, therefore, that arrows do not emerge from the members to which they are fixed, except in two ways. Or by traction from the place from which it entered.
Or by the opposite of the other part.
And that which emerges from where it entered is either an arrow progressing in a fleshy place, and is drawn out and emerges.
If it does not yield to exit at the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary to leave it for some days, until the flesh that is around it putrefies, and its traction is eased, and its emergence.
And similarly, if it is fixed in bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for some days, and repeatedly apply traction and motion every day until it emerges.
If it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary to perforate around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow's path is widened.
Then pull it and extract it.
However, if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already progressed into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those accidents which I have described appear from the sick person, then refrain from pulling the arrow, and leave it, until its condition is equalized after days.
For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate to the sifach: and the sick person remains for a few days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him: then proceed in pulling the arrow and extracting it.
However, if it is fixed firmly, and does not yield to you for extraction: then apply a drill around the arrow, as I have told you: then treat the place, until it is healed.
If however the arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sight, then seek it with probes.
If however you feel it, then pull it out with certain instruments suitable for its extraction.
If however you cannot get at it, due to the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow deep inside: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then enlarge upon it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
If however there are ears to which it is attached, then free the flesh fixed to them from every side, by every method you can, and try, if it cannot be released by breaking the ears and twisting them, until it escapes.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps, to all parts, until you make it escape: and be subtle to the utmost subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
If you cannot get at it within one hour, then leave it for several days, until those things surrounding it putrefy.
Then try again: for it will then be easier.  However, if a flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we have said about treatment in its chapter: and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And use all the means possible for the escape of the arrow: and let it be with ease and calmness, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary, that when you pull the arrow, you make it weak according to the form in which the arrow was wounded.
Because it is more helpful.
If, however, that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
However, if an arrow emerges from the opposite side of the other, either something already proceeds from it outwards, or the arrowhead creates a bump on the skin's surface above, and you see it protruding: therefore, cut above it, and let the cut be according to the size that the forceps can grasp.
Then pull it: for it will then be easy to remove.
However, if it remains embedded in the bone, then twist your hand in a circular motion until the arrow presses against the bone, and widens the space for itself; then pull it.
And if not, leave it for a few days; then try it again until it comes out.
If the arrow's wood is embedded in it, then push it out along with it.
However, if the wood has broken off and you wish to administer a push, then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then push it out with it.
If the arrow is concave, then push it with an instrument entering into it.
For the arrow is relieved by it.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut away all the flesh in which the poison is, if that is possible for you.
Then treat it with whatever is appropriate for it.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side; and it is close to what you are touching with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it; then cut, and beware of cutting a vein, or a nerve, and pull it out.
Then sew the wound, if you see it, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the extremities be like the beak of a bird, made of iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
And many forms are made from them, large, and small, and medium, according to the quantity of the arrow's size, and its smallness, and the breadth of the wound, and its constriction.
The form of the concave pusher.
And the form of the deaf pusher.
This is the deaf extremity, like a ray, so that its entrance into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be driven with it.
The extremity of this concave pusher is concave like a bird's feather, so that the entrance of the arrow into it and its impulse may be eased.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
Chapter XCVII. Thirty veins are those to be opened, whose use runs through the body.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which appear in the two temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, called the Looking veins; and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the extremity of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins that are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins called Algecherich.
And two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins, however, which are opened in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the wild side: and the common people call it the vein of the head.
And the Fusca.
And there is the Medial vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the Basilic, and it is situated on the domestic side: and it is also called the Tickler.
And the common people call it the vein of the belly.
And the Brachial vein, and it is situated above the fold: and it is the one in which bloodletting is done, and it is the one that appears above the thumb by clear appearance.
And the Salvatella: and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb on the wild side.
And the second is the Saphena: and its place is at the heel on the domestic side.
And the vein Nesse: and its place is at the heel on the wild side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomies of the two veins behind the ears are beneficial for chronic colds, and hemiplegia, and headache, and bad old ulcers of the head.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is according to what I relate.
And it is, that the patient's head be shaved, and his occiput be rubbed in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth by good rubbing.
Then let the patient tie his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark that spot with ink.
Then take a phlebotomous knife, and it is called the cutting one.
Then insert it beneath the vein in the skin, until the phlebotomous reaches the opening.
Then elevate your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin with an incision that cuts into it.
And let the length of the incision be the quantity of two joined fingers, or approximately that: and make as much blood exit as you wish.
Then bind it with bandages, and leave it until it heals.
And already in the beginning of the book was the incision of them, and the cauterization of them.
On the phlebotomy of two arteries in the temples.
The phlebotomy of the two arteries in the two temples is beneficial for chronic headaches; and for crooked noses and frequent eye diseases; and for the excessive flow of acute humors to the eyes. And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I tell you.
Let the sick person hold their neck tightly, until two veins appear clearly to the eye; and let their pulse be evident under your finger.
Then mark the spots with ink.
Then, lift the skin above the vein upward with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upward.
And cut it, as you did in the other two veins: and cause blood to flow according to your need. Then loosen the constriction of the sick person, and place your finger over the vein for one hour.
Afterwards, place a poultice and pads on it, and tighten it firmly over the constriction; and leave it until it is healed.
And already the remembrance of them, and their incision, and their extraction, has preceded at the beginning of the book.
Of phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein.
Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the forehead vein is after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein, for old facial ailments, and for migraine, and redness, and foul ulcers.
And its quality of phlebotomy is, according to what I tell you.
The sick man tightens his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument which is called Fossorium.
Its form is this.
Place the prominent point which is on the head of the Fossorium over the vein itself, and strike it with a comb, or with something else in its manner: and let the blood run according to the amount that you wish.
Then loosen the wound of the sick person, and bind it, until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotome.
However, it should not be a phlebotome with a sharp tip, like the other phlebotomes, but rather with a wide tip.
And open it with the phlebotome across the vein; since the bone is close by, and perhaps the phlebotome will break when it is slender.
Concerning the opening of the veins in the two tear ducts.
The benefit of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes is for the eye from scabies and redness; and swelling in the eye, and diseases of the face.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that it tightens the weak neck with a bandage.
Then open them with the phlebotome, and you be standing over its head.
And let the phlebotomy be performed across, slightly lengthwise, with a small, somewhat broad phlebotome, for there is no flesh in the place.
For if the phlebotome is of a slender extremity, perhaps it will break.
Then make the blood flow out as much as you need.
And place a compress over them, and bind them for one night, and unbind them.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the Nose.
Phlebotomy of the veins of the Nose is beneficial in acute fevers, and violent headaches, and diseases of the face, such as migraine, and redness that occurs in the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the infirm person tightens their neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long lancet, and insert it into the middle of his nostril, between that which separates the nose according to its straightness.
Because the vein is not apparent to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And you should hold your hand with the lancet for a short time, and make blood flow according to your need.
Then tie it with one bandage.
For it is quickly restored.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of Guidegi.
The phlebotomy of Guidegi's two veins is helpful for constriction of breath, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and evil ulcers, and those that corrode, that is, eruptive herpes.
And the quality of phlebotomy of those veins is such that the weak man should be held up by both hands on his neck with a bandage: and the craftsman should stand over the head of the sick man, and the sick man should be seated upon a seat.
Then the phlebotomist should open the vein to a length of ample phlebotomy for a little while.
Then draw out a moderate quantity of blood, or according to that which you see necessary for it.
Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the bandage, and bind the two veins with a middle constriction, so that the sick person is not choked.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound is healed.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins by Algeberich.
The veins, according to Algeberich, are helpful in phlebotomy, because they contribute to alchol in the mouth, and the corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and the fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those which are in the nose and in its surroundings.
And the quality of phlebotomy of them is, that you should make the infirm person sit before you, and bind his neck with a cloth.
Then, roll back his lip, and look at the two veins: one is on the right of the lip, and the second on its left; and the demonstration of both is through the blackness of both.
And that is true, because around them are small, black veins.
Therefore, cut each one with a cut proceeding. If, however, there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then aim at the incision of the larger of them, and the more evident.
And similarly do concerning the two veins which are in the upper lip; and indeed custom runs much with it; and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after the phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein.
However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is for the suffocations which are in the throat, and the ailment of the uvula, and the ailments of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is such that the infirm person sits between your hands in the presence of the sun; and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein; and the colour of each of them slopes towards blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize each of them; and be careful not to extend your hand too far in phlebotomizing them.
For under it are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
The three veins, however, which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those in whose phlebotomy a custom has run throughout all men.
And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Either by piercing with a broad myrtle phlebotom, or by making an incision small enough to be considered a groove, or by cutting with a knife phlebotom, and that is the Alnesil.
And this is its form.
So Alnesil is that which is suitable for the incision.
And from them are broad and narrow varieties, according to the width and constriction of the veins. The form of the myrtle phlebotom should be broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, large veins, and those containing thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotom is of smaller width, and with finer extremities.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellowish blood.
Of the phlebotomy of the Basilica vein.
The Basilica vein, which is one of these three veins, is a help to phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from illnesses that are under the throat and neck, from there following the chest, and the stomach; and it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when phlebotomizing it, to be cautious, and to be above fear from it, for there is an artery under it.
If, therefore, he errs and adds in the phlebotomist's puncture, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will occur.
Therefore it is necessary, that he not phlebotomize it with a phlebotomy-piercing instrument; rather, let him cut with a lancet.
If the Basilica vein is not clearly visible, then it is necessary to seek another vein, and to change to another, or to look for one of its branches; or to phlebotomize the brachial vein instead.
For it is indeed obvious, and cut it with the phlebotomist's lancet, as we said.
If, however, you wish to phlebotomize the same vein, then it is necessary first to constrict the arm, so that you touch the spot until you recognize the pulse location.
Then mark the spot with ink, thereafter the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the phlebotomist's lancet, as we said.
And beware that the incision does not fall a space from the artery's location.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, inflation in the spot you marked with ink, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore, avoid it.
If you see blood at the phlebotomy leaping out, like a child's urine, and it is thin, red blood, then know that it is from arterial blood.
Then quickly place your finger over it for a long space, then remove your finger.
If therefore blood is cut (for it is often cut), then tighten the arm and release it, and let the sick person beware of movement of it, and let fear be upon him.
And let him not move it for several days until it is healed.
If however the blood is not cut, and it conquers you, and there is no medicine present for you in your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
For its extremities contract, and blood is cut.
Or take the bark of the fig tree, and split it; take one half, and tie it over the place of the vein with a proper tightening, with bandage and dressings until another day.
Then if the blood is cut, it is good.
And if not, then treat it with that whose previous mention was from the place of powders that cut off the flow of blood; and the excision of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, due to the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the Fusca vein.
Phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is helpful, as it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilic vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it befits the phlebotomist that there be caution in his phlebotomy thereof, for beneath it is a nerve.
If, therefore, the phlebotomist adds in the puncture, and finds a nerve, there arises numbness in it, and the healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
And this nerve often appears to the sense.
However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle and does not show itself, then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy such that you phlebotomize the section with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
If the vein is between two nerves, then divide the vein lengthwise.
Of the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is beneficial, because it draws blood from the head, and is helpful in eye ailments.
And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you will, to phlebotomize it by pricking with an olive-wood phlebotome, or with a myrtle-wood phlebotome, because it is the safest of all veins, since there is no artery, nor nerve, beneath it. However, it is appropriate for you in phlebotomy to avoid striking the head of the muscle with the phlebotome, and to seek a gentler spot; and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first strike, so that it may be repeated with phlebotomy several times. However, perhaps it may become inflamed in some people when not phlebotomized in the first strike, but that inflammation does not harm it in any way.
Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
The quality of phlebotomy, and its accompanying occurrences, concerning which you must consider its correction.
First, you should know that phlebotomy is not performed except in the preservation of health, and its persistence, and as a precaution against the approach of illnesses.
And that phlebotomy is performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Fusca, and the Basilica.
And phlebotomy is to be performed in the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in the true spring and summer, and in Autumn and Winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the first, or on the third day, after three hours have passed.
However, phlebotomy performed in illnesses does not have a specific time; but when necessity and suitability for it arise, in the night, or the day, and in every hour, and in all time.
And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Nor should the elderly be bled who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled, regardless of the reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels beforehand with a gentle clyster, if there is a great deal of retained stool, so that the veins do not draw putrid, harmful superfluities from the intestines to the principal members during the bleeding.
Nor should a patient suffering from nausea, or one who is surfeited, or one recovering from intoxication be bled, until that is removed from them.
Nor should a sick person with dropsy.
And bleeding should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, frequent intercourse, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that weakens the body's or animal's strength.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with foods, drinks, and medications; if it is possible for him to do so.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him; or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood may become thinner.
And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third day, as we have said; and strive that his chest be evacuated that day from all evil animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear; and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and superfluity of intercourse, and similar things.
And let him have present in his seat things with which the custom of men has run in their use: from aromatics, and scents, and festivities and similar things by as much possibility as possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit upon a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one undergoing phlebotomy; afterwards, let the phlebotomist pull out his arm and rub it with his hand twice or thrice.
Then bind the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because when the constriction is unequal, or excessive in the constriction, then it hinders the flow of blood; or in its loosening, it also hinders the flow of blood.
Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the one undergoing phlebotomy rub their hands together until the veins swell and are evident to the senses.
Then the phlebotomist should wipe the incision with a little old oil, properly.
Then he should place his left index finger lightly on the vein itself, under the spot where he intends to make the incision, so that the vein does not move away and the incision is not missed.
Because some veins are like a fleeing chord during phlebotomy: and some are full of airiness; and when you place the incision on them, they contract under the incision, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the incision does not open the vein; and if he does open it, it is narrow.  Therefore, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm and careful in all these matters.
Then he should withdraw the incision.
And if not, then repeat it another time slightly below or above that place with haste, if the place is not already inflamed.
If, however, it becomes inflamed, or the patient weakens, then let him rest for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage.
For perhaps it will attract a hot inflammation.
Nor should he enter a bath.
Then he should repeat the phlebotomy, if he wishes.
If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that not enough of the desired quantity will be removed from the blood, then repeat the phlebotomy in the same opening, straight on, and add a little to the procedure.
And do it quickly, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place occurs in many people with a minor operation.
If therefore you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat it on it at all, for it will not excuse anything in your eyes. And place something of the dregs of oil upon it, because it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies, through which phlebotomies veins at the prohibition of the flow of blood: and the Tyrians, Alfarach, and Sagzenea do it, when one of them is placed on the site.
For blood is made thinner and resolved, when it is thick.
If a large abscess occurs at the site of the phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist except on that occasion, or if the opening of the vein is small, then quickly place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed for a short time, on the site, and compress it for an hour, because it dissolves.
And it is necessary to do this after the blood has exited the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
And very often abscesses and prominences occur at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Therefore, place your hand upon it; then, if you find softness upon your compression of it, then that prominence is bad.
Therefore, beware to put something upon it from that which we said.
For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster to it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary to extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of its virtue.
And what appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it turns red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then let it go out until it becomes thin; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the vein's phlebotomy be enlarged and the phlebotomist be wide; and in one who is weak, it should be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary to extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow; and better that is administered in vein phlebotomy is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from blood flow and from nerve incision; and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
And to whom fainting is accustomed to occur during bloodletting, it is necessary that he eat beforehand a little bread soaked in pomegranate-seed water, or secaniabin, if it is heated; and extract from his blood in three or four stages.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take beforehand bread soaked in the syrup of miua, or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or in aromatic scented syrup.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting, and the cause of it is the excessive outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he drink water of meat, and a subtle scented syrup; and use aromatics with algalia, and let his chest be lined with it; and let him use the rest that we have said in the division on fainting in the chapter on evacuation.
However, whoever wants to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time, it is necessary for one whose bloodletting is due to much evacuation and whose strength is weak, to release the blood gradually according to their strength in successive days.
However, whoever wants to evacuate their arm and release their blood a second time, and whose body is strong, then let them do it after seven or nine hours from their first bloodletting.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from their body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary that they be evacuated on the second or third day.
In whose body, however, there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causing fever to occur, it is necessary that blood depart from it in one turn, and a great quantity be drawn out of it; and the opening be enlarged until fainting occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and so that you place your hand upon his pulse at the passage of the blood, lest death occur in place of fainting.
For it often happens that, when the bloodletter does not know, and negligence falls.
And it is not appropriate, when you wish to release the arm and release blood a second time, when the vein's opening is already closed and the blood's exit is difficult, to press upon it forcefully and quickly extend or flex it.
For that is very bad; indeed, leave it until it is bled a second time.
Or remove with sharpness the clotted blood from the vein's opening, and place some dissolved salt in water upon it.
And place upon it something from tyriaca alfaroch or sagzenea, and apply gentle pressure until blood emerges.
If however the vein is already suppurated, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess subsides.
If necessity provokes you to draw blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either bleed the patient above that place or in another vein of another arm.
The arm's vein, however, is bled at the location of the Fusca and Basilica veins, if these are not found, and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
And the quality of the bloodletting is such that the patient should immerse their hand in warm water until the skin reddens and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Then it should be tied above it with a ligature of moderate tightness.
Then bleed along the vein's transverse direction gradually, not laterally, nor longitudinally: and let the opening be wide, and let your incision for the bloodletting be above the joint of the hand for a short while.
And indeed, the flow of blood is mostly placed in warm water during the time of winter.
And bloodletting of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.
Bloodletting of the Saluatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.
And the quality of its bloodletting is such that you should tie the mahason of the hand with a ligature, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly evident to the senses.
Then cut the vein across.
And if you cut it entirely, it will not harm him in any way.
And be careful not to sever your hand with the lancet.
For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood clots in the vein's opening and is prevented from flowing.
When you have extracted the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt upon the vein: so that it does not quickly solidify.
And similarly it is necessary to do with every constricted branch.
The benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it is helpful for ailments of the spleen; and similarly do in its phlebotomy, as you did in the second equally.
The benefit of saphenous phlebotomy is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the uterus, and the retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys, and old sores of the hips and legs, and similar ailments.
And the method of his phlebotomy is that the sick person should put his foot in warm water, and do friction upon it, until the veins are prominent; and tie above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
And indeed the vein's location is near the heel, appearing towards the toe; and from it branches many branches on the front of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or at the heel in its aggregation, because it is better and safer.
If you phlebotomize it on the front of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are under it on the front of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy, by which you phlebotomize it transversely, as if you wish to cut it; and let the phlebotomist be Nesil.
If, however, the outflow of blood is prohibited, then repeatedly immerse his foot in warm water; and let the blood run into it, until it is evacuated.
If the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then he should repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
And similarly with the Saphena of the other foot equally.
The Sciatic vein's location, as we said, is at the heel on the wild side.
And the relief of phlebotomy is for it, for the pain of the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should enter a bath and hurry; and he should bind his leg from the side of the hip up to the heel by four fingers with a long thin strip: for it does not appear except because of that.
Therefore, when it appears, then let the phlebotomist cut it according to whatever skill is possible to you, either transversely; and it is better, or to cut it with an incision, or to divide it by a section.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
If, however, you do not find it, and it does not appear at all to the senses: then let the phlebotomist cut some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear; and beware of nerves, and make the blood flow in the quantity you wish.
Then loosen the constriction, and place a skin over the phlebotomy site, and bind the place.
For it heals quickly.
Concerning cupping, and the quality of its use.
Chapter XCVIII.
Cupping is done from horns, and from air, and from glass.
And cupping indeed is done according to two methods.
With scarification, and the extraction of blood; and the other is cupping without scarification. And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Or indeed it is with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And cupping which is administered with scarification and the extraction of blood are fourteen places of the body.
Of which one is, cupping of the Alnocrati, and it is the last of the head: and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck: and cuppings of the Alhagdahim, and they are two sheets of the neck on both sides together: and cuppings of the mentum, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and cuppings of the two shoulder blades: and cuppings of the Alachosos on the end of the tail: and cuppings of the two armpits, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and cuppings of the two thighs: and cuppings of the two calves.
And cupping indeed does not extract blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that no virtue is lost from them, as is the case with venesection.
Nor should cupping, whether with fire or without fire, be administered in any illness arising from fullness until the whole body is emptied.
If necessity prompts cupping from illness or because of custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
That is because there are people who, when blood multiplies in them until they need its extraction by cupping, experience heaviness and a feeling of pressure in their head.
And among them are those who experience fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And among them are those who experience itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And among them are those who scratch the site of their cupping. And among them are those whose laughter increases.
And among them are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue becomes ulcerated and they spit blood.
And among them are those whose sleep increases.
And among them are those who see in their dreams blood and redness, and slain persons, and wounds, and things similar to them. Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the third middle of the month, we order the application of a wind instrument to be made after two or three hours have passed during the day. The benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that it contributes to relieving heaviness in the head and what flows to the eyes.
