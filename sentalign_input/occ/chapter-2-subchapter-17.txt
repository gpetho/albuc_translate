Chapter XVII.
On the incision of alguazardenic and of what grows from flesh attached in the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some people, red flesh grows and covers the pupil, or it approaches or presses on the eyelids and firmly closes the eyelids from the outside and resembles a pomegranate flower.
But the operation is that the patient places their head on your lap; then you open their eyes and gather all that flesh with appropriate hooks, hold it with a forceps or tweezers; then cut the flesh at the beginning until everything is finished with a knife, and be careful not to damage the eye during the operation.
And let your incision with which you cut be done either with the fine instrument we mentioned in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors which are adapted according to the form of what is described in this chapter.
Then, when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, fill the eye with crushed salt, or drip into it red powder similar to corrosive medicines, and place cotton soaked in egg white over the eye until it is safe from ulceration.
If there remains any cause of alguazardenic and you fear a serious ulcer, leave the eye and treat the ulcer with what heals that ulcer, then repeat the operation until it is healed, and similarly treat the flesh attached to the eye of this kind.
However, you must avoid any treatment of the delicate eye either naturally or accidentally with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the part can endure that operation.
