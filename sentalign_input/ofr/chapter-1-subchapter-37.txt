of the kidney disease
When kidney pain comes from cold, and from great flatulence, and there is no desire for a woman, then you must make cauteries on the kidneys on one side and the other with the key-shaped cautery that we have mentioned before;
and if we cauterize it in the middle, it will have three cauteries in a line, and they will do more good.
