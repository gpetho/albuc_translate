of the cough
When the cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the patient has no fever or dryness, and the illness is chronic, make two cauteries on the chest in empty places;
and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cautery, which is called "clavile," be according to the form described previously.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking, with the cautery called "points," the form of which is described above in the section on ear diseases;
and let the pricks be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
Afterwards, treat the area as described previously, and let the cautery have three prongs according to this form:
And for this reason, the cauteries are easier because you make three at a time.
