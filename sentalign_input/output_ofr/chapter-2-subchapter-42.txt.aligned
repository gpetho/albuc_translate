Many times these abscesses occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they appear elsewhere on the body, and are numerous, and are connected to each other.	Tumours of this kind often occur in the neck and in the axilla and in the groin; and sometimes in other parts of the body.	0.7858139
And each scrophulous swelling is properly within its membrane, like the node and the abscess of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrophulous swellings are many.	Those occurring in the neck are sometimes single and sometimes multiple, one arising from another; and each scrofula is contained in a capsule of its own, like the cysts and tumours of the head that we have described.	0.7005685
There are some that contain moisture, and there are also malignant ones that do not respond to healing.	There are many kinds of these glands; some are stony, some contain humidities, some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.	0.67635703
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and this prevents you from working, put ground vitriol in the wound, or some powders that staunch blood, and compress the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and begins to suppurate.	If you cut a vein or artery and be thus hindered in your operating, apply powdered vitriol or some styptic powder to the wound, and bandage the wound and let be till the worst of the swelling has subsided and the opening is relaxed and threatens to turn purulent; for then the bleeding will stop.	0.8560053
And when the blood is stanched, then return to your work, until you have completed it; then search with your index finger if there remain any small scrophulous swellings, then cut and clean them.	Then return to your operation and finish it. Then feel with your forefinger to see if there are any small glands left, in which case dissect and clean them away.	0.74534476
And if at the root of the scrophulous swelling there is a large vein, you should not cut this swelling at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm; then fill the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.	If there is a large blood-vessel at the root of the gland, then you should not cut that gland at its root but should ligature it with a strong double ligature and leave it till it sloughs away of its own accord without harm. Then pack the wound with cotton wool previously soaked in Egyptian ointment; then continue dressing.	0.81087565
And if you cut the whole scrophulous swelling, then you must bring the two edges of the wound together, and sew them immediately, since nothing superfluous has remained due to the size of the swelling. you must therefore aim to cut the root of it, and pull it out, and sew it as we have said.	If you excise the whole gland, you should at once draw together the two edges of the wound and suture them, when you are absolutely certain there is nothing of it left. But if you see that, on account of the size of the scrofula, there is still some superfluity left behind, you should carry the incision to the root and base of it, and employ suturing and the rest of the remedies mentioned.	0.771593
you must therefore aim to cut the root of it, and pull it out, and sew it as we have said. Those scrophulous swellings which contain excess fluid, pierce them where they appear ripe; and pierce them like the aforementioned one, downwards, then administer tents with ointment and similar things, so that it dissolves what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleaned, treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.	But if you see that, on account of the size of the scrofula, there is still some superfluity left behind, you should carry the incision to the root and base of it, and employ suturing and the rest of the remedies mentioned. The glands that contain humidities you should open with a single perforation where they seem to have matured; make your perforation from below, as we have said. Then after opening use swabs soaked in Egyptian and similar ointments to do away with the unhealthy remains, till you see that the wound is clean; then dress with nourishing ointments until healed.	0.816958
