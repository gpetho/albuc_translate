On the reduction of shoulder dislocation.
Chapter 27.
Know that the shoulder is dislocated only in three ways.
One of these is that it dislocates downward toward the side of the armpit.
The second is that it dislocates toward the chest.
And sometimes it dislocates to the upper part of the shoulder: and this occurs rarely.
And it does not dislocate backward, because of the shoulder blade.
And it does not dislocate forward, because of the nerves.
And indeed, it most often dislocates and exits downward toward the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh.
For it exits from them quickly and re-enters quickly.
However, in those with much flesh, the opposite is true, namely, it exits with difficulty and re-enters with difficulty.
And sometimes, a blow or fall happens to certain people, and the shoulder is inflamed with a hot abscess, and because of this it is thought that it has been dislocated.
Therefore, you should examine it until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
And the dislocation is recognized when it is downward toward the armpit, and you can distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy shoulder.
For you will find a clear difference between them, and you will find a concavity at the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit, upon touch, the head of the shoulder feels almost like an egg: and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear or move it in all motions.
And similarly, if it dislocates toward the chest or upward, then you find it clearly by touch, nor is it hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is indeed easy when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
And its reduction is achieved by the assistant raising his hand upward.
Then place your thumbs under his armpit, and lift the joint forcefully upward to its place, and the assistant raises his hand and extends it upward.
Then place it downward, for it returns quickly.
But if it does not return by what we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary for the patient to bathe in warm water, and to receive an ointment that softens and soothes, as if the roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water and applied.
Then the patient should lie on his back, and a sphere and wool, balanced between softness and firmness, should be placed under his armpit.
Then the physician places his heel on the sphere, lifts the head of the shoulder with force, and pulls the patient's hand downward.
And another assistant holds the patient’s head so that it does not move downward, for it returns immediately.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: have a taller man than the patient stand at the side, insert his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift his armpit upward until the patient is suspended in the air.
And another assistant should pull the patient’s hand downward toward his abdomen.
But if the patient is light, then something else should be suspended with him to weigh him down, for the dislocation will return immediately.
And it is also reduced according to another method: this is, a long piece of wood is fixed in the ground, with a rounded head in shape, like the handle of a mortar, which should be neither thick nor thin.
Then, after placing soft cloths over the head of the wood, it is positioned under the patient, who should stand along the length of the wood.
Then his hand is stretched downward on one side, and his body is extended from the other side with strength, for the joint quickly returns to its place.
But if its reduction is difficult with everything we have described, then use this method: take a piece of wood with a length equal to two forearms, a width of four fingers, and a thickness of two fingers, with a rounded head to ease its entry into the depth of the armpit, according to this shape.
Then tie soft cloths over the rounded head so that the wood does not harm the patient.
Then place it under the patient’s armpit so that his hand or arm stretches downward over the wood, and the wood is tied over the support, arm, and the end of the hand.
Then place the arm over the width of a step of a ladder, extend the hand downward, and let the rest of the body be suspended from the other side.
For the joint re-enters immediately.
When its re-entry is thus completed by whatever means possible, then it is necessary to place a sphere of equal size made of wool under the armpit.
Then apply a plaster prepared from mill dust with frankincense and egg white over the whole shoulder, as it is wrapped above.
Then secure it under the armpit with an appropriate bandage, wrap the ligament over the plaster, and fasten his hand to his neck, leaving it unmoved for seven days.
And it is necessary to keep the patient’s food light until the limb is strengthened, for it aids its healing more quickly.
Then after seven or five days, a larger amount may be given, and it should be exercised with motion.
If it thus becomes firm and does not soften, then it is healed.
But if the joint dislocates many times, due to humidity affecting it or for another reason, then it is necessary to apply cautery with three openings, as mentioned previously in the chapter on cautery.
If all this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint does not become stable, and the plaster and bandage are reapplied over it multiple times, and it does not stabilize, and it falls and cannot be lifted upward, then you should know that the nerves attached to the head of the shoulder are now either severed, stretched, or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The reduction of a dislocation that occurs toward the chest and breast or to the back is done with pressure and extension with the hands until it returns, and the remaining bandage and care is applied to it until it heals.
If, after healing, heaviness in the limb occurs and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use the bath frequently, until that heaviness is lessened and it returns to its original nature.
