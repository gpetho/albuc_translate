on the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes displaced, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inward and outward.
The sign is that the ankle is swollen and sticks out in the part where it is dislocated:
The repositioning is easy, and it should be gently stretched by hand when it is only displaced.
And when it is completely dislocated, you should make the patient sit upright, and a strong assistant should hold the leg above the ankle;
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left hand twice, then stretch it upwards, and gently push the foot upwards;
And do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot; if it returns, that's good; if not, then repeat the process, as it will return;
And if it cannot return this way, then lay the patient on their back on the ground, and fix a post firmly in the ground between their thighs, and wrap it with cloths so it does not hurt the patient;
Then the assistant holds the thigh, and another assistant extends the foot by hand or with a strap tied around the ankle;
Then each assistant stretches equally, and the post remains between the patient's thighs to hold the patient when stretching;
Then the practitioner sets the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant holds the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is set, apply a plaster and cotton on it, and bind it tightly, and tie the foot to the leg, and ensure that the nerves behind the ankle are not too constricted;
Then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage loosens, tighten it; then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days;
And if he walks before that time, there is no certainty that it will not dislocate again.
And if a hot abscess occurs, it is necessary to soothe it, as we have said elsewhere, until it is healed.
