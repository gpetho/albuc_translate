The forty-second chapter on the incision on the scrofulas that appear in the neck.
These tumors frequently occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins, and they may occur throughout the body.
Those that occur in the neck can be single or multiple.
And some of them arise from others.
And each scrofulous tumor (khanazira) is within its own membrane, as is the case with hernias and head tumors, as we have described.
And the types of these scrofulous tumors are many: some are hardened, some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
So, if I find one of them that feels good to the touch, and its appearance is close to the color of the skin, and it moves in every direction, and it is not attached to a nerve of the neck, nor to a vein, nor to an artery, and it is not deep, then it should be incised with a simple incision from top to bottom of the growth in this manner, from line C to line B.
And skin it from every side, and stretch the lips of the skin with a hook or with two hooks, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we said regarding head tumors, and extract it little by little, and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve.
And let the scalpel not be very sharp, lest your hand cuts more, or the patient moves, so you cut what you don't need to cut.
If you cut a vein or an artery and it hinders you from working, then put in the wound crushed vitriol or some of the powders that stop the blood, and tighten the wound and leave it until the intensity of the tumor subsides, the wound relaxes and starts to suppurate, then the blood will stop then, so return to your work until you are finished.
Then search with your index finger, if other small tumors remained, then cut them and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the base of the tumor, then it is appropriate not to cut that tumor from its base, but it is appropriate to tie it with a doubled tight thread and leave it until it falls by itself without harm, then fill the wound with worn cotton having dipped it in the Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the whole tumor, then it is appropriate to bring together the lips of the wound and sew it immediately after you know that no excess remains at all, but if you see that some excess remains due to the size of the tumor, then you should aim to cut it to its origin and base, and use stitching and what we mentioned.
And for tumors that contain fluids, poultice them with a simple poultice where their ripeness appears to you, and make the poultice from the lower part, as we said, then after the poultice, use the wick with the Egyptian ointment and the like to eat away what remains of the corruption, until you see the wound has become clean, then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth until it heals.
