Of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the joints of the fingers, fractures rarely occur, and most often it is just a dislocation.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or dislocated, the patient should sit cross-legged, and sit upright; then place their hand on a stretched cloth, and the assistant stretches the fractured bones, and the physician sets them evenly, until they are well joined; then apply the poultice and the padding, if no abscess forms, then place a splint according to the size of the area; and wrap it in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the underside around the palm, then make a pad of cloths, and instruct the patient to press it against the fractured palm; then bind it with a long cloth, and the splint should be soft wood as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as needed.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you should place a splint on top and another underneath the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and secure the binding between the fingers.
And if the fracture is at any of the finger joints, if it is the thumb, set it evenly, as needed; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to stabilize the fracture, and prevent movement; and if the fracture is on other fingers, like the index or another, set it evenly, and bind it with the healthy finger next to it; or bind them all together as one, which is better, or place a splint, as on the thumb; and monitor the restoration and the development of a hot abscess, and treat what arises, as I have said.
