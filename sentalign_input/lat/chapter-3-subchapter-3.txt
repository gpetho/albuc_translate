On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Chapter IV.
Know that only two upper parts of the nose can break together, or one of them: this is because it consists of two bones, since the lower part is cartilage, it does not break, but only suffers abrasion, twisting, and bending.
If one of its two parts is broken, then you should insert your little finger into the nasal cavity and align the fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and this should be done skillfully, with ease.
And be careful that no pain is caused to the patient by your operation.
But if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, then it should be aligned with the end of a rod, which has a small thickness.
If the fracture is in both parts, then do the same: and hasten to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
If not, then after the seventh or tenth day, when the swelling has calmed.
Then insert into the end of the nose a linen strip if the fracture is in one part, or two strips if the fracture is in both parts: and let the strip have enough thickness to fill the nasal cavity.
And some of the restorers of old have said that the strips should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
However, this does not seem advisable to me; rather, the strip should be soaked in egg white, prepared with millstone powder.
Then leave the strip in place until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens.
Sometimes, instead of a strip, a goose feather wrapped with a soft cloth is inserted into the nose, which holds the nasal fracture more firmly and does not prevent the patient from breathing.
But this is not necessary.
If you wish, do this; or if you wish, use the strips.
If, while you are operating, the nose becomes swollen, then plaster the nose with cerate, or with cotton soaked in rose oil, or a little diachylon.
If no swelling occurs, then you should plaster it with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white.
Then place soft tow on it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
If the nasal bones are fractured into small pieces or are crushed, then you must make an incision over them and extract them with suitable instruments.
Then suture the incision, and treat it with something that encourages flesh growth and consolidates it, using suitable plasters or ointments.
If a wound occurs between the nose, then it should be treated with strips, and a lead tube should be used until it heals.
