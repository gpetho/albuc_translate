Chapter Five:
On the Cauterization of Ear Pain
When pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with laxative measures and other treatments described in the section, and the pain persists, then ignite the cautery iron, which is called "puncta", of which this is the form:
Then mark close to the ignition, and move it around the entire ear as if revolving a wheel, or in the circuit of each segment if the pain is in each one.
Extend yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear little by little after marking the spot with a probe.
If the cautery has ten points in the entire ear, or nearly so, treat the spots until they are healed.
