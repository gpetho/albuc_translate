Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and fold them back between the healthy tooth, and place it so that it does not injure the tongue; and then leave it tightened as long as it can stay, and if it comes loose, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread; it will remain and serve thus for all its time, and this is the shape of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of the two healthy teeth, and of the two loose ones, as you see:	Then with the scissors cut off the two ends of the wire remaining over, and bring them together and twist them with forceps and hide them between a sound tooth and a loose tooth so as to not injure the tongue; then for the future leave them thus bound. But if it comes undone or breaks, bind them with another wire; so may he have the use of them all his life. This is a figure of the teeth and the manner of interlacing two sound and two loose teeth, as you see. After one or two teeth have fallen out they may be restored to their place and bound in as instructed, and become permanent.	0.90503526
And when the tooth falls out, it is put back in its place, immediately, as we have said; and let no one interfere who is not wise and experienced, and sometimes a tooth is made from cow bone, and it is put in the place where the defect is, and it is secured as we have said, and remains and serves thus for a long time.	This can be done only by an expert and gentle practitioner. Sometimes a piece of ox-bone may be carved and made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the site where a tooth was lost, and fastened as we have said, and it will last and he will get long service from it.	0.736237
