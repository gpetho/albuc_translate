On a windy rupture.
Chapter 66.
In this rupture, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with surgery.
And the first ones indeed said that it is done as we described in the rupture that involves the scrotum.
That is, to tie the vessels below the section with ease: then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with what opens it until the vessels fall away: and treat the wound, as we said, until it is healed.
