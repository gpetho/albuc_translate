And if blood flows from them, cauterize with a delicate lenticular cautery, and cauterizing after the incision is very effective; and many times they recur if any part of their roots remains; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burnt and do not return.	If there is bleeding from them, cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery. Cauterization of them after excision is best, for they often return when a part of their roots is left behind; but when they are cauterized the roots are burnt and they will not come back.	0.8403808
