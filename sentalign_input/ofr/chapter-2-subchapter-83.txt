of the form of the clyster
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or tin, or cast or hammered brass;
and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, depending on to whom they are administered.
Those then which are administered in the treatment of children, and who are weak and suffering, are small.
The form of the clyster, small and large, is wider at the top, where the belly is tied, in this way:
and there should be a separation where the belly is tied, as you see, and the bottom should be pierced;
and it has two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and the belly, where the medicines are put, should be made of an animal bladder or parchment, and pierced all around with small holes, and there should be a finger's width between each hole, then put a strong thread of raw flax, twisted tenfold or around it into these holes, and gather the belly like a goat's udder;
and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument at the front with a strong thread, then administer the clyster;
and this is the shape of the circle:
And the medicine should be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the tip of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently;
then the practitioner squeezes it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then withdraws the clyster, and the patient raises their legs against the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, they hold it in as long as they can;
and if they sleep a whole night with it, it is even more helpful.
And if you give a clyster for diarrhea, and the medicine comes out quickly, repeat it until they are healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or an abscess, the clyster should be as thin as for a child;
and this is the form of the thin clyster for when the leather is tight:
