of leprosy
Lepers are sometimes greatly helped by cautery, and especially those illnesses that come from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it to be cauterized, take care if the illness is at the beginning, and if it is treated according to what we have said in the division, and neither descends nor remains, and you fear that the corruption will take hold of the whole patient, then make five cauteries on the head:
One in the middle of the head to the occiput, and the other towards the forehead at the hairline;
and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and press your hand so that the cautery reaches the bone, and so that the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize it on the spine according to what is described before.
And if the measles are spread everywhere;
and it is clearly evident, then you must cauterize it with these cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the bridge of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and another next to it, and two on the two shoulders;
and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the breast, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the back heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one makes a cautery on the wrist bone, and another on the breastbone, and another on the liver. 
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give, and the more it benefits him;
and know that the sick person does not feel pain from the cautery as the healthy feel it, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And the cauteries must be large and small according to the limbs and joints, depending on how you find it in the types of irons.
Afterward, treat the area with vetch flour with honey and other treatments until it is healthy.
