Chapter Sixty-Six.
On the varicose vein.  This varicose vein, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described for the vein that is with the scrotum, that is, that the vessels should be tied gently below, after the incision on them.
Then it is incised in the middle, and the swelling is treated with what opens it until the vessels fall off, and the wound is treated as we mentioned until it heals.
