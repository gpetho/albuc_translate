If there occurs in the ear pain from cold. And it is treated with laxatives and all the other treatments that we mentioned in the division, and the pain does not go away. Then heat the cautery iron that is called "the point," which is of this form:	When the ear gets a pain from the cold and is treated with laxatives and other medicine as mentioned in its section and the pain nevertheless persists, heat the cautery termed 'punctate'.	0.7725185
Then you apply drops with it, after heating it, around the entire ear as you go around, or around both of them if the pain is in both. And you keep the cautery a little away from the base of the ear, after you mark the place with ink.	Then after it has been heated prick with it in a circle right round the ear, or around both if there is pain in both, after the place has been marked with ink; the cauterizations being a little away from the ear.	0.89102566
And the cautery should be the size of ten dots in each ear, or about that.	Let the cauterization be of ten punctures or thereabouts round each.	0.71170807
