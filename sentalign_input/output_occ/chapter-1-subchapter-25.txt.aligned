On the cauterization of the titillic, which is the head of the shoulder.	On cauterization of the axilla.	0.5066732
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to slippery humidity and it is not fixed at the time of its return to its usual position, and with a small movement it dislocates again, as we have observed, then you must first reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be laid on their back or on their healthy side; and then raise the tendon that is in the inner part of the shoulder to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inward.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated on account of the synovial fluid or when it does not remain in the correct position after the dislocation has been set, so that this becomes a regular occurrenceâ€”it is set and then dislocates with the least movement, as we have ourselves seen; you must first set the luxation, then make the patient lie down on his back or on his sound side; then with the fingers of the left hand lift up the skin of the axilla if the joint has dislocated downwards.	0.848174
And then heat the cautery with two heads; and this is the form:	Then heat a cautery provided with two spits in this manner.	0.6396271
And then cauterize the tendon until it penetrates into the other side; and the figure of the cauterization will then have four heads of the cauteries.	Then with that burn through the fold of skin till you have perforated to the other side, getting four cauterizations. The cautery may be of three prongs and then the form of the cauterization will be six burns.	0.77221215
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this calculation and therefore there are eight cauteries.	Sometimes there is added yet one more so there will be eight burns.	0.59023833
And then place cooked salt on the cautery, and then make the patient rest in tranquility, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is strengthened.	Put on the burns leeks well pounded with salt; then keep the patient absolutely quiet so as not to move the joint for a time till it gains strength.	0.8023475
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done later, then cauterize on the muscle with a pointed cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is confirmed and the humidity is removed and the patient is healed.	If the dislocation has gone upwards, which very rarely happens, then cauterize him above the shoulder with one good claviform cautery or with multiple punctured cauterizations. Thus the joint will gain strength and the humidity will disappear and the patient will be cured.	0.760491
