of the flesh that grows in the eye
This illness which is below, which is truly called "axacrati," and is natural and accidental.
The accidental comes from wounds and fissures and cauterization and similar things; and the method of working on it is that you take a needle, which has a double thread, and stick it in the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out on both sides of the flesh; then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
And if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, that's good; if not, then take a scalpel and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid, and make two incisions in the side inside the eyelid; and the ends of the two incisions should be at the two angles of the incision that you have cut, and make an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the figure of a letter called "Greek I"; then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its sides are sharp underneath, following the eyelid, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a woolen thread; then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines, and with tents, until it is healed.
And if the illness comes from a fissure or a suture or cauterization, then you must make a full incision under the hairs of the eyelids, and according to what is described above; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and one should perform the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master devises a plan with all his power how to return the shape to its natural form; and the patient himself, according to what is necessary in terms of work and instruments with various arrangements.
