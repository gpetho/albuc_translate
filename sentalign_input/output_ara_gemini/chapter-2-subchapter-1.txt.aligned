This ailment often occurs to boys at birth if the midwife squeezes the boy's head without gentleness.	This disease occurs most commonly in infants upon delivery when the midwife grasps the child's head roughly.	0.80211973
It may also occur from a hidden cause that is not known.	It also sometimes happens from some hidden and unknown cause.	0.8413962
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than boys. And all of those whom I have seen with it, death came to them quickly. Therefore, I have decided to abandon treating it.	I have never seen this disease except in very small children; and death very quickly overtook all those that I have seen; therefore I have preferred not to undertake operation in these cases.	0.796873
And I have certainly seen among them a boy whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day until the boy could not sit up on his own due to the size of his head. And the moisture increased until he perished.	I have seen a child whose head was filled with fluid and daily growing in size, until the child could not sit upright on account of the size of his head, and the humidity increased till he died.	0.8491109
And this moisture either gathers between the skin and the bone, or it gathers beneath the bone on the periosteum.	Now this humidity sometimes collects between the skin and the bone; sometimes it collects beneath the bone and over the membrane.	0.7514258
And the treatment for that, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, it is necessary to make one horizontal incision in the middle of the head, and the length of the incision should be about two knuckles so that the moisture flows out.	The operation is thus: when the humidity is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, an incision should be made in the middle of the head, transversely. The length of the incision should be about two thumb-joints, so that the humidity may flow out.	0.74739206
And this is a picture of the lancet.	This is the form of the scalpel.	0.42958087
If the moisture is greater and the swelling is larger, then make it two intersecting incisions in this way:	If the humidity is more copious and the swelling greater, make two intersecting incisions to this pattern.	0.8073882
And if the moisture is under the bone	But if the humidity is beneath the bone—and the sign of that is that you will see the sutures of the skull gaping on all sides, the water manifestly yielding when you press in with your fingers—you should make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this pattern.	0.5786137
And after the incision, all the moisture comes out. Then the incisions are tightened with bandages and compresses. Then it is moistened from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.	After incising, draw out all the humidity; then bind up the incisions with pads and bandages; and over the bandages foment with wine and oil till the fifth day.	0.8360239
Then the bandage is loosened, and the wound is treated with bandages and ointments.	Then loose the bandage and dress the wound with lint and ointments.	0.8605771
And do not neglect to tighten the head moderately. And the patient is fed with all dry food, low in moisture, until the organ strengthens and heals.	And do not forget to bandage the head lightly; and feed the patient with a dry diet with little fluid, until the part is strengthened and healed.	0.8318245
Another method of incision is to look where the bone of the swelling and the accumulation of water appear.	Another pattern of incision is to see where the tumefaction and collection of fluid is apparent.	0.8492776
Because it may be more in the back of the head or in the front of it, or on the right or on the left.	For sometimes it is greater in the posterior or anterior part of the head, or to the right or to the left.	0.8950036
So you aim the incision where the swelling and the fullness of water appeared to you. So you incise it as best you can.	Therefore make your incision where the tumefaction and dropsy are apparent; incise that place in whatever way you can.	0.75085056
And be careful not to cut an artery, causing bleeding, so that the patient dies from that bleeding with the discharge of moisture.	Be careful not to cut an artery lest you cause haemorrhage and the patient die of that haemorrhage at the same time that the humidity is evacuated.	0.8540752
