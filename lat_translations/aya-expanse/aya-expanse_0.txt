Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	Having thus completed this book for you, which is the latest work on medicine with additions thereto, and having reached the end of it through his explanations and his own statements, it has seemed to me right to complete it for you with this Treatise, that is, with manual surgery.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since manual surgery is neglected in our region and entirely private in our time, until perhaps the knowledge of it has perished and its trace has been lost; and there remain from it only a few descriptions in ancient books, which have been distorted by hand, and errors and hesitations have arisen until the intentions of his art have been closed and its sight has faded: I have thought it right to revive it with the order of this Treatise according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and so to come to the forms of cautery tools and the rest of surgical instruments; with the addition of declarations and the elaboration of what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	Moreover, the reason why a good master of this art with his own hand is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is long; and it is necessary for its author to exercise himself in anatomy before he narrated what Galen did, until he knows the members' helps, their forms, their union and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, tendons, the number of them, and their exit, and the pulsations and quietness of veins and arteries, and the exits of places.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of this, Hippocrates said that the name is much with the name, and little with the work, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	Indeed, we have already spoken of him at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	For he who is not aware of what we have said about anatomy, will not succeed, but will fall into error, which harms men; as I have seen many among them who boast of this knowledge, yet lack understanding and experience in it.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	This is because I have seen a stupid physician cut into a scrofulous swelling on a woman's neck and he injured some arteries in her neck; therefore the woman's blood flowed until she died in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I have seen another physician who presumptiously tried to extract a stone from a man whose urethra had become blocked due to age, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	He therefore approached him and extracted it with a urinary probe.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Why the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And indeed I had been called to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the frailty of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician, who was receiving payment from a certain duke of our land for medicine. And there was a eunuch, black, who was with him; he had a fracture in his thigh near the calcaneum. The physician, through his ignorance, squeezed the fracture over the wound with lint and stitches, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he released him according to his wishes.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards, he released him after a few days and ordered him not to loosen the ligature. And he remained in that condition until his leg and foot were gangrened, and he came to his end.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	So I was called to him, and I hurried to loosen the ligature; then peace came, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption was already confirmed in the member; and I could not stop it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	So, as the corruption ceased to spread in the member, it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician, who was probing the cancerous abscess; and after a few days, it became infected until the evil of the disease increased with its owner's condition.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	This is because when the cancer is pure from a melancholy humor, then it should not be approached with iron at all unless it is in a member that can tolerate it so that the whole of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of that, children, it is necessary for you to know that surgery, when divided with the hand, is divided into two parts: namely, the operation associated with health, and the operation where there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already discussed at length in every section of this book where the operation lies that carries fear and trepidation.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to be careful and cautious so that you do not find foolish ways to speak and dishonor yourselves.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, take care with caution and protection, and tend to your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading to grace from God for a commendable salvation and succession; and let go of terrible afflictions difficult to heal; and free your minds from what makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter into your faith and advantage.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it remains more for your glory, and higher in this world, and finally for the extent of your power.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galen indeed has already said in some of his precepts.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness; do not call yourself a bad doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have, however, divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	**First Chapter**
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	On cauterization with fire and acute medicine, this chapter deals with the forms and arrangement from head to foot, and the shapes of surgical instruments and cautery tools, as well as everything necessary for the procedure.
Capitulum secundum.	**Second Chapter**
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	On section and perforation, phlebotomy and venesection, and wounds: the extraction of arrows and similar foreign bodies, and all the chapter is arranged according to the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	**Third Chapter**
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	On restoration, dislocation, and treatment of torsion, and similar conditions, this chapter is arranged from head to foot according to the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	**Albucasis' Surgical Textbook**
Pars I.	**Part I:**
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On healing and damage from cauterization: what types of wounds it is suitable for, and when; and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	**Chapter I**
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before we proceed with the description of operations, it is necessary to speak of the qualities of healing and damaging factors, and in what types of wounds they manifest.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore that discourse on the quality of cauterization and its damage is lengthy and subtle, a knowledge and hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Many learned men have also spoken on this topic and disagreed; for me, however, a brief summary of their statements is sufficient, lest I prolong the discussion.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore that cautery applies universally to every type of wound that involves matter or lacks it; excepting two types of wounds, which are the hot wound without matter and the dry wound without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, there is disagreement between them regarding the hot and dry wound with matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some said that cautery is beneficial for those wounds.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the contrary to him, namely that cautery is not suitable for a disease arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat, and it is unsuitable for healing from a hot and dry disease with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the contrary to him replied: "Cautery is a remedy for every hot and dry disease that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its humors to the fire's complexion, you find the human body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself say by his words: for I have already tested it several times from experience.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, one should not approach it unless they have already been tested and practiced in the final chapter of cautery, and have understood the variety of human complexions, the disposition of diseases within themselves, their causes, the events that befall them, and the space of time for their duration.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	From the other complexions, there is no need for fear, especially in cold and wet diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For indeed all doctors have agreed upon these things, and they do not disagree on the use of cautery for them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, my children, that from the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and the goodness of it over cautery with medicated substances, is because fire is simple, whose action does not reach unless to the member to be cauterized, and it does not harm another member joined with it, unless in a slight way.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of medicine that fights against disease indeed reaches that which is stretched out from the body part, and perhaps causes difficulty in healing the disease in the body part, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not cause it (damage) unless it becomes excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Indeed, through experience, because of the length of service and study with art, and the focus on the truth of things, and because of that, I am excusing the length of this speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if not, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I will present to you a hidden secret about fire, and the quality of its operation in expelling bodies, by which it expels diseases through philosophical discourse, sharpened by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, children, that they disagree in the time when it comes to making cautery, and they set a better time for the wound.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is appropriate in every time: because the damage caused by chance through time is submerged in the healing brought about with cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if cauterization is for necessary pains from strong, urgent pains that do not tolerate delay: because it is feared from them that a greater harm will occur than the slight damage caused by time's passing.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let not that notion fall into your minds, O sons, which they do not appreciate, except for common and stupid doctors; namely, that the illness which is healed by cauterization does not always return: and they attribute its consequences, and the matter is not as they think. For cauterization is only where medicine alters the complexion and dries up the humidities which are the causes of pains.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization exceeds medicine in the speed of its healing, and the strength of its operation, and the certainty of its mastery; and it is possible that the illness returns after a certain time according to the complexion of the patient, and the location of his illness, and its strength; and what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities in him. And it comes to itself in acquiring its causes from food and similar things, unless an illness occurs in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in a member due to a few superfluities and humidities, such as cauterization on a tooth because of pain and similar things, is possible; for it may not return in that place the same pain.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens rarely.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	In truth, the common opinion that cauterization is the last resort of medicine is a correct statement; not what they intend by it, for they believe there is no cure that can be achieved with medicine or any other means after the opportunity for cauterization has passed.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the contrary is true; the cautery is the last resort of medicine, not unless when we apply methods of treatment to certain illnesses and they do not help, then we apply cautery at the end, which brings about relief. Thus, what is meant by the cautery being the last resort of medicine, according to popular understanding and many physicians, is false.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	However, they said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this unless because of the equality of gold and the subtlety of its substance; and they said that cautery does not cause pus in the wound.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	That is not entirely true; for I have already tested it and found that it does not work the same way in all bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cautery with gold itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you use fire cautery with gold over fire according to the amount you desire because of the redness of gold, and if it is heated too much, it melts in the fire and turns into layers.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the artisan falls from that work and because of it, cautery with iron becomes more convenient and closer to us, as a result of its suitability for practice.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have indeed now arranged this Chapter on Wound Care, according to the chapters: and I have ordered them from head to foot, so that he who seeks anything from it may find it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	**On the Method of Cauterization for the Forehead at the Temple Joint.**
Caput II.	**Head II.**
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	**Herein is described the cauterization that rules over moisture and coldness upon the brain: these two are causes of fever, and the great flow of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and the abundance of sleep, and toothache, and throat pain, and in general all illness arising from coldness, such as paralysis, fever, epilepsies, apoplexies, and similar illnesses.**
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	**The method of cauterization is as follows: first, you must persuade the patient: to purge the head thoroughly with a cleansing medicine three or four nights in succession, according to the condition of the patient's strength, age, and habits.**
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	**Then instruct him to make incisions on his head with a razor.**
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	**Then have him sit between your hands in such a way that he has already placed his hands on his chest.**
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of your nose between your eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Whenever therefore your middle finger touches it, mark that place with an unhealed wound.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then use a cautery with oil: which has this form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place the same on the marked place with an unhealed wound, gradually lowering your hand, and you will turn it around.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly withdraw your hand, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	Which if you see has now removed from the bone the amount of the skull or the amount of the zinc, then withdraw your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the same iron or another until you see the bones that I have told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then add some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak the cloth in it, then place it on the place, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the cloth soaked in butter on top of it, and leave it over the place until the scar from the fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then it is treated with a four-ingredient ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They also said that the deeper and more open the wound remains, the more pus it emits; therefore, it is better and more curable.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized from the mouth to the anus; and hold the cautery until something thick from the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is smoothed after what is burned from the bone, then it is treated.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to use a cautery until it leaves an impression in the bone so deep that the tooth falls out, which is done like a horn; or an instrument that women put into their vulvas when giving birth: and they think that vapors from this place are exhaled through the open wound over time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated until it solidifies.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	However, these two types of cautery do not at all appear to me except in some people according to their fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it alone is better for my health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head becomes weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity, as we have witnessed in the other members, and especially when the head is naturally weak and feeble, then the first species of cautery is more healthy and better for me, and I use it in my operations to preserve health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Regarding the method of cauterizing the head when it is in pain throughout the head.
Caput III.	Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When a chronic pain occurs throughout the head and persists, becoming severe, it is treated with herbs, poultices, hot compresses, oils, and emollients.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with one of the cauteries we have mentioned and does not benefit from them, then consider this.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the weak head is of strong constitution by nature and is not feeble, and it suddenly feels a freezing cold, then cauterize below that point with another cautery, sparingly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize the entire head with your cautery, without letting it penetrate the skin, and expose the amount from the bone as we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize the center of the head with one cautery at the place called the "vas" (a term for a blood vessel or artery), which is the place where the flow is strongest, and raise your heat upon it so that you do not expose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	The patient indeed suffers from that constant pain, as well as various pains distinct from those of the other parts of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say that this cauterization should be done in its place: and it is necessary that there be a cauterizing instrument for the horns of the head, and a milder cauterizing instrument for the back of his head, through which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	§ Regarding the cauterization of hemicrania, it should be done both with heated medicines and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When a painful and persistent sensation occurs in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is drained with purifying medicines for the head, and the remaining treatment is administered as I mentioned in the divisions of ailments, but it does not alleviate the entire condition, then cauterization should be done in that area according to two methods: either cauterization with heated medicine burning it, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	However, cauterization with heated medicine burning it involves taking a tooth from one person and its own skin, and cutting off the extremities of it on both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then, cut the place of pain with a phlebotomist's side, until a place beneath the skin where the tooth is caught, is formed.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Therefore, introduce it into the flesh itself until it is hidden; then tighten it with a delicate constriction and leave it for fifteen hours, then loosen it and extract another, and leave the wound uncovered for two or three days; afterwards, place a cloth soaked in butter on top of it until the pus has formed; finally, treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do that with certain burning medicines, as I have written in the twelfth chapter of the book on drugs, then apply them.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Indeed, cauterization with iron is done in this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The burning cautery, whose form is as follows.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called the claw cautery, because its form resembles a claw, in which there is something of curvature, and in its middle there is a small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the spot and hold your hand, and slowly turn the iron with velocity; and the amount that is cauterized should be according to the thickness of the skin, as its halfway point.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand so as not to burn the artery below, which would cause blood flow.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Next, soak the bandage in a solution of salt water and place it over the wound, leaving it for three days. Then apply butter to the bandage, and afterwards treat with ointment until healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if it be necessary, cauterize this hemicranium with the edge of a knife according to the art of cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And take care from the incision of the artery in this hemicranium, not too far or too shallow.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	§ Concerning the method of cautery in ancient hemicranium.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When treating a hemicranium, as we mentioned in the previous treatment and in the division of ailments, and if this treatment does not help: and you see that the illness does not suffice with the first cauterization with medicine or with cauterization with fire, then it is necessary to make the cautery with a knife until it turns white after marking on the site of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or something like that; and place your hand once with pressure, and tighten it until you cut the artery and reach the jaw.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to be cautious about the continuation of the jawbone, which moves during chewing, so that it does not burn the side or the nerve that moves it, from which spasm may occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this should be above all a guard and caution regarding the flow of blood from an artery that has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in cutting, there is fear, and above all to him who does not know what he is doing, and is neither studious nor expert; and he leaves the operation with that first mistake.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come to the remembrance of the regulation of the flow of blood from an artery according to its own manner and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the severity of the wound that this cautery is not sufficient for it, and you see the body tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, treat the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see, administer cautery which we said in the chapter on extracting an artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is indeed better and more effective with this method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	# On the method of cauterizing in the case of ear pain.
Caput VI.	**Head VI.**
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When ear pain occurs due to cold, and it is cured with warm compresses, and the remaining cure as we said in division, and the pain does not go away, then apply fire cautery; and that is called 'Punctum', which has this form.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then, after the ignition of the point, it is applied around the entire ear, as it has been shown; or around both ears if pain is felt in both simultaneously.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	Then, using the cauterizing iron, stretch it from the root of the ear, shortly after you have marked the site with wax; and the amount of caustic should be ten points on each ear, approximately.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then, take care of the wounds until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	§ On the method of cauterization in surgery.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The surgery which is cured by cauterization is only of certain types that occur from phlegm, according to what we have mentioned in the division of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And for the species of cauterization that occurs from desiccation and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of surgery with fire, and hot irons, and gargles, and it does not confer a cure, then you should cauterize the patient three times: first at the root of the ear, second slightly below its natural position, and third at the connection of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cauterizing instrument from the opposite side of the weaker part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not occur unless it is in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the shape of cauterization is such that you cauterize the very tip of the upper ear lobe just beneath the forehead's horn, and at another time; its length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cauterizing instrument until the amount that burns through half of the skin's thickness is consumed.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the shape of the cautery, and it's a kind of knife, whose form I've described: however, it isn't too thin as you can see; and it should be that there's a little extra thickness to the knife.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with what came before; until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	# Regarding the ancient method of cauterization for apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	**Head VIII.**
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes ancient (or when, after following the aforementioned treatments and care, your condition doesn't improve and the patient does not have a fever), then cauterize them with four cauteries over all the horns of their head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head as I've said before, and another cautery at the nape of the head, according to what came before; and the manner of cauterization should be as previously described.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	It is also cauterized with a cauterizer on the stomach's opening: and this is more ultimate.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then it is treated with what came before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	§ On the method of cauterization in oblivion.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that in the early stages of a great disease of the hip, washes that cleanse the brain be given.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then wash the entire head of the infected person, and place a plaster of cooked glue described in the treatise on plasters on their forehead, and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	The same method is cauterization itself: and it should be done according to the same order that I mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore it is cured by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then perform three cauterizations on the back part of their head, which are descending from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye, and put between each cauterization a thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for cauterization, together with what preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If, however, you wish to add to it, and the patient can endure it: then perform cauterization in the middle of it.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish to add it: then cauterize the very top over the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then care for the wound until it heals: and let cauterization be oily according to the form that has been described before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	§ Regarding the method of cauterization in paralysis and its soothing.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you proceed with the purification of the head with hair, and with what we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then carefully clean the head of the patient: afterwards, cauterize the very top with hot iron in the middle of the head, and cauterize over every horn of the head, and cauterize over the back part of it, and apply three times over the spinal bones.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If, however, you need to soothe the body from many other ailments, and the patient can endure it, and the ailment is strong: then cauterize the very top with four hot irons over the spinal bones, and finish with the last iron cauterization, until much of it is burned from the skin, and draw your hand away.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for the wound itself until it is healed, and thus apply oil as a cauterizing agent.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	**On cauterization in epilepsy.**
Caput XI.	**Chapter XI.**
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic should not be cauterized except for that whose epilepsy arises from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the surgeon to clean the brain first with cauterization and with the rest of the care that we have mentioned in division; when the patient's condition is severe or he is tolerant of accepting medications.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medications, then gargles and brain-cleansing chews are administered for many days prior, with the aid of nutritious foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then he should shave the patient's head, after which cauterize the wound with a single cautery instrument in the middle of the head, according to what was mentioned before; and another cautery on the back of his head, and over every horn of his head with cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If the patient is strong and tolerant, then he should be cauterized with the cautery instruments that I have mentioned while having paralysis, and softening of the body over the spine of the neck and the spine of the back; and the cautery should be done with oil as before.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	However, if the patient is a young boy, then apply a fine cautery in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	**On the method of cauterization in melancholy.**
Caput XII.	**Chapter XII.**
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize them with cauteries, as we mentioned regarding paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of sad thoughts and the body is weakened by moisture, then give it something to purify its brain, as mentioned before in separation; then shave the head of the weak person, and make afterwards a proper poultice from flax, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head: and the patient, sitting square, should be held from all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply the linen compress.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is better from an ancient sheep's tallow.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it gently over a moderate fire, to the extent that the finger can tolerate when introduced into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Next, apply a cool compress in the middle of the head in a circular motion and continue until it becomes cold.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Apply this treatment to the patient once a week, along with the rest of his regimen, until he is cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	If it is yourself, cauterize it by making small punctures in most of it, apart from holding the hand with a cauterizing instrument; deep down, it smells bad.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	This type of cauterization moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Next, place on it a cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	**Regarding the method of cauterization with descending water.**
Caput XIII.	**Head XIII.**
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When you have determined the beginning of water in the eye by the signs I mentioned in division, then begin and wash the patient, with that which will cleanse his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep it free from all moisture, and make it sit in a bath, for several days of fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command her to shave her head and burn a scar in the middle of her forehead.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then burn them deeply with two irons if there is an accumulation of water in both eyes at the same time; or from one side, if there is an accumulation of water in one eye; and cut all the veins and arteries that are under the skin, and the burns should be long in width across the temples, and cauterize to stop the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything from this, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible, and I come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, cutting them off, and guarding against the flow of blood.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And when it is burned into the skin, under two bones, with the last two irons produced.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	**On cauterizing in ancient tears.**
Caput XIIII.	**Head XIV.**
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are ancient, continuous, and flow over the veins and arteries that are clearly visible on the outer part of the head, it is because of the excesses of cold phlegm; then burn with the same iron used at the beginning when water descends, burn in the middle of the forehead, and use two irons on each temple, and two irons on the skin under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you need to add to it, then cauterize it carefully on every side with a small cautery instrument above the end of the eyebrow.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	On the method of cauterizing a nose ulcer.
Caput XV.	Head XV.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it with what we mentioned in the previous section, and it does not respond to treatment; then apply a poultice of three nights, then shave the head and cauterize it with a medium cautery instrument and an olive cautery.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with two-sided cautery instrument above the two eyebrows slightly below the hairline.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And be careful not to injure the artery.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the form of the clauis cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	On the method of cauterizing palpebral softening.
Caput XVI.	Head XVI.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid softens due to inflammation or moisture; then cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery instrument, this cautery should be in the shape of a crescent moon.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	If you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows with just two cauterizing instruments on every part, and they will extend from two time periods; and the length of each cautery should be according to the length of the eyebrow, and do not use your whole hand with the cautery, but rather according to the amount that is burnt off of the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the form of the cautery according to this manner of lunar cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	§ Regarding the cauterization of the eyelid when the hairs turn sharp towards the eye.
Caput XVII.	Head XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery on it is according to two methods: either cautery with fire, or cautery with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	However, in cauterization with fire, especially the sick person should be prepared beforehand to remove their hairs, if there are any that need to be cut, until they lengthen and equalize.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, they are pricked near their origin: then close the patient's eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move until they heal.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they have healed and equalized, then place the head of the sick person in your lap: then make signs on the eyelids of the eye with wax, marking it according to the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a cloth soaked in albumen or in the mucus of psilia over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then use a hot iron whose shape is like this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape that you have marked gradually on many wounds until the surface of the skin is burned, which appears like the shape of a myrtle leaf entirely own.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of health of your work is: if you notice that the eyelid of the eye is contracting again and the hairs rising up near the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So raise your hand then, and leave it alone for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place a cloth with butter on it over it until the scar is gone.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any of the hairs return after an hour and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cauterization over that place as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	However, if the hairs are below: then cauterize it until it goes back to its natural place, and ensure that the hairs do not bother the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	On the method of cauterization when a burning medicine is used in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	**Chapter XVIII**
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is necessary to urge the patient to pull out the hairs until they are extended and equalized.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from a piece of cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take a known amount of soap and some dry lime, about an ounce or something like it, and rub them together vigorously while applying pressure to ensure they mix well, being careful not to let it freeze.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then take the prepared piece of cloth in the shape of a myrtle leaf and place it over one or both eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a cold compress soaked in egg white, holding the head of the patient in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine and gently press it.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you should move it whenever the patient feels a stinging sensation from the medicine, for its sting is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While he persists in this bite that he has discovered, then abandon the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the bite has ceased, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider that if you see the eyelid lifting up as it does when it contracts with heat or a cut, it is good; but if not, then repeat the application of medicine to the place where it has left no mark or stain until your operation is complete and the eye contracted.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place a poultice of butter on it until the burnt skin is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with a diaphoretic ointment or any other until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you, during the operation, to take care as the last step so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If after several days the eyelid becomes soft and something from the hair falls into the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which is becoming soft from the eyelid, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of humans differ in size and shape.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to that, your consideration should be such that the way of righteousness is not hidden from him who studies this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	§ On the method of cauterizing the lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment does not bring relief, then you should cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Tell the patient to place his head in your lap and hold his head with both hands in such a way that it does not move or be agitated while he performs this act.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place the heated cloth or a piece of mucilage over his eye: then apply the cauterizing iron, which has this shape.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	It should be shaped like the curve of a reed's quill from one end, as is done with the cauterizing iron; and if it goes through to the other end or tries to go up, then it is inadequate.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this cut is better suited for your purpose.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and drain the blood from it, and clean it; and if it is not open, then open it, and drain the pus from it.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place a hot iron on it, which is made to burn very much.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold it with your hand for a moment near the iron by the eye, to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient; and place the hot iron on the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you have reached the end of your hot iron up to the mouth, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not: then repeat the hot iron once or twice, as you need; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then apply a cloth with butter, and treat it with an antiseptic ointment until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If, after forty days, it does not heal: then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine to it until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some have called the first.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Intend to the location of the fistula and find it; then place a fine iron (i.e., a thin cannula) into that fissure.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it the quantity of a drachma of melted lead, and hold your hand firmly with good retention of the cannula, so that it does not move at all, or flow, or reach the eye with the melted lead.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place over the eye of the patient a cloth dipped in either albumen or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	Lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it with a wonderful cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	Which, when the fistula is healed through cauterization and treatment as we have said, is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if that does not happen, then it is necessary to create a nasal opening and bring the fistula back to flow with the nose, according to where it naturally goes.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	# On the Method of Cauterization in Lip Fissures.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Many times, cracks occur in the lip folds, which are called pilings, especially on the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you treat these cracks, as we said regarding the division of the disease, and if treatment does not help, then use a small iron cautery in this manner.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And the depth of it should be according to the thinness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then place the hot iron quickly into those cracks until it reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with a poultice until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	**On cauterizing oral fistulas.**
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of a gum, or on the palate, or among the roots of teeth; it forms pus and breaks out; then it becomes gangrened and pus runs, and a fistula is formed; if treatment does not help in this case, then hot cauterization should be applied according to its size.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then introduce the burning steel into the fistula's opening and hold your hand until the burning iron reaches its deepest point and its end: do this once or twice with two strokes.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then take care of it afterward, as we said about the treatment until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the healing separates and it heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to remove the place and take away the corrupt bone as it comes to its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	§ Regarding the method of cauterization in the gingiva and the softening of teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gingiva softens due to moisture and the teeth become loose, and treating it with medicines does not help, then put the sick head in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then apply the cauterizing fire, whose form comes after these steps, so that you place a tube over the tooth and quickly insert the burning cauterizing iron into it; hold your hand for a moment until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And then raise your hand; afterwards repeat the cautery several times, according to need.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then the patient should fill their mouth with salty water and hold it for one hour and then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the tooth's motion becomes fixed, the gums, having softened, tighten and thus the corrupted moisture dries up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	§ On the method of cauterization for tooth pain.
Caput XXIII.	Head XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When tooth pain is due to cold, or there is actual cold within the tooth itself, or decay, and treatment with medicines does not help, then cautery should be applied in one of two ways: either cautery with butter or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	The cautery with butter is to take the raw butter and boil it in a copper kettle or in vessels.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cloth, and apply it over the affected extremity.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse the affected part in the boiled butter and place it eagerly over the painful tooth, holding it until it becomes numb, and repeat this several times until the strength of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	If you wish, immerse the cloth or bandage in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; then place a hot iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	Its cauterization with fire is to aim for the air canal or the iron channel.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And it should be in the body so that the point of the fire does not reach the lower jaw.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply the cautery, whose shape will come together, and place it on that tooth; and hold your hand until the cautery becomes cold.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do that several times, for the pain will be moved, or on the same day, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary that the impression of that cautery fills the patient's mouth with good butter, and holds it for a certain time, then spits it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with any available point of the instrument according to what is possible, and this is the form of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	On the method of cauterization for styes.
Caput XXIIII.	**Chapter XXIV**
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When styes are affected with phlegm and cold humours, and do not yield to the operation of medicines, nor permit their dissolution by heat, then apply a hot cautery of this form.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	It should have two open ends so that smoke escapes from one end as the cautery is applied to the other; then place the glowing tip on the wound once, and a second time if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the wound.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the wound is shallow, then apply the cautery according to its depth.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Afterward, leave it for three days, and apply a poultice dipped in butter on top until the charred part is removed by the heat.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then care for it with a dental ointment until the shape of the canal is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	On the method of cauterization for hoarseness and difficulty in breathing.
Caput XXV.	**Chapter XXV**
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When moisture is collected over the lung channel, and especially when it is accompanied by the coldness of the skin, then it is necessary for the patient to be evacuated with the first use of laxative medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then, he should cauterize the same at the base of the throat in a depressed place, and be careful not to come across the cautery with it to the throat or skin, unless something of its own.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then, he should cauterize the same with another cautery at the joint of the neck in the last spine of it finishing: and let the cautery be made into a clasp according to the manner that preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then he should care for it with what preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	§ Regarding the method of cauterization in lung diseases and coughing.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When coughing and lung disease are caused by cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor phthisis, nor is the illness old: then he should cauterize the same with two cauteries above the furca in depressed places, gentle, smooth.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be made into a tube according to the form that preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if your cauterization by puncturing with a cauterizing instrument, called the *Punctum*, precedes the pain of the ear in puncturing; and there are punctures from thirty punctures as if to another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound itself with what preceded it, until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now it has three branches according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Why should cauterization be done with it when you make three cuts with it at once?
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	§ On the method of cauterization in the *Titillico*, in the dislocation of the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the helper is dislocated due to moisture and does not form itself back to its original position within the allotted time, until it has become accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a slight movement, which happens as we have already testified, at that time you must reduce the dislocation in the first instance.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient should be placed back on his back or side, over the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin, which is inside the *Titillico* towards the upper parts with your left hand's fingers; and if the joint dislocates to the interior side.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then, having a fire-brand, he holds two vessels.
Cuius forma est haec.	What is the form of this?
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then he cauterizes the skin, until it penetrates to another side, and the figure of the cauterization joins with four fire-brands.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes the cauterization is made with a fire-brand that has three vessels, why then the figure of the cauterization becomes six fire-brands; and the vessels are according to the thinness of what is attempted.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of the fire-brand that has three vessels.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added beyond this manner, why then there are eight fire-brands.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then he places crushed salt on the fire-brand.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then he makes the injured part adhere to tranquility, so that the member does not move until it is healed.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is to higher parts and it happens rarely, then he cauterizes itself on the shoulder with a fire-brand of a key, or with many points of fire-brands.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	When the union is strengthened and moisture is removed, the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	**On the method of cauterization of the stomach.**
Caput XXVIII.	**Chapter XXVIII.**
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and great moisture happens in the stomach, until they extract it from its condition, and phlegm is multiplied towards it, and persistent treatment is required, and no relief is afforded, then the patient should lie down on his back, and extend his legs, and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the shape of a scallop in quantity equal to one finger, and two cauteries below the two sides of the single cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And stretch between each other so that they do not join when pus is formed.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cautery should be the amount of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And the figure of the cauteries should be according to this form without addition, and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery that is made for this cautery be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it which is troubled by this cautery; and it is as if signs are made on the stomach with punctures according to the quantity, as when wax is incised with encaustic; then it is cauterized itself with the cautery of the puncture; then it is cared for with the cure that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	On the manner of cauterizing with cold.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain occurs in the liver due to cold and moisture, or because of a thick excess of humor, until it is freed from its natural excessive discharge, and the patient is cured as we have said, and it does not benefit him; then he should lie back on his own head, and make signs with encaustic in three cauterizations according to this figure, and the same quantity below the epigastrium from the hypocondria where the elbow of the man reaches: and let there be a space between every cautery according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand much with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of that which is to be cauterized be according to the thickness of the skin, half of its quantity not added; and let the patient stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If, however, he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of cauterization.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize these wounds with the cautery knife when subtlety and caution reside within your art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And take care not to proceed too far with cauterization, so that the thickness of the skin throughout is not too severe, which could affect the whole body and reach the intestines: since the skin there is thin, therefore be aware of this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	§ Concerning the method of cauterization, proceed with caution regarding the liver.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens, and you need to know if that cautery mark is on the liver or its membrane, then if it's on the liver, a severe pain arises without any acuity, and gravity takes over; but if it's on the membrane of the liver, intense pain accompanies it, and you now see that their treatment has exhausted them.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, the patient must take back his weight on his head.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then, the shape of the cautery mark with wax is made; then, ignite the cautery tool that resembles a flame.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is his form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And it should be burned with one cauterization until the whole skin is consumed by fire, and it reaches the siphon, until all the pus flows out; then care should be taken for the cure of the ulcers, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And this method of cauterization should not be used unless one is skilled in the art of medicine and has dealt with these illnesses many times before; then, and only then, should he dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	To release it, I prefer to do it myself.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	## On Cauterization for Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that cauterization with the roots of aristolochi should be used for cold pleurisy according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is, as you receive the roots of dried aristolochi, one root longer, which is found from that, and it should be like the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then dip it into oil, and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Next, he cauterizes with one cautery the space between the fork's continuation and the neck, and with two small cauteries beneath the guides at a slight decline towards the part beneath the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in the space between the fifth and sixth ribs towards the rear a little, and another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from the rear: one in the space between the two blades, and two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to press your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be placed openly on the skin so that it smells.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And certain ancient people have said that there are men who use cauteries made of similar iron radii: they ignite them and insert them into the space between the ribs until they reach the same point as the cautery, and then blood flows out, as we said about the hepatic apostema.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this cauterization, there is a risk that either the patient dies immediately or an ulcer occurs at the site, which does not heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	**On Cauterization: The Splen (Spleen) Head 32.**
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat an illness of the spleen, because of what we said about dividing the illness from the treatment, and your treatment does not benefit, then there is cauterization in it according to three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of these is to make three or four incisions along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the smaller livers (the ones that precede in order), whose shape should be followed.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And for every incision, the thickness should be that of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And the manner of incision, which we said in the liver incision, should be equal.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand down with the incision; let the patient lie on their back, weak and relaxed.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another mode of cauterization is: to have the fire for the incision with two veins, as we said in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus; and lift the skin that is directly on the spleen where the lower left cubit arrives, and your lifting should be according to the width of the body so that the incisions fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two hot instruments deeply until they penetrate the skin on the other side; then extract the cautery; so the four incisions are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you use cautery with another instrument holding three veins.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then, after you have released the pus for many days, care for the cautery; for it is more beneficial than any of the treatments that preceded it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	§ On the method of cauterization in hydrops.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery should not be applied to hydrops unless the swelling is properly drained.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a hydrops using the methods we have described in division, and the treatment does not improve, then you should apply four cauterizations around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another on the epigastrium, one on the spleen, two behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach; and let the depth of the cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery open so that it can release pus over time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not withdraw the weak from treatment after cauterization with it, for it should have two intentions; and it will quickly be healed with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery instrument with which the stomach is cauterized should be curved; it should follow the shape that preceded it. And the shape of the one with which the back is cauterized should be oily; it should follow the shape that preceded it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	**On the method of cauterizing feet and crural areas.**
Caput XXXIIII.	**Chapter XXXXIV.**
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they are soaked in hydropic (a medicinal solution) and replenished with citrine water, one should cauterize over the back of the foot at the instep, which is between the ankle bone and the little toe. Then raise your hand holding the cautery, without twisting it, and afterward raise your hand again, without touching it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	The citrine water will then revive, and the cautery should be applied in this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on both crural areas, one at the top of each leg, and let the edge of the cautery be a knife-like point; make another cautery along the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other lower down, roughly in the middle of the thigh; and make two cauteries over the entire hip. Leave the open cautery without treatment for a long time, so that some water can heal from it; then care for the rest as we have mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	**On the method of cauterizing in the abdominal solution.**
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXX5.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the resolution of the entrails from cold and humors is delayed until the vital forces of digestion, which are in the stomach and intestines, are weakened; and it is treated with methods of treatment, but does not heal, you will see the patient enduring the heat of a strong vitality, then cauterize itself with a great cautery on its own stomach, as was done previously in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a fine cautery; and a cautery over the liver above the ribs, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture and the patient enduring it, then cauterize yourself with a cautery over the breast, and another over the entire body; and perhaps add two small cauteries over the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	Indeed, healing is successful whose aid does not waver.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	**On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.**
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids, or one large one, arising from thick, cold, or corrupt humors, and they are treated as we have said in division, but do not benefit from the treatment; then cauterize with three cauteries over the lower spine below the navel slightly triangular, and a cautery under the navel like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face turn pale, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery as has been previously described; and with another cautery over his epigastrium, and another over his spleen with a claw cautery; and leave the open cautery for some time. Then take care of him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Regarding the method of cauterizing after their removal.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you remove the athelul (a term referring to a specific anatomical structure), then ignite the cautery that is similar to a radium.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the ignited cautery into the athelul that has been removed; and with your final touch, continue until the cautery reaches the venous opening from which the blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore there are many athelul (structures), then cauterize each one with a cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with ointments until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over the ulcer, it is more ultimate (or, final) in the healing process.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	On the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the instructions for section and treatment that we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he will heal with a cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When a fistula therefore occurs in someone and becomes chronic, pus runs from it, and corrupt humors (fluids) gather.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore, with due care, one should explore it with a delicate probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then, determine the depth of it with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply the cautery, which is similar to a hot iron.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the burning instrument itself into the fistula, and determine how far the clot (or blockage) has entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And apply the cautery repeatedly over it until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from the burn of nerve, if it is there, or a large vein; or if the fistula extends to the urinary body, or to the intestinal body, then guard yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not perform it unless there is a fistula in a fleshy part, for you think that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then pay attention to the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If, however, the place is sealed and the materials are removed from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then you know that it has already healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the materials do not separate from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a deep hole corrupted within it, or as if it were among those, whose memory will come to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	§ On the method of cauterizing veins.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When there is pain in the kidneys due to cold or excessive heat, and they are weakened because of it, then one should cauterize them immediately over a hot stone placed on top of the kidneys, with a cautery iron over every kidney, whose memory precedes it.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it again a second time in the same hot stone.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	That is why three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be the last resort in treatment.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	Regarding the cauterization of vesicles.
Caput XL.	Head (40th chapter).
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening due to cold and moistures occur in the vesicle, until the patient is unable to retain urine, then cauterize it at the lower part of the suprarrenal gland above the vesicle, where the hairs begin to grow, and use a cauterizer from above and another from below; and the length of this cauterization should be according to the size of the thumb: and cauterize it also with a cauterizer on the lower back, or with two cauterizers if needed; and let it follow the same procedure as before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	Regarding the method of cauterization of the matrix.
Caput XLI.	Head (41st chapter).
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moistures affect the matrix, preventing conception and causing irregular menstruation, with pain upon their onset, then it should be cauterized with three cauterizers around the navel, as we mentioned in the cauterization of the vesicle, and with a cauterizer above the lower back or with two cauterizers; and let it follow the same procedure as before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterization for a dislocated joint.
Caput XLII.	**Chapter XLII**
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the humidities of the mucous membranes are discharged into the anchor (joint), they become the cause of its exit from its place; and this is indicated by the extension of one leg over the other when they are compared again: and the site of dislocation is found to be hollow in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the infirm joint above the anchor with a similar circular cautery; after you have marked with wax around the joints, as it were, and so that the joint itself falls into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And this cautery, whose shape precedes the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large oily cautery; and make the depth of the cautery according to the thickness of the skin throughout.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	**On the method of cauterization for sciatica.**
Caput XLIII.	**Chapter XLIII**
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the ankle joint due to cold and moisture, and this treatment does not improve but instead aggravates the condition, then it is necessary to relieve the patient from thick humours with foul or artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then apply a cauterization.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	The method of cauterization is in this case according to two methods: either a cautery with medicated ointments or a cautery with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	A cautery with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of these methods involves cauterizing the ankle joint itself with three triangular cautery instruments, in this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a deep incision, good or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And leave a space between each cautery that is the width of a finger; and the cautery should be oiled.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	However, a cautery is also made in the middle on top of the ankle joint itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cauterizations?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you cauterize with a circle, whose shape precedes in the cauterization of the dislocation of the ankle, it should be so that the circle contains the ankle completely.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickening of the skin throughout.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in sciatica when the pain is adhering to the ankle itself and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	However, if it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize the inside of the hip with two cauterizations, on the spot where the patient feels pain, and use your cautery on the four fingers towards the outer part a little bit: and let the cauterization be surgical.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cauterization should be according to the depth of the thickening of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the patient feels that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize the place indicated by the patient with a point, three, four, or more cauteries if needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize the place with a single cautery of the knife.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And be careful in all your cauterizations so as not to burn the last nerves or a large artery, and take care through it to avoid further harm or contraction of the afflicted part.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have indeed seen one and another of those who cauterized on the wound, and ended up with cauterization, and the foot was inflated, until the swelling reached the toe, and it was entirely perforated and corrupted; then there was a rupture of the abdomen, and death followed afterwards.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If there is pain in both parts at the same time, cauterize both according to this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise ones spoke about cauterizing the aching part, whose cauterization is this method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar one from iron, whose diameter is the middle of the palm: and it should be near the opening according to the thickness of the finger's nucleus, or a little less; and within that same third should be placed.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space between each pin be the length of a thumb; and let the pins be open from both parts; and their height should be like a node, or two nodes; and make handles for them out of well-suited iron within the pins.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it is heated over fire until it glows, and scatters sparks; then place it on the scales above the infected foot lying on its healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, cauterize him with three round cauterizations using one application of heat.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave it for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	After that, apply poultices with butter, and leave the open wound for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says that with this kind of cauterization, we have little experience because of the fear it inspires and because few people know how to perform it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless, for those who endure it, there is good healing, and they will find its place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	When cauterization is performed alongside medicines, as you do with two identical tools having a perforated ring, into which descends the hinge of its door made of iron or bronze, whose length reaches the wall—with two knots, or something like them, at their top—...
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there should be a space between both, equal to the thickness of a finger, open below and above, and such that they fit together in this way.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on the patient's healthy side, lying on their sick side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly over the wound.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then apply a poultice between two circles of hot water, heated with fire to the point of warmth, and hold it for an appropriate amount of time; thus the patient will tolerate both the biting (of the wound) and its burning, as he himself caused the bite like fire until it subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe away the hot water from the wound with sweet water entirely; then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter over it until the burn's blackness is removed; and leave it for several days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is indeed the last resort in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the thigh or the foot, make a soak for him according to what you did for the wound, equally containing water.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the way of hot water, and I have already written about it in the book on medical rectification.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take some alkali and unextinguished lime, of each one part; rub both, and put them in a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with a small hole according to the quantity that will enter it; and place beneath the bottom of the pot another pot that has been previously hollowed out: then throw over the alkali and lime water from a sweet spring, so that both are submerged by one finger; after which compress them well with your hand, and leave the pot until sharp water descends to the lower part of the hollowed-out pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then add all that water to it and throw it over another lime; and continue until it renews itself.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For at that time it will be very sharp and effective, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of the other parts of the body.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And there are medicines with which wide burns are cauterized, such as pitch, turpentine, and almond oil, and lime with soap, so that each is mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed reported, narrating the cure of a certain man from ancient times who was cured of the pain of the ankle and sciatic nerve, and he praised it as being very magnificent.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it did not need any other treatment, and that he was healed at once, until he returned, because perhaps he had entered the bath with a disease, and left it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is taken from a green vegetable; if it cannot be found fresh, it is taken dry and recent; and it is heated much with some fat, and placed on the spot where there is pain, in the leg or hip, and bound, and left for three hours' duration, or according to the amount that the patient feels relief from the heat.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then insert it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When the body becomes cold, insert it into the fire.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	Since the pain retreats, it is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know this, for it is not necessary that anyone use a cauterizing iron with these medicines unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, who said that goat dung, when applied with it to a sciatic vein, relieves him; and the cauterization is made in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take the wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep spot that is between the big toe of the foot and the ankle, and closer to the ankle.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, and ignite it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it upon the wound and release it until it heals.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore continue this until sensation returns to the midpoint, and the pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of burning is called the vaccinating burn.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	§ On the burning of the back's pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, or from chance, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, and similar conditions due to the injection of cold and moist material; and the cauterizing does not take place unless it is in this particular case alone which is caused by the injection of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore after evacuation of the infirmity with foul pills and similar ones, three lines should be drawn on the back where there is pain according to its width, then signs with encaustic are made in every line five times or more punctures, according to the quantity which came from the tolerance of the nurse, and the cauterization is done when the cauterizing point has been reached.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauterizations, using a cautery on the mid-clasp, in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	**On the manner of cauterization in incipient gangrene.**
Caput XLV.	**Head XLVI.**
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in very young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its onset in children is: that a constriction occurs above the belly during breathing, and movement; and you will find it in the lower spine and the knots of his back, which have already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you see this, and wish to do it, then cauterize the same with a circular cautery in this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And the cautery should take hold over all parts of the vertebrae equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebrae with a point cautery, make two or three lines, and the points should be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place until it heals as we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, do not apply cauterization to the gangrene that occurs from nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing podagra and pained joints.
Caput XLVI.	**Chapter XLVI**
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of the joined parts are caused by cold humidities that extend to any part of the body, and when pains occur in the feet, it is customarily called podagra by physicians.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When podagra is cured by means of treatment due to cold causes and the pains do not subside, then cautery should be used to remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is done that after evacuating the joint of the foot, cautery should be applied with many cauteries and this cautery is with oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	The form of this is.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to make points on the surface of the foot, then make them with a cautery point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If the pains rise up to the knees or other joints, and this happens often, then cauterize the whole knee with three cauteries or four from every side, using the same cautery as for the claw.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	However, if more of this cautery is necessary for you, then cauterize the whole thing.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with a cautery, but rather place it around the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	However, if the pains rise to the knees and back, then administer what we said regarding cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pains are only in the hands, then make dots around with a flame, as two lines are resolved.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	However, if there remains pain in the fingers, then make dots on them, over every knot and also on the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	However, if the pains rise after days to the forearms or shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not delay the weak from good treatment, from receiving medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good treatment is done, and the phlegm is expelled, it will be healed with God's help through this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	**On the method of cauterization in ruptures.**
Caput XLVII.	Head XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine descends towards the testicle, becoming inflamed, it is then necessary to urge the patient to abstain from food on that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And it should be used to release the stool from its lower part.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then he should sit between your hands on his back and urge him to hold his breath until he expulses the stool or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce the swelling with your fingers and mark with a hot wax sigil above the rupture on the ribcage, where the end of the sigil is similar to the midpoint of a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply a hot iron whose shape is as described until it turns white and releases the pus.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine or the hernia to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then the assistant should place his hand over the area to prevent the intestine from escaping and you, having already opened between the patient's legs, placed a poultice beneath and another above his groin, and another one over his chest which holds the hands in place.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the hot iron over the sigil, with your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it yourself, until you gain access to the mouth with it; or use it again once with another if you have not gained access to the mouth with it at first up to the end of the jaw.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And be careful to observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, so as not to burn it itself, and let it heal through that onto the afflicted part or cause great pain or death.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not gain access to the mouth with your cautery, your operation is in vain.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary that the cautery for children be subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care with the remaining ointments until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And the afflicted person should lie on their back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you provide its nourishment for the duration of its healing, which softens its bowels; so that the intestine does not come out near the anus and expulsion.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when you want to rise after forty days, then administer a well-made ligature and hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And it becomes lessened by labour, and filling with food and drink, and restless conversations.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when this regimen is used, thus is achieved complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the healing of ruptures with incisions in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When ruptures occur in the rest of the stomach, and they are beginning and appear not to be spreading, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size; and it should be treated from then on as if it were one-third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then attend to it yourself, as we said, and let it not be added.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is sealed with wax, a line is drawn which crosses the width at the upper side of the rupture, and another line at the lower side.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cautery cleaver.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	On the method of cauterization for pains due to injury or impact.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When, in certain parts, pain occurs due to injury or impact, and this pain persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then it should be cauterized with a point-burn.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And the cautery of every part should be according to its size, and its thinness or thickness, and its strength, and the position of the torsion, and the pain it causes.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If, therefore, it is healed from the first cauterization, that is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat the cauterization on that same place.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Since these pains have the habit of shifting from one part to that which is nearest, in order to alleviate them, they must be transferred.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore, it is necessary to follow up on them with cauterization until the patient is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	On the method of cauterization for leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX. Head.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	However, in lepromatous patients, cauterization should be applied with great care.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy, which occurs due to putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy; so when considering to cauterize it, be wary.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If leprosy is beginning to appear and you have treated it as we said before, but it does not disappear or recede, and you are afraid that the corruption has spread over the entire complexion of the body; then cauterize it on the head with five cauterizations: one in the middle of the forehead, and a second below it facing the front at the end of the hair, and two on either side over the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally, apply your hand with the cautery briefly, until it makes a slight impression on the bone, and the scales come loose from it; so that the expulsion of gross vapors is facilitated from it, and cauterize over it again with another cautery, as was previously done.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	However, if leprosy is now scattered over the body and appears clearly manifest; then you should cauterize with these cauterizations we mentioned for the head, and another cautery over the ends of the nose, and two cauterizations over each cheekbone, and two over the spine of the neck, and six over the spine of the back, and one large over the hip bones, and one above it; also over both shoulders, two over each knee, two over the softness of his chest; and cauterize him all over the joints, from the joints of his fingers and toes; and cauterize over every heel of his feet, and the palms of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And be aware of the nerves that are above the back of the heel, so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes a burn is made with a hot iron on the bone of the ribs, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the bone of the skull.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add to the burning, the greater is the healing, and the more it brings relief.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick do not feel pain from the burn as the healthy do; for their body is already stunned.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And the burns should be of appropriate size and depth according to the members and joints; according to what has been mentioned regarding the types of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the burns with flour and herb paste with honey, and other treatments, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	**On the Method of Burning in Stunning**
Caput L.	**Head (L)**
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a member is stunned and treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, but it does not heal, then burn that stunned member according to its size or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cauterization be done in such a way that it does not penetrate too deeply into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And when it is cauterized to a state of numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, at the joints of the spine near the exit of the nerves that move that limb, then the numbness subsides.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	Indeed, one should not attempt this unless they are wise in the anatomy of the body and the exit of nerves that move the limbs.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	§ On the method of cauterization as described by Albucasis.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albucasis is outdated and does not offer anything new in the art of medicine, then cauterize over that cautery deeply, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and arni leaves, and pigeon's blood, and vulture's blood: each should be in equal parts: mix all these together, and apply them to a cloth, and let them adhere to the place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterizing a cancer.
Caput LII.	**Chapter LII**
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When the cancer is just beginning and it itself can be stopped; then cauterize it with a hot iron in the shape of a circle around its circumference, as required.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	However, it has been said that it should be cauterized with the last iron in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But I do not find that to be the case; for I fear it may ulcerate, and I have seen it happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it should be cauterized around its circumference with a circle, as we said, or with many hot irons.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterizing an abscess.
Caput LIII.	**Chapter LIII**
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has an abscess that is delayed in ripening, due to its own excess or because of the weakness of old age, when it becomes thin and there is little blood, or due to time, and you wish to hasten the ripening of the abscess, then cauterize around its circumference with many small hot irons.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then, release her.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	It will also be hastened by the ripening of the fruit.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	However, if you wish to make an incision in it with a cautery, then apply the fire of the cautery, which has this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place this itself in the middle of the wound, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery follow from this, as the disease requires, so that the pure current is restored.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	§ In the manner of cauterization, in a mild corrosive.
Caput LIIII.	Head (L II I)
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corrosive is nothing but corruption in a moving member, and it corrupts itself; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corrosive in a place that can bear the fire of a cautery, then apply many cauteries with small and large cleavages, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosive is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until the entire corruption is eliminated and nothing remains of it thoroughly.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and place over the burnt areas finely crushed sulfur with oil, until all the scabs and every corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Next, treat it with ointments that nourish the flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days the flesh is born with a healthy newness in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization over what remains from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corrosive [disease] should be treated sometimes with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	Indeed, it [the healing process] arises at the place of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cauterization with fire is more beneficial for the healing process: and indeed I have already said that cauterization should be done with acute medicine in certain cases; therefore, take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	§ Regarding the cauterization of claws and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This affliction often occurs in the lower parts of the feet; it is a thick, putrid matter that damages the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed, there is cauterization in them according to two methods: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for when using fire, it is similar to cauterizing with a heated pen, made of iron according to the quantity it contains of the claw from every side and is thin at the margins.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the same fire above the claw.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then, with the hand covered in cautery, revolve it around the claw until the cauterization reaches the depth of the claw, and leave it for three days until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply it with a paste made from crushed garlic mixed with salt, and leave the paste on top overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	It will indeed be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a healing ointment made from meat until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not improved and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then apply cauterization to them with hot water. It is as if you take a small tube made of iron or steel or a feather from a bird, and place it over the claw or any other part.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Next, insert a small amount of warm water into a tube. Hold your hand and twist it slightly with the pressure of your hand, so that the edge of the tube is pressed against the root of the nail, and the warm water reaches the depths, to the root of the nail, and the patient should wait for about an hour after the application of the hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then release it, for the nail is eradicated along with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with each one, one after the other, until you have treated all that are present in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they have been eradicated, using what generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	§ On the method of cauterization in tremor.
Caput LVI.	Head (LVI)
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When someone experiences tremor due to cold in a nerve, or from quartan fever, or any other cause, then they should be cauterized four or five times over the spinal bones, and between each spinal bone with a cautery, and also over the chest, and over the stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor ceases with the application of oil cauterization, and hastens the healing of cold disease.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	On the manner of cauterization according to Albucasis.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes Albucasis expels impurities from the body, that is, pustules that are formed from corrupted coarse materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when you see them appearing, they should be cauterized with a fine iron on every part of the pustule's head, whose tip is heated with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long Aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a semicircular iron.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized, they draw out the impurity as it was first expelled in this manner, and they do not increase, but break up the surplus, making them well, and healing from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it should be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the manner of cauterization in bleeding from an artery in the arm.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many times there occurs a flow of blood from an artery that has been cut near a wound that happens externally or at the site of a scarification or cauterization of a limb, and similar things: and it becomes difficult to sever it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, if this happens to someone, then apply with your hand directly to the opening of the artery, and place over it your index finger, and squeeze it tightly until the blood is obstructed under your finger and does not escape from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then apply a small oil lamp and many more to the cauterization, and blow on them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one, or a few, or a large one, according to the wound and the place where the artery is severed, and place the cauterization on the same vessel, after which you move your finger quickly; and hold the cauterization until the blood stops.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled with the withdrawal of the finger from the opening of the artery and the extinguishing of the cauterization, then quickly take another cauterization from those prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not stop doing this with one after another until the blood stops.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful not to burn the nerves that are there, and let no further harm come to the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And you should know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to sever it; especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or when using cauterization, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or when using extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends are torn, and blood is severed.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or they place over it medicinal substances that aid in stopping the flow of blood, and tighten them with a suitable constricting bandage.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever administers the severing with ligature and tightening with cloth, or positioning of burning substances and similar methods, does not do it thoroughly unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If such a thing happens to someone and they have no doctor or medicine, then they should begin by positioning their index finger over the wound's artery opening as we described, and tightening it strongly until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the injury, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And let not the finger be moved, but keep it always above the cold water, until the blood becomes congealed and swollen and can be cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, consider what it needs from cauterization or medicine.
¶ Partis Primae Finis.	§ End of the First Part.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	The Chirurgic Book of Albucasis, Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	§ On incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds and similar conditions.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	As we said in Chapter One, every illness that involves fire from cauterization and burning medicine, along with its circumstances, causes, instruments, and forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed chapters there from the beginning to the end.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that it may be clear for anyone who seeks to know about it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, O son, to learn from the fear that is in the first chapter about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of this, it is necessary to be more careful, for in the operation described in this chapter, the wound often bleeds heavily with blood, which can lead to death at the time of opening a vein, or cutting into an abscess, or opening a fistula, or treating a wound, or extracting an arrowhead, or cutting into stone, and similar things; from all these comes trembling and fear, and in many cases, death.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I advise you not to be caught off guard, for sometimes people with certain conditions come to you in this art of medicine, and they are different from others.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For some become angry when confronted with their illness, and for them, death is light because of the severity they find from their condition and the duration of their suffering.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when illness arises from fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them are those who hand over their fate to a physician, trusting him for healing, and their illness becomes their undoing.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, you should not give in to those who come to you from among these, whose ways are such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And be more careful, than your greed and rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume over anything from that, unless after certain knowledge that confirms among you the admirable succession to which it has come.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And you should apply yourself to the care of all your sick, with prognosis and indication for what is appropriate for their healing.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	In that very thing lies your aid for the sake of gaining fame, glory, memory, and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	God's Son, inspire you with his understanding, and do not deprive you of guidance and inspiration, for it is in his hands.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have indeed organized this chapter by distinguishing it into sections, following what preceded in the chapter on cauterization from head to foot: so that you may find from it whatever you seek and whatever you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	**On the treatment of water accumulated in the heads of children.**
Caput I.	**Chapter I.**
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this ailment often occurs in children at the time of birth, or when the midwife tightly squeezes the child's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever something happens, even due to an unseen cause that is unknown.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed, I have not seen this disease in others as much as in children, and to every one of them death has followed: therefore it seemed to me necessary to give up the operation on it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed, I have seen from them a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was magnified every day until he could not sit on himself because of the size of his head; and the humidity increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this humidity, either it accumulates between the skin and the bone, or it accumulates beneath the bone on the surface.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on it, if there is humidity between the skin and the bone and an abscess is present, then you should make one crack in the middle of the head in width; and the length of the crack should be like two knots, until the humidity runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the abscess.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the humidity has increased more and the abscess is larger, then put these two cracks according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the humidity is beneath the bone and its sign is that you see the openings of the commissures of the head from every side; and water sinks down when you press it with your hand towards the interior, and it does not hide itself from you, then you should make three cracks in the middle of the head according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the cut, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tighten the wounds with cloth and lint.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then sew it up from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligature, care for the wound with bandages and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not release the tension from the head equally.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the weak with dry food containing little moisture, until the member is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And there is another method of cutting as you consider where the magnitude of the abscess appears and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is in the back of the head, or on the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So rise up with the cut where you see the abscess and the collection of water, and split it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And beware not to cut the artery, and let there be no flow of blood, and the weak may die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	On the incision of arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	**Chapter II.**
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When someone suffers from a catarrh affecting the eyes or chest, and it becomes chronic and does not respond to medical treatment, then the final remedy lies in the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when one decides to incise them, they should ensure that the diseased head is removed.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then, using a rough cloth, one should create a space so that the arteries become visible.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then, the diseased neck should be tightened with any cloth available.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then, consider where the pulse of the vein is located.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of both [arteries] are the areas behind the depressed ears; they rarely become hidden, except in certain people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then, mark them with wax on both sides; and incise each one with a sharp scalpel on both sides accurately down to the bone; and it should be done according to the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, introduce a spatula beneath the artery and cut it towards the upper parts with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And the length of the incision should be like two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood flows out with pulsating force, rising into the interiors with frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	However, if the artery is not visible to the eye, then it is necessary that the distance from gold should be the quantity of space equal to three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with wax and follow until it reaches the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what needs to be released from blood is six ounces and perhaps you release more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of this according to the amount that appears to you from the condition of the patient and the fullness of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains anything near the bone from healing, cut it so that there is no risk of a hot abscess; then tighten the wound with linen bands.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	On the extraction of arteries, which are found in certain parts of the body.
Caput III.	Head III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When an old headache or sudden acute catarrh occurs due to the harsh humidities and heat in the face, or because of a sharp object such as a splinter, and similar causes, and treatment with the usual medical methods does not help, then we have to resort to the extraction of arteries from these parts, or their cauterization, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation for extracting them is to remove the weak hair from the part, and pull towards the visible artery in that time.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	It is indeed shown to you from its pulse, and it is rarely hidden unless in a few people or due to coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then press the weak head with any cloth you have; afterward, use fear to apply a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or use steam with hot water until it appears manifestly to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a knife that I formed a little while ago.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then use it to scrape the skin easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it and pull it towards the upper parts until you extract it from the skin, and make it pass through the tunics that are under it from all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If, however, the artery is thin: then pierce it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then make an incision from that part according to the length of its ends, and tighten it, so that there is no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not incised and not severed, the blood will not flow completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then take six ounces of blood from the vein until three ounces remain.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread, either from silk or from some other string, so that it does not flow into putrefaction before the wound heals and the blood flow occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then make an incision on the surplus, which is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Perform that operation at that time, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you see it, cauterize it with a hot iron from the mouth to the end, with a cautery knife; until its ends are cut off and it becomes firm in that place through the same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better work, unless the patient has fever or is of heated complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because the cautery is from those things that dry up humors.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better drainage.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the arteries are extracted, the place must be filled with cooked fat; and small pieces of well-made cloth should be placed on top of it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the wound is dressed with dried medicines that promote the growth of flesh, and with bandages, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, while you are operating, a flow of blood from the artery occurs, then quickly proceed to cut it off with a cautery, or fill the place with a plug; and hold your hand tightly until the blood stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those things is present to you, then place your finger on the place until the blood clots.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And it embrows the site with a steady application of cold water until the acute pain subsides and it tightens as necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is easier to extract arteries from a softer and more pliable part, it is done by cauterizing the vein with these two instruments, and the sharpness of both knives should be similar.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they have much less sharpness than the two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are as sharp as the two knives, both will apply coldness, and they will not cut into the flesh swiftly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore, since they have a little less thickness, heat from fire is retained in them and flesh is cut swiftly; so with this, the work needs to be done better, easier, and lighter of all works.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And there should be a space between the two knives equal to the thickness of a finger, after you mark with encaustics two places; and apply fire vigorously to both until they reach the wound, and cut the vein at both places: so as to elongate what is between its extremities.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not solidify completely with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	On the treatment of continuous acute tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	**Head IV.**
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When tears are continuous and flow from the eyes, which are situated on top of the skull, and no medical treatment brings relief, while you see the face of the patient turning red and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead like that of ants walking, and his eyes become strained, wet, to the point that their hairs are damaged by the constant flow, and the eyelids are inflamed from the intensity of the tears, then the ancients employed a special method for treating them, calling it 'the operation with the knife'.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is as if you instruct the patient to shave the hairs on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions evenly spaced along the length of the forehead, and the length of each incision should be about two fingers, with one incision placed in the middle of the forehead at the level of the nose, the second a little below the movement of the eyebrows, and the third on the other side. Be careful to avoid the arteries located on both sides. Extend your hand from the continuation of the lower jaw, and the distance between the incisions should be about three fingers. Prepare a piece of sponge or a dry cloth, with which you will absorb the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the blade of a sharp instrument at both ends, after which comes the shape.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is from the temporal part, to the second incision: and the scar, together with it, all the skin which is between the two incisions, with the heal, which is over the mouth.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do that from the median incision to the second incision as well.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this scalpel and insert another instrument into the first incision again, which is called a sharp knife, with one side blunt, not sharp on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side against the flesh attached to the skin, and its blunt side towards the mouth; and push it until it reaches the median fissure, and cut along with it all the tendons that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues until what appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the median fissure until another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when it flows from blood in an equal amount, express the places from which the coagulated blood has formed a clot.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put in every fissure lint made from old cloth, and place over them rags soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And observe that there is no risk of a hot abscess.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, loosen the ligature and administer a large amount of the infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then apply that care with the ointment of basilicon to the rest of the wounds, until they are healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	§ On the care of acute tears and cataracts on the eyes from internal head injuries.
Caput V.	Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When a person suffers from acute, intense, and persistent cataracts, you will notice their eyes are exhausted, weak, and their appearance is already debilitated; the eyelids are ulcerated, hair falls out of them, and there is a deep pain in the head, painful and causing subsequent sneezing. Then, from these circumstances, one must understand that these materials do not come out of the eyes unless through many channels.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you should advise the sick person to scrape their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make one cut in that fissure in the middle of the forehead, or slightly beyond its width, and begin with the cut from the left side towards the right temple; continue the incision until it reaches the bone; then extend your hand away from the temporals, which move during chewing, until you reach the jawbone; remove all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate it between the two lips of the fissure with a hot iron or with linen lint.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tighten it from above with small threads and moisten the threads with wine and oil so that there is no risk of a hot abscess.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you dissolve it and see that the hot abscess is already approaching, then you must grind your teeth until the flesh begins to grow there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of flesh, as if you were to take two parts of flour from wheat and four parts of colophony, prepare a paste from them and apply it to these wounds to promote the birth of flesh.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	§ On the care of that which falls into the gold.
Caput VI.	Head VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the gold belongs to one of four categories: either a mineral stone or something similar to stone, like iron and glass; or from a plant, such as wheat and beans; or a fluid substance, like water, vinegar, and others similar; or some kind of animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When something that resembles a stone or belongs to the stone family falls into the gold and does not add to or grow in it, expose the gold to the sun alone. If you then see the stone, distill some of the molten oil or essence into the gold.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then he should perform the extraction of the foreign body, and make the patient sneeze when ready, and press on the nostrils at the onset of sneezing, after you place a piece of cloth or wool around the ear area and stretch the ear towards the upper parts.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Indeed, this treatment should be repeated many times.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	However, if it does not come out, then perform the extraction with the use of poultices, that is, subtle compresses made from pizigari (a traditional medicinal herb), whose form is as follows...
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out with the poultice, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then perform the extraction with a delicate, slightly curved hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it still does not come out through that (method), then make a tube from metal and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal deeply, and press the material around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so as to block any passage except for the tube; then extract it with your strong pulling force.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Indeed, it often comes out with what we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If however it does not come out in that way, then take some helkalimb (a type of herbal preparation) or from a viscose (prepared glue), with which birds' feathers are caught, a small amount, and place it on the tip of a radius after you have carefully wrapped a clean cloth around it; then insert it into the ear canal easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have mentioned, then proceed to divide it, before a hot apoplexy or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the manner of the incision is, as the phlebotomist makes an incision in the weakest part of the head; and he draws out blood from it according to the measure of its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then place the weak part between your hands, and turn its ear towards the upper parts, and find a small incision at the root of the ear, near the fat, in the depressed place; and make the incision in the shape of a crescent until you reach the stone; then remove it with what is possible for you among the instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then use that incision with speed from your hourglass, and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the matter falling into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, it does not obey you for its exit, then take a thin, delicate forceps in this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the cutting off of that kind from the grains that fall into the ear, and do not do that when you think that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you place many turns on it; then remove them with hooks, or with a delicate gesture, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction to be relieved.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	When water is introduced into the ear, it is necessary for the patient to use sneezing with the initial conditioning; and he has already filled his ear with some cooked wax. And he lies over that ear where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If it therefore exits through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many small stones, according to the length of your finger, thin and soft, and heat them with fire briefly, and let the patient insert one of them into his ear opening; and he should lift up from that side a little on his foot, and strike with another stone the stone that is in his ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	He should therefore continue doing that with the stone and the stone until all the water has exited.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And the water will exit in such a way that you take one from the hot water or the steam and insert its end into his ear; and light the other end with fire until it burns most of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then he should repeat the process with another cloth, and do that many times until all the water has exited; and then extract it with a tube as mentioned earlier in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	When extracting the animal that has entered it, if it is a small body, like a flea or something similar, treat it as I said regarding division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if there is a large body that appears to the senses, then perform its extraction with gestures and hooks, for it is easier than all those held in gold.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	However, when treating a spine generated in gold, if you take care of it as we said in division and distillation, and it does not respond to your treatment, then you should look at the gold in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If something appears there from the nerves, then extract it with gestures or with delicate hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	However, if nothing appears there from the nerves, then take a tube whose form is tight below and wide above, and insert its thin end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; then suck with it using strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do that many times until all the nerves come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	However, if they do not obey you to come out, then wrap the catheter around with wax, as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not come out with what I said, then perform distillations that the ancients are experienced in for the intersection of nerves, and you will find it in the treatise on distillation.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your discharge be as you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, the form of which is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you can see, make this one out of silver or bronze, tightly folded below, with a small opening on the inside and a larger one on top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	It should therefore be made such that it can push what is in the cavity of the tube; and it should be made neatly out of bronze.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a radius and insert its coated tip into the tube with proper lubrication; then pour oil or syrup or any of these medicines into the tube, and place it in the ear. Then insert the radius with the coating above, and express it gently with your hand until the oil is forced into the cavity of the ear and feels warm inside; but be careful not to allow anything cold to drip into it, for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	**On the Care of Treating an Injury to the Ear.**
Caput VII.	**Head VII.**
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants emerge from their mothers' wombs that have not been circumcised.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And indeed, it has also happened to some people that their ear tissue is damaged at birth from a wound or flesh growth within it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this operation is sometimes performed in a deep hole in the ear, which does not follow the usual method; and sometimes it happens on the outer part of the opening, and then it follows the usual method.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, what happens in the deep ear, and which does not fit within the scope of vision, is difficult to cure in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in those that follow the usual method, it is necessary to place a warm compress over the ear and examine it; then, if you see the operation appearing, open it with a fine probe, whose shape follows this, with its end where there is some small width, and one part of it acute; and the rest of the probe should be smooth on both sides so as not to hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the operation is caused by flesh grown in the ear canal, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it away easily until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the operation is in the deep ear, then take a thin, flexible probe and heat it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel the operation with what the patient feels with the weight of hearing, then try to open it easily; and be careful not to wound the ear's nerves.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a quantity of lint according to the size of the wound you have cleaned with Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are free from the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take the lint, and soak it in rosewater, then sprinkle over it powdered zinc, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see that the ear has already formed a crust, then it is necessary to remove the lint and allow it with the new lint you apply in the paste made with rose oil, until the crust is warm, then take care of it until it heals completely.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, there is bleeding: then soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the ear, and use the remaining cure that stops the flow of blood as described in the treatise on distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	**On the care of the eyelids.**
Caput VIII.	**Head VIII.**
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are the conditions that occur in the eyelids of the eye when they are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, it is necessary to hold them with tweezers or with a hook, and cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place a tri-cut veil over the wound.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	However, if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lens-shaped cauterizing iron.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterize them, it is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	Indeed, they often return when something remains from its roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	§ On the care of the eyes' grand muscles.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often it happens in the eyelids that something resembles the grand muscle in its strength and hardness, and because of that it is called Grandinus: and there is a thick aggregation of moisture in the upper eyelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	The operation on them is therefore to consider at that time, if the grand muscle proceeds from it, which appears from the eyelid, and moves to every part, then its condition is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, find the crack over it in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then he should scrape it from all parts with ease until it is healed.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	However, if you cannot prepare to cut it off except after you have pierced the eyelid with an incision slightly, then it will harm the weak patient somehow.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the cut is deep: then sew it up and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is minor, it will not cause you any harm from that.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	Blood will restore it and make it flesh again.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the decline is great towards the inner part of the ear away from the surface, then turn the eyelid inside out and hang the swelling with a hook; besides needing an incision, press it from all parts.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is elongated by an incision, it will not harm anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after cutting the swelling with mixed water and care for the place so that it becomes flesh again until the sick person is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	On the care of the axirna (eyelid) palpebrae (tissues).
Caput X.	**Chapter X.**
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	The axirna (eyelid fold) is a thickening that occurs in the upper eyelid skin. This most often happens to children, and it makes their eyes water in the morning, preventing them from seeing sunlight due to the tears, so they constantly rest their eyelids on their faces and sleep with them open, and the axirna becomes prominent and visible to the eye, and when you press on the area with your fingers, you feel the axirna between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its operation is to place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Next, take a linen cloth and prepare it with care, making a circle from it according to the amount that contains the axirna from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it over the axirna and press with your fingers from all sides so that the axirna is gathered together in the center of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that humidity with a spatula, opening the cracks across the width, and let there not be a deeper crack than that made in phlebotomy.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	You must find the skin entirely, until you reach the axira, for indeed the axira proceeds from the fissure according to the shape of the white, swollen fragment.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore, extract it with the cloth that you have inserted between your fingers towards the exterior, and turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed. Be careful not to add to the fissure, so that you can reach with the instrument to the eye, and do not injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	However, if the axira does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, add a little to the fissure with ease until the axira proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the site, and bind it with small strings.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are people who rub salt on it, and they place it into the depth of the fissure so that whatever remains from it dissolves because of that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however, there is an abscess at the site, then take care of it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	On the causes of eye atrophy, that is, when the eyelid softens the eye, causing it to bulge abnormally.
Caput XI.	**Chapter XI.**
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional hairs grow in the eyelids beyond their natural course beneath the skin, and they become old, they harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as frequent tears, eyelid softening, and clouding of vision, until that becomes the cause of eye destruction.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And eye atrophy is treated according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with sharp medicine, as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or eye atrophy is treated by cutting and stitching.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by tubes, as I will mention.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	You must place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it turns out well, so much the better.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not, insert a needle into it, where the thread is located at the lower part of the eyelid, and make it penetrate upwards with the thread, so that it comes close to the individual hairs themselves, that is, close to the margin of the eyelid, where the hairs are born; then pull the thread towards the upper parts with the eyelid, and turn it with the radius.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then, find the inner part of the eyelid, beneath the added hairs, with a spatula-like instrument, from the larger tear gland to the smaller one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then extract the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth beneath the eyelid; then mark on the eyelids with wax, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid, since it differs in humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	Indeed, there are those who need to have the eyelid incised with a large quantity, according to the amount that becomes soft from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, with the spatula, find the two lines you marked and begin from the larger tear gland to the smaller one, and let there be a single fissure near the natural hairs, according to the thickness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Next, introduce a hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then, scrape off the entire skin from that area.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then, sew together the two edges with a needle and fine thread, to stop the bleeding and allow the excess threads to adhere above the two eyebrows, for some things may puncture if you do that; and if not, take no concern.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then, leave the suture and thread until three or four days; after that, take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without stitching and care for it so that it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is lifted at the sealing of the wound and its aggregation, but it will improve in time.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	The ancients taught this method of healing.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is a concern about the patient's condition, and it comes from good practice, and there is no fear in that.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And there is another method in Ataxmir as well; it is like signs on the eyelids in the form of a figure that resembles a myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then elevate the eyelids with three hooks separated or joined, according to this form which follows, and then cut off the excess with small scissors, according to this form, with equality in the incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	However, if it is not possible for you to hold the hook or if it does not align, then take a sharp instrument with which there is a thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure, and insert another thread near the larger tear, and a second thread near the smaller tear, and join the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then elevate your hand equally, and raise the skin above which the mark is made, as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two lips of the wound with stitching, and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If indeed there is an abscess near your incision or fracture, fill it with gauze and similar materials, using healing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelids also turn, as if their hairs are converting.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, it is necessary to use what we have said about the wound: but the stitching of each (side) is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	**Concerning the care of the eye with dogs.**
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And thus, as you turn the eyelids and cut the gap that is inside, according to what I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then, with the artifice, make two tubes or two thin pieces of wood: whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of the space: and you have already cut at both ends on each side where you hold the thread.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then, join each with delicate threads over the excess of the eyelid and tighten the two tubes on both sides with a strong twist, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin, when tightened, will die, and turn black, and rot until it falls off on its own.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If, however, it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it is healed, raise the eyelid; and the hairs will no longer hurt.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of the two tubes that you will make according to this shape and size in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	On the elevation of sharp pilons in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	**Chapter XII**
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation consists of taking a thin needle and introducing it into the eye with a delicate, flexible thread.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather its ends together and tie each one with a very thin knot; the length of the threads should be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then take another thin thread and compose it beneath the first in a small knot, and tie the ends of it if visible.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then the patient should lay his head in your lap, close to the light, so that the operation may be shown, for it is a delicate and minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you extract it above the natural pilus.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up to above the thread and introduce the hair into the thread; if it is one, or two, or three, and not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out of the eyelid together with the thread and natural pilus.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If, however, the thread is withdrawn from the wound without the hair coming out with it: draw the hair to the lower part, using the thread which you have woven into it, until the hair emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with your eye; then draw both the hair and the thread, and close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate a longer thread with it from its natural hairs, and it will be lifted along with it; or leave it until it lengthens after some space, and then lift it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	§ On the care of the alxatrati (lidding) which occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this alxatrati (lidding) occurs in the eye, it is called leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this alxatrati (lidding) is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	The accidental alxatrati is caused by the healing of a wound, or its cutting or burning, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of treatment is that you should find that healing, and separate the lips, and place something between them, a kind of gap from linen, and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary to use in the treatment of this things that burn and contract, for if you do so, it will return to Alxatrati (Albucasis) in a worse condition than before; rather, use things that soften, such as fenugreek; mix with water in which cooked aloe is soaked, or linseed oil; and apply it with a poultice or use it for treatment.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is to preserve every intellect so that it does not harden according to its original form.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this very operation that we have mentioned is nothing but a correction of Albucasis, so that it does not return to the original form of the place at all.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	§ On the treatment of Albucasis (for) the lower eyelid, which is a swelling or contraction upward towards the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This treatment of Albucasis (for) what occurs below is what is truly called Albucasis.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is both natural and accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And accidental injuries occur from wounds, cracks, burning, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the way of operating is to take hold of a sharp instrument, where there is a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh towards the upper parts with the knife, and cut it with a broad scalpel.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If it then returns to the shape of the eyelid as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if it does not, take a radium (a pointed instrument) and insert it into the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it. Find two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of these fissures meet at the two angles of the incision, until they form an angle. Until this is achieved, when they are joined, the shape of these will be like a Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh along the length of its sharp lower side, from where it follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then join the separated parts, using a thread of linen.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the medicines that we have mentioned, and bandages, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an injury to the eyelid occurs from a fracture, and stitching or cauterization is required, then it is necessary to find the flat surface of the fracture beneath the eyelash, even as it was previously.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two eyelids with a sharp instrument, as we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And in summary, regarding the care of the eyelid, whether it is above or below, the treatment should proceed as prepared according to Albucasis's form.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	Indeed, it (the treatment) varies greatly in form: the skilled artisan prepares the tool in any way possible until they restore the figure to a natural or nearly natural form, and the patient themselves, as appropriate from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	§ On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	This hardening occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid hardens with the whiteness of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, it is necessary that you insert the tip of the instrument beneath the eyelid and lift it upwards, or extend it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharp but slightly blunt, so as not to disturb the patient during the operation, and remove the spatula, and harm the eye with its sharpness, and make the incision such that it frees that adhesion easily until, when the eyelid returns to its natural form, the whole adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then apply a salt water wash to the eye, and rinse it with water; or let it drip onto the eye from a sieve made of silk, dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Next, separate the eyelid and eye with a lint-free linen; place a compress soaked in albutylin on the eye, and use a sieve and compresses, strengthening them daily, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	§ On the cutting of the fingernail and the prominence of the flesh of the tears.
Caput XVI.	Head XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the fingernail is of two types.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	It is either nerve-like, similar to hard, yet delicate silk.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nerve-like, similar to the white frozen moisture; which when touched by hot iron or attempts to grasp it with a hook, it separates and does not adhere to the hook.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And neither of these types begins, unless from the tear gland, gradually increasing until it obstructs vision and blocks light, and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of cutting it is: place the weak head in your palm.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then he opens his eyes and lifts his eyelids with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather a finger with a hook having made it slightly thin, and extend it towards the upper part.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take some thread and insert a needle into it from the equine hair, or wool, or silk; make sure the thread is strong, and bend both ends of the needle slightly, then fix it in the middle of the finger: and pierce through with the needle, and tie the thread to the finger, and extend it towards the upper part: and scrape along the side of the finger nail that follows the pupil, as if you were grasping it with the thread until its very end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remaining part at the base of the tear duct with a fine scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that there is no continuous flow of tears from the cut.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the finger is extended with just a hook, or with thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it will be scraped with a soft scalpel whose shape is as follows.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful not to let the scalpel touch the corneal tunic, and cause it to tear or puncture the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, insert into the eye some crushed salt or a liquid made from zinc, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then, care for the wound with what is necessary until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nerve-related and you cannot insert a sharp instrument into it, nor is there a curved hook on it, then this type of nail often heals on its own with medicine, and it recovers as if divided.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you must cut it, then open the wound with a gentle, delicate, and weak edge according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the nail from above with precision and delicacy.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you notice that it thins and contracts, and the shape is impressed on it, then from this moment onwards, pour into the eye a liquid made from zinc, or red lead, or crushed salt; and bandage the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation on that part until it is completely removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot spot in the eye, then leave it alone and care for the affected area until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then perform a repeat operation on that part, using reason, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the eminence of the tear gland causes great harm to the eye, it should be suspended with a hook and cut from that part, but not the final cut, so as not to disrupt the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then apply a stop to the tears, either from a red eye or that caused by a foreign body, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	§ On the incision of Albucasis, and the flesh grown in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Head XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	In some human eyes, a red flesh grows together or is overlaid, until it covers the pupil, draws close to it, or squeezes it against the eyelids, and perhaps even turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a rose bud.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on it is also such that it places the weak head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open the eye and pull that flesh completely with suitable hooks towards it: and hold it with a forceps or tweezers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut into the flesh at the first point, until it is entirely finished with the scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful with the eye, so as not to hurt it during the operation; and let your cut be made where you are cutting it, or with a spatula, which we have described in the section on the nail cut, or with small shears, with which the lint is gathered, according to its form after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your cut is complete and the entire wound has been cleaned, then apply to the eye an external compress with crushed salt mixed with red dust from medicinal powders, or similar substances, and place it over the eye to protect it from heat and inflammation.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If there remains some of the wound and you have a hot blood flow, and you fear a hot inflammation; then leave the eye and treat it with what soothes the inflammation.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And likewise do with the added flesh that occurs in the eye from this cause.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that the cure for every weak eye, whether from natural or accidental causes, should be operated on with a tool and not with bare hands; and you should not attempt any of these operations unless you first understand that this member can endure such an operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	On the collection of fluid from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	**Chapter XVIII.**
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	The sebel (or veins) are red and swollen, lying over the eye, preventing the flow of tears and weakening the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, you must first consider whether the eye containing the sebel is strong and free from any illness other than that related to the sebel, and then collect the sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is advisable to instruct the patient to place his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then, suspend those veins with a hook or two, according to your judgment: the hook should be thin and flexible, shaped as follows, or there can be two hooks joined together in one body, also shaped as shown.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then, carefully collect those veins with fine forceps and clean them hour by hour until you see the veins moving away from the eye and are resolved; be careful not to harm the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And perform the operation in the middle of the day, facing the sun, and be firm in your operation so as not to cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have washed it, then let it trickle into the eye either with a green or red substance; so that its acuteness may corrode what remains of the grease.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	However, if it is not possible for you to collect all of that in that moment, then apply a poultice to the eye with something that alleviates the pain of the eye, and leave it for several days until the pain subsides; and protect it from further harm by heat. Then repeat over it in the same manner until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	§ On the reduction of an abscess to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Head 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The surgeons of abscesses make a fistula, which they treat with cautery or with sharp medicine, according to what has been said before.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in that; unless you find a fissure near its origin and extract all the moisture and pus within it until the wound is closed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackening in it, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is as follows.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	It is called the Hardness of the Head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Go in with the iron, and make the head round like an apple, marked by a fine cut of the knife or a subtle point of the chisel, and place it over the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then take it between your fingers and gently press with your hand until you know that the corruption is completely smooth, and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with dry aromatic medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the place hardens and flesh grows, and the flow of pus ceases, and it remains for forty days without renewal or relapse, then know that it is healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if this does not happen, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nasal opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is necessary to remove from the bone with iron or sharp medicine, and once the bone is exposed, then take a drill according to this form, let the iron end be triangular, and the wood of its pyramid be thinned towards the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on the bone itself, and let it be near the tear duct, and stretch your hand slightly from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then resolve to move your hand with the knife, until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it; through this, he will find the strength to exit from it, when he holds his own hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, at that point, restore the place with styptic medicines that dry up, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When the flesh is formed and the place hardens, then the matter that was exuded to the outside returns to the nose; thus, it becomes softer over the patient.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	## On Reducing Eyelid Protrusion
Caput XX.	**Head XX.**
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with its entire mass, and there is no pain or loss of vision, then you should relieve the patient; then use phlebotomies; afterwards, apply a flow of air to the eyelid without scarring but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the eye a liniment made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then close the eye with a bandage over it, using many small threads.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method for these threads is as follows: take many soft cloths, and make each cloth double over four times; then make many from them; then place them one on top of the other according to the amount needed for the eye; finally, bind them tightly with a strong, hard cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And they also operate on flowing blood without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the blood flow and allow the eye to rest day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	However, if the ligature becomes softer again, it should be bound tightly; then, after a day and night, remove the ligature as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see that the eye has regained its new skin, it is good; and if not, repeat the plaster, threads, binding, and bleeding until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	## On the Incision of the Skin's Layer
Caput XXI.	**Chapter 21.**
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When there is a tear in the skin's layer, it protrudes and extends beyond the eyelids like a grain, causing disfigurement due to that, and one should incise it; then the operation on it is as I describe: and it is as if you insert a sharp point into the root of the lid from below upwards.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Next, introduce another knife where the thread is double from the tearful side, and cause it to penetrate. And leave the first knife according to its arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Next, incise the location of the double thread, and tie with it the edge of the needle in a circular motion: and tighten it greatly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Next, extract the knife, and place on the eye a linen cloth soaked in alum: and leave it until the thread falls with the eye.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, so that it is strengthened, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the thread is tightened from all sides in a circular motion with the cloth, until the eye gains great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Next, it is pierced with a fine instrument that reaches the depth of the eye, and the humidity of the alum runs out, and the eye descends and enters immediately: then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	**On the cure of alum (or eye disease)**
Caput XXII.	Head XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease called alum is not, but a health condition that is aggregated in the eye, similar to water running down, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operation is such that you make the invalid sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head in both hands and move it until you think the blood has reached the lower part of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is secured so that it does not drop, and the light is released; and the invalid sees things as he saw them before: and if it does not come down below, then know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	However, if the descent of the blood is not prepared as we said, then make the invalid sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin spatula and find it with the above skin fold just above the connection of the joint with the corneal tunic in the crown, until the blood flows out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When the blood has thus flowed out, then pour warm water into the eye, in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then it is treated with the rest of the cure until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	§ On the care of water that flows into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have previously described the types of water in division, and what is suitable for piercing, as explained and expounded in the discourse, then take that same one according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Therefore, you should make the sick person sit with their face square between your hands, opposite to the light, towards the sun, and bind their healthy eye tightly; then, with your right hand, if the eye with water is on the left, hold the left eye, or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then, take your right hand with the alum, if the eye is on the left, or your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then, place the end of the alum near the edge, by the thickness of the radius, on the same white eye appearing lacrimal smaller; then push the alum with strength; and you return with it in your hand, until it penetrates into the eyeball: and you will feel that the alum has already reached the vacuum.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the journey of the alum to the depth should be measured, as much space there is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will indeed see that in the same pupil vision of the eye, due to the clarity of the cornea tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the alum until it reaches the place where water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press the same below with one hand after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the patient will see it over which he opens his wound immediately, and alum in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then lay it down again the second time, besides what alum comes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When it is thus fixed, and does not rise up: then draw out the alum with ease: and you return your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water some of the clear salt of the stone, and wash with it the inside of the eye.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put on the eye entirely the poultice, or wool steeped in rose oil, and alum too: and bind it with a healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those of our time, put on it ground cumin with alum.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the surgeon does not obey you and enters the eye without softening it because of its hardness, which comes from human flesh, whose eye is very hard, then he should take a spatula called "Alberid," which has this form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, when handling it, connect only the joint itself and not your entire hand into the wound, and there should be only a narrow space for the spatula to enter.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then insert the spatula as we said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And for the completion of your work, prepare a dark room for the patient, in which he sleeps on his back; forbid all movements and coughing; give him that food by which his nature is soothed; and do not allow him to move his head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And the bandage should be left according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then remove it in that dark room and examine his sight; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary for him to do that at the time of healing or immediately after incision; rather, he should wait until a foreign body is introduced, because water rises quickly through an open wound.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary to drain the eye before the seventh day; and straighten it with that which calms the abscess until it is calm; then release the sight of that eye, and place over its surface a poultice to regulate its sight for several days while it remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then it should gradually leave the house and return to its case.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in zeal the student is not excused from sight for some time; then indeed he should dare to engage in surgery.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed, some of those from Al-Andalus have now reached us, who say that a certain pierced magdan, through which water is drawn, has been done in Al-Andalus.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Therefore, no one has ever been seen in our land to have done that; nor is it written about in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species from magda, so that one who ignores them may stand on them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of their own air; and let the ends of them be triangular with the same subtle angle, and the end acute.
Formae magda.	Great forms.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	On the care of flesh grown in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Head XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes various kinds of flesh are produced in the nose, from which some is like a scorpion with many feet; and from this there arises cancerous, hard flesh, of a dark colour; and from this there arises soft flesh, not of a dark colour.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, with regard to that flesh which is soft, neither putrid nor cancerous, you should make it lie between your hands facing upwards and open the nostrils, then insert a hook into those meats; after that, pull them out towards the exterior, and cut what you have seized from them with a thin and sharp blade on one side, until you know that all the flesh has already been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains of that which cannot be separated, then cut it with a thin instrument easily until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood dominates you or a feverish abscess occurs: then oppose it with what is necessary; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then apply cauterization to it until the blood is drained and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Next, after making an incision, pour vinegar and water or wine into the nose.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	However, if the nose opens up and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If indeed moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that there is flesh grown within the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Therefore, you should insert a line of thread that has some thickness and knots on it; place the space between each knot equal to a finger, or less, and twist the weak end of the thread into the nose with a hook, or something similar, and pull until it reaches the cavity, and comes out from its opening.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And indeed, many young children do this like atoms in schools; and it is an easy thing for whoever wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then, place both ends of the thread; one end that comes out from the nose and the other end that remains inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then, using the help of the knots on the thread, close the wound with the flesh.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is sealed with the knots on the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then extract the thread and place it in the nose after diverting the blood flow with the ointment you applied from Egypt. Do this for three days or longer until the ointment has completely dissolved what remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then, after some days, insert a lead pipe into the nose until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	However, if further treatment is needed to stop the bleeding, use it.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make the head purification, with which oils are distilled and other medicines into the nose, make it from silver or brass, in the form of a small lamp, opened like a conch shell, and its passageway similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make the pipe closed like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the conch shell of the head purification instrument should be full and open; it should have a handle at the end with which to hold it when heating oil or whatever you want to insert, or substances that can flow.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	**On the care of the nose.**
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many times a lump is born at the end of the nose, and it swells and grows with the passing days, until an agreement is reached about its appearance.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of that, it is necessary to cut off that lump at the beginning of its appearance and remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then apply a poultice, or a burn dressing, or a burning medicine that takes its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If the incision is delayed until the lump has swelled and its appearance has changed, then consider whether it is hard, firm, dark in colour, and has little sensation; if so, do not touch it with the blade, for it is a malignant tumour.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Many times I have seen those who have cut off a malignant lump, and great evil has come from it to him who had that one.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the lump is soft to touch, not dark in colour, and you see that an incision can be made throughout it, then encourage the sick person, and cut off the lump without fear or hesitation; and treat the place with something that draws out and constricts it until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	§ On the stitching of the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You should know that when there is a separation of the connection in one of these cartilage tissues, little surgical treatment is required for it, except in certain cases.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something like this happens to anyone, you should consider if it is a recent wound still oozing its own blood. Then, stitch together the wounds with cautery and afterwards take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the connection of the lips has already separated and one part becomes healthy, then it is necessary to clean all the parts appearing from the skin until they bleed.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then stitch together the two lips with sutures and tighten them, and apply over it dragon's blood and powdered frankincense; place above the wound a fragment of an ointment pad, and use another from consolidant plasters. And leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it, change the medicine, and leave it until the threads come out by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of stitching is to gather the connection of the cartilage, or with a pad, as we mentioned about the stitches of the stomach; or to gather the separation with threads, as you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the extraction of lip nodules.
Caput XXVII.	**Chapter XXVII**
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many men suffer from hard protrusions within their lips, often resembling small or large grains of herb, and some are more painful than others.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary to turn the lip and find the top of each nodule, and suspend it with a hook, and cut it off from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then, after the cut, apply pressure with a clean cloth until the bleeding stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then, it should be washed with vinegar, and the place treated with it where there is stiffness, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	On the incision of flesh grown over the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	**Chapter XXVIII**
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Flesh often grows over the gum, which the ancients call an abulsion.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, it is necessary to suspend it with a hook, or hold it with tweezers, and cut it near its root, allowing the discharge of pus or blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place a third covering over the wound, or other sticky poultices, dry and excoriating.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If the flesh returns to its former state after treatment, as it often does, then cut it away a second time and cauterize it; for indeed, it will not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	§ On the reason for teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Head 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes teeth become attached to the surface from both the inner and outer parts, and between the gums there are rough and painful cortices, which sometimes turn black and yellow, and become bright, until finally corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through that.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you must make the patient sit between your hands, and rest his head in your lap, and scrape away the roughness and tooth, where you can see the cortices, like sand; until nothing remains of them, and do the same with blackness, whiteness, yellowing, and others until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore what is in them from the beginning of the reason can be removed, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on them another day, a second time, and a third, until the ultimate study in what you wish has been reached.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you should know that the tooth needs to be cut with various forms of instruments, in accordance with what is prepared for your operation; for the instrument that cuts through the tooth from below is different from the one that cuts between the teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of instruments should be prepared for you as you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	**On the Extraction of Teeth Pain**
Caput XXX.	**Chapter XXX**
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You should cure a tooth from its pain with all skill, and take your time in extracting it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For indeed, I have seen that its pain does not subside when it is extracted, since it is a noble substance; until there is no excuse for extracting it, then when the patient is compelled to extract it, as it should be strengthened and verified by you, the painful tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	Many times the patient is deceived by its pain, and thinks that it is relieved in the tooth and extracts it; then the pain does not cease until the infected tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen that from the work of bloodletting instruments.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	If a toothache is confirmed within your gums with pain, then you must perform incisions around the affected tooth with a scalpel, which has something of sharp quality, until the gum is completely dissolved from all sides; then gently move it with your fingers or with subtle pincers in the beginning gradually, until it detaches.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then locate large pincers and grasp the lower jaw between your fingers; hold it firmly so that it does not move. Then pull on the tooth straightwards, avoiding to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and insert them beneath it from all sides easily, and try to move it as you did before.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	However, if the tooth is perforated or corroded, then you must fill that hole with cloth and tie it with a thin end of a wire so as not to break it during your squeezing with pincers on top.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary to be careful with incisions around the gums from all sides much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And preserve your strength so as not to break it and let a part of it remain, and return from that malady which causes the greatest pain for it initially.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, do not do what uninformed bloodletters do in their haste and boldness about its removal, except that they administer what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many times they cause great infirmities in men to develop, which are more difficult to break and leave all or some of their roots intact, or so that they extract it along with certain bones of the mandible, as we have often witnessed.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be washed after the removal with wine, or vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If bleeding occurs from the wounds (which often happens), press something against it and fill the space with that, or if not, cauterize it if it does not stop bleeding.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The pliers should have long tips, a short handle, and be made of sturdy metal so that they do not double over when pressed against a tooth; they should resemble the handles of large pliers until, when you squeeze them, they do not bend or double over themselves. They should have sharp points at their ends, some of which enter certain spaces and grip firmly with constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when the tips take on the shape of the curved beak called a forceps, they become strong tools for grasping.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	§ On the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured jawbone.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When there remains, near the extraction of a tooth that breaks something, then it is necessary to place over the site a custom bandage with butter for one or two days, until the place becomes soft; then insert the proper forceps or pincers, whose ends are similar to the beak of what is called a forcep.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The shape of these forceps is as follows:
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	The ends of these forceps are made like a chisel or a knife blade.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If, therefore, it does not yield to you when using these forceps, then you must apply leverage over the root and remove all the flesh, and insert an instrument called a small lever, whose shape is as follows.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	It should have a short end, slightly thicker; it must not be soaked, lest it break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If, therefore, the root comes out through it, it is good; if not, leverage must be applied with other instruments of this shape.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The shape of the first end is triangular, with some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The triangular end is delicate.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It is also incised with this instrument having two branches, whose form is as follows.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that preceded it in terms of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It is also a saw with this instrument that resembles a large hook, with curved ends of a triangular shape, which has some thickness to it so as not to break, and it should not be oiled.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you should know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly, the other tools are not counted, and a skilled craftsman, subtle in his art, found this very instrument himself, according to which he understands the operation and illnesses themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because from the illnesses to which they (teeth) are subject, there were no instruments mentioned by the ancients, due to the diversity of those species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	However, if the bone breaks from the jaw or from any other bones of the mouth, or it decays: then examine that place with him (the surgeon) using the instruments and pincers suitable for extracting roots, and treat with gestures, whose form is as follows.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	In that, put some thickness gradually, so as to tighten or hold the bone, and not let it escape or waste away, until the bone is extracted, and restore the place with suitable medicines for that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is a small putrid bone, then cut it away from its putrefaction and treat it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	On the projection of the prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Head XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When the teeth project not according to their natural course, an unsightly form results from it: and especially when this happens in women and girls, that is, in those with thin jaws.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary that you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth grows after another tooth, and does not move or become loose, then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, which has the following shape.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It has a similar appearance to a small face, and is made of iron bent, with very acute ends.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And your cut should be such that you cut it for many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so as not to disturb any other teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	However, if it is prominently exposed and its edge can be filed: then file it with a file made of iron, whose shape is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Sit entirely from the indus, and its handle of small punctured points like a liming tool with which pins are made; with it, the tooth is gently filed day after day until it smooths out without disturbing the tooth or causing it to fall out; then make it soft, finally polish it with certain rasors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If there is a tooth, from which a part breaks off and injures the tongue, then it must be filed further until its roughness due to the fracture is removed and it becomes smooth; it should be smoothed without injuring the tongue or corrupting speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	**On the Relationship of Teeth with Golden Threads**
Caput XXXIII.	**Head XXXIII.**
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth suffer a shock or displacement due to impact or accident, and the weak patient cannot hold onto what he chews to prevent it from falling out, and treatment with astringent medicines does not help: then there is a trick to make them cling together with golden thread. Since silver turns green and rots after a few days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And the thread should be of medium thickness, according to the amount that can fit between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	As for the method of threading, take the thread and insert its double length between two healthy teeth; then weave the ends of the thread between the moving teeth, one or more, until you reach the meshwork up to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texture up to the part from which you started, and tightly hold your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not moved at all, and let your compression at the point where you are tying the thread, near the roots of the teeth, be such that it does not slip.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors, and gather them together, and twist them with your fingers, and insert them between the healthy tooth and the moving tooth, so as not to harm the tongue, then release it so that it remains tightly held.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it is however loosened or cut, tie them again with another thread, and let it remain thus for a long time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of teeth, and the arrangement of two healthy teeth and two moving teeth, as you can see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And whenever a tooth or two return to their original position after falling out in their places, and remain as we have described, it is done only by an artist, prudent and skilled.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And whenever some suitable bone is obtained from a corpse, it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the position from which the tooth is supported and tightened, as we have said, and remains, and serves with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	§ Regarding the cutting of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speaking.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes the ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is to open the lower jaw at its base in your palm, and lift up his tongue; then cut through that nerve ligament across its width until the tongue is released from its attachment.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something of hardness and knotting in it, resulting from the healing of a wound, then insert an hook into it and find its width, until you cut through the ligament and the knot is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be careful, so that there is no tear in the deep flesh, and cut through the artery there, and let there not be a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then the wound should be washed with rosewater, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a piece of linen that will hold it open at night so that it does not heal again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If, however, there is a flow of blood, then place over the wound a torn cloth.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If indeed blood clings to you, then cauterize the place with a lentiginous cautery, which is appropriate for it; then treat it as you would any other wound, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	On the extraction of the ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Head XXXIV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes a swelling occurs under the tongue that resembles a small ranula, preventing the tongue from its natural movement, and it may even become so severe that it blocks the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the treatment for it is to open the lower jaw before the sun, and consider the swelling.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see that it is of a pale or black colour, hard, and lacks feeling, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it has dipped to whiteness with humidity, then throw a hook at it and cut it off with a thin instrument, freeing it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If indeed blood clings to it during your operation, then place a crushed, third-degree bandage over it until the blood lets go; afterwards, return to your operation until you have completely extracted it along with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be washed with vinegar and salt, and the rest of the cure should correspond to that treatment until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	§ On the treatment of an aptham (edema) of both amygdales.
Caput XXXVI.	Head XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur in the throat, glands similar to cotton, which appear externally, and are called two amygdales. If these do not heal when treated as we have said, then consider them.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore the aptham is of a dark color, firm to the touch, and has little sensation, then do not attempt to treat it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a red color, and the root is thick: then do not touch it with iron either, fearing blood loss, but instead let it stand until it heals properly.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either pierce it or it will break on its own.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white color, round, and the root is thin: then you must cut into it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is such that you should consider before your operation if the aptham's heat has completely subsided or diminished in any way, then afterwards make the patient sit before the sun, and place his head in your lap, open his mouth, and with a tool of this form, press his tongue from below.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Make it from silver or brass, which should be as thin as a knife blade.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	So, when you have placed it (the appendage) in the wound and it sinks into it, your finger should then be removed using a hook and fixed in a groove, and pulled out as far as possible without pulling on the skin.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with the instrument, whose shape follows this one.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is cut with shears; however, its ends should be protected so that the hole of each one is in direct contact with the sharp point of the other, thereby ensuring it is made of iron-wrought or soaked alum.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a knife, whose shape follows this one.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It should be sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one groove, cut the other according to this same pattern of cutting.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	After the cutting, then wash the patient with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, there is bleeding, wash with water in which bark of the hemlock or similar astringent leaves have been boiled until the flow of blood stops; then take care of it until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses are born in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, cut those according to what I have said about the cutting of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And indeed I have already treated a woman from an abscess that had been born between her throat, which was drawing towards blackness, with little feeling, which had almost closed her throat; and the woman was breathing through a narrow opening, and had forbidden herself food and drinking water; and she had already reached the point of death, if she had not recovered within one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess will only rise as far as it has emitted two branches, until they have emerged above the two nasal openings.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore proceeded with greater haste, and fixed one of the hooks into one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it straight, and the portion that was torn out from it is a large one.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I severed it where it was caught in the nasal opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same thing to the other one that had emerged from the second nasal opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue; then I fixed the hook into the abscess itself; then I severed from it that part of it, and nothing more came out of it but a little blood: thus the throat of the woman is healed, and she began to drink water immediately, and then accepted food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to cut away from that gap many times over a long period of time, and the gap was succeeded by the place where I had cut, until it became too prolonged and as a result, that gap.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore devised a way and cauterized the gap between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stopped bleeding; then I walked away from it, and I did not know what God had done with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	§ On the incision of the skin gap.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the phlegm descends to the skin and forms a gap, which is long, then it is called "perpendicular"; and if it is in the lower part thick and round, then it is called "uua".
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with what we have said about the division, and treatment does not help; and you see that the gap has become calm and thin, then it is necessary to cut it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is aggregated from it in a round shape, and does not have length, and is of a bloody or dark or black colour, and has no sensation, then you must make an incision into it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	There is fear in it concerning the sick.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I have described, by its whiteness and length, make the sick sit before the sun, and press his tongue with the instrument of which mention has previously been made; then attach a hook to it and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments I have mentioned in cutting the two glands.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from it unless that which is added to the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you will injure the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	After the cutting, use what we have mentioned in cutting the two glands, and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If, however, the sick is disturbed by the cut: then you must use skill in sealing it without fear and trepidation.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	The manner of cauterization in it is not otherwise than with sharp water; and it is as if you place the head of the sick in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument I mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take water as I have told you in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with a paste of unextinguished lime, not too thick or too thin, and fill up this cavity of the instrument, which has this form.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Place the tip of it at the place where the medicine is to be applied, as the cavity of the radius bone.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on that very same wound: and let the patient lie on his side so that the salt from his mouth flows out due to the medicine's inherent action, lest any of it descend into his throat and harm himself.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And from the first, place it over the wound with a quantity sufficient for half an hour, until you perceive that it has already turned black and the bite of the medicine is subdued.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take off the poultice and cover it again over the end of the radius, and insert the rayon with the poultice into a tube above, until the poultice adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times until you achieve what you wish from the cauterization of the new (wound).
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then release her; for she will heal and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to apply further medicine, apply the same to it; and after cauterization, clean around the new wound with butter-soaked cotton and purify it with what is left from the medicine; then wash it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it will heal from the outside with bandages, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This, therefore, is the kind of healing that is more salutary and less fearful.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the wound heals even better than with burning or cutting; for it heals with fumigation, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calament, hyssop, oregano, rue, fennel, chamomile, and tansy, and other similar herbs; mix them all together, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them in vinegar, allowing them to bubble: the pot should be sealed with decent clay; and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or brass; and the end with the grenade should be inserted into the mouth until the vapor rises to the upper part through the tube, blocking the wound a lot.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat this process many times over the same area until it heals.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And moreover, do not perform this cure at the onset of the apoplexy.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For indeed, it adds pleasure to the apoplexy: and you should not perform that unless near the decline of the apoplexy's heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If, however, this instrument is not present to you, then take a cane, and fasten a piece of wood at its end, so that it does not burn the weak bone, for the wood prevents the vapor from burning the bone; and this is from good cure with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	§ On the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Head XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often, a bone, or a fish spine, or something else adheres in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, you must extract what is apparent from them, after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the sun, and it will be declared to you whether something is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before the food digests in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the condition will be expelled through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	If the patient swallows a fragment of raw naph (a type of plant), or a root of lettuce, or chews but does not swallow a dry crumb of bread, he may take instead a piece of soft, dry seaweed and wrap it in thread, then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When, therefore, he reaches the place where there are spines or bones, and extracts them, then he is cured.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If, therefore, it does not come out as we said, then use an instrument of lead in this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	It should be larger than the radius by a little, and its end should be sharpened so that it is easily inserted into the patient's throat; and he himself should keep his head raised upward.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And he should be careful with the touch of his epiglottis, so that he does not experience coughing, and pushes out with it a bone or a spine, or the doctor himself inserts it by hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	Indeed, it is better for the patient to insert it himself, because of his knowledge of the place where the condition is attached, and he pushes it down or pulls his hand up with the instrument until it comes out completely according to the amount that was prepared for him.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	On the extraction of the bloodsucker.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the bloodsucker is treated with what I have mentioned regarding division from cure with medicines, and it does not improve, then consider the drop of the weak tongue before the sun, or near the sun after you have placed your instrument on it as I told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your hook slips off the bloodsucker, extract it with a small hook or with delicate gestures.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with these [instruments], then take a hollow pipe and insert it into the weak tongue up to near the throat: then insert into the hollow of the pipe a heated iron tip with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do that many times, and the weak person should abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then take a full cup of cold water and open the person's mouth with it: and have them suck their own tongue in it, and not swallow anything from it: and move the water every hour from one to another with their hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	The bloodsucker indeed falls immediately when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If, however, he does not leave with what we have described, then smother the sick with lice or with wings and an instrument, as I described for the suffocation of a fly.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, because it will fall itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the mode of operation in suffocation is to take a pot, in which there are live coals with fire; and let the pot be covered with a cover, in whose middle there is an opening; and arrange the end of the instrument in that opening.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then release the suffocation, and have the sick person place their mouth at the end of the tube, and close their mouth so that the suffocation does not escape, until you know that the suffocation has reached the blood vessel.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the blood vessel will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat the suffocation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the sick person will endure thirst, and eat spicy foods, and others, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, it is necessary to leave with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the blood vessel is extracted from the throat when it falls on that surface.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that there is a certain curvature which extends to the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the beak of what is called a forceps, in which there is a rough edge; when it grips something, it does not let go of it completely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	§ On the opening of wounds (apopthema), their incision, and general care.
Caput XL.	Head XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many kinds of wounds (apopthema), varying according to the manner in which they present themselves, namely, one kind and one alone is discussed in this book; and they differ in their punctures and incisions in two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of the kinds of wounds is from a specific type of aperture (apopthema) itself, and because it absorbs moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	The second manner (of incision) is according to the places where it happens on the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Since the wound (apopthema) occurring in the head is different from that occurring in the anus; and a wound occurring in a fleshy part is different from one occurring in joints; and each has its own judgment according to its operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And there are those which should not be pierced unless after the purification of the discharge within them and its completion; and these are those which must be pierced while they are still raw and do not complete their maturation according to their due course.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As for the abscesses that are close to the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when an abscess occurs close to a joint and persists until the pus within it putrefies, the surrounding ligaments or nerves of that joint might become corrupted; hence, it is a cause for closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a principal member; for if you delay piercing it until it matures, it will harm either that one or the principal member through it.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near a bowel; therefore, pierce the raw abscess that has not yet completed its digestion, only if it is near a bowel to prevent deep putrefaction and to extend towards the interior of the anus, thereby creating a fistula or ending in a condition that does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	You must know the time for piercing the abscess that has matured according to its course; and it is indicated by the relief of pain, the decrease in fever, and the diminution of redness, pulse, and sharpness of the abscessed head; and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And you must make the same perforation in the lower part of the apostema and of the more prominent eminence; and it should be a piercing cut along the length of the body, if the apostemata are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	However, in those that reflect, pierce according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When the apostema is in fleshy places: then it is better to leave off the piercing until its healing is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there is much pain and swelling, and perhaps its lips become hardened, and its depth increases.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And certain apostemata are pierced according to the width of the body where it is necessary, or according to that which the member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary to administer in small apostemata a small piercing, and in large apostemata a large piercing: or many sections according to the similarity of the size of the apostema.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are apostemata where it is necessary to make the skin hollow: and it is cut when it has already formed as a cloth, and has become in the end that it is dead, such as happens in many cases, as it shrinks, and in gonorrhoea.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And from them are those that are cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from them is that from which it is incised as the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As the scrotal hernia.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from them are those in which a round section is administered, and a lunar section; and similar sections to these.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That, however, which has no head, as are the soft hernias on the surface, should be treated with a single or merely shallow perforation.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when the hernia is large and has already absorbed much blood, and you make a single perforation, so as not to tear it and drain all the pus at that time; on the contrary, remove part of it from that very place.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then, bandage the hernia until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then, remove something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this many times according to the degree, until it protrudes; especially if the patient is weak of will, or a pregnant woman, or a very young child, or an old person who has declined: for the animal spirit often leaves the body with the discharge of pus, and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, this chapter demands great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, through which you make these incisions, it is necessary to cleanse the wound; and consider this:
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the appendage is small or there is a flat cut, then apply a poultice of lint or an old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if it is a large fistula and there are many cracks from the perforation, then you should introduce lint into each crack until they heal completely.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin in the fistula or torn it in the surrounding area, then you should fill it with an old cloth or as when a cloth is woven, or cloth lint from dry linen and tighten it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove the bandage and care for it as necessary with ointment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If, however, there is bleeding during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after which a cloth should be soaked in them and placed on the place of the bleeding numerous times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If, however, the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer treatments and care, and use the poultices and substances I have mentioned in many places in this book, and according to division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	However, if it is in the winter season and the site of the abscess involves many nerves, then you should insert small threads with wine and hot oil and place them on the affected area.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	But if it is summer and the sites are fleshy, then you should apply threads soaked in water and oil, or wine and oil to them all, while they are cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then you should open up the abscess, wash it, and apply whatever is suitable for its cure until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the cure for abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the way of distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess, how the path to its cure is described individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	**On the Abscesses that Occur on the Skin of the Head.**
Caput XLI.	Head 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur on the head skin and are of a kind that involves sacs contained within layers of skin, as if they were small chicken eggs.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many kinds of them.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	From them come rich ones; and from them are those that contain moisture similar to clay; and from them are those that contain moisture similar to ointments and poultices; and others of a similar kind, and from them are the hard stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in all these cases, there is no fear of extraction as long as the artery does not contradict during the cutting of them.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in the cutting of them is that you should experience these with an instrument whose shape comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if there is that which contains moisture, then dry it with the cutting according to the length of the superficial section: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the cutting from line B to line G. When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape away the crust that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything completely detached from it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For often it returns if anything remains of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the bandage in Egyptian ointment, if it is available; and if not, in water and salt: and apply it to the wound, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	Indeed, it corrodes what remains from a cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then it repeats over the top with a cotton cloth from Egypt, second and third times, and if you need to do that, continue until you trust that nothing remains from the cyst, then indeed treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If it contains a thick nodule: then dry it according to this form, cutting with a shape like a cross, and throw hooks between the two halves of the cut, and scrape it from all sides, and use your strength to remove the tunic that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	However, if it causes you opposition from an artery, then do what I will tell you afterward.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly, for an abscess, if it is hard like a stone, cut it out and cure it according to what we said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the cutting above an abscess that is hard like stone is easier, because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are certain of these abscesses that are in the head of some men, where there is no moisture whatsoever.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	This is because I followed an abscess in the head of a young woman, and found it like a hard, solid stone, rough, white, which could not be broken, and if anyone threw something at it, it would wound itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other cases of apostemas (deformities) occurring in the head, except for those that occur in the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, their removal should all be a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make an opening (perforation) always from their lower part, so that the flow of pure (body) fluids towards below is not hindered.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then care for them as is appropriate for their condition from treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	§ On the section of strophules (lumps) on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Head 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These apostemas (deformities) often occur in the neck, and under armpits, and groins: and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And there are many (kinds of) deformities above those that occur in the neck, some singular and others numerous, and they originate from one another; and every lump (strophula) from them is within its own sheath, as with the nodules and deformities of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the types of these deformities (strophula) are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And indeed, there are some that are hard (lapidary), and some contain moistures (humidities), and others are malignant (malignant), which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that part, therefore, which you see to be of good disposition in touch, whose proximity to the skin's color is evident, and it moves towards every part, and is not attached with the nerves of the neck, nor with the tendons, nor with the arteries, nor is it deep: it is necessary that you cut it with a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b. to a line, g., and scrape it from every side, and extend two flaps of skin with a hook, or with many hooks if needed, as we said in the abrasions of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is above all caution that the vein or nerve not be injured.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the instrument be not too sharp: so as not to give you a hand with the cut or disturb the patient, and make an unnecessary cut.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If however you cut a vein, or an artery, and it hinders the operation, then apply a third-degree pressure bandage, or some powdery substances that stop the flow of blood, and compress the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides, and the wound becomes softened: otherwise it will begin to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	Since the blood is stopped by the bandage, turn again to your operation until it is completed.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then, use your index finger to feel if any remaining particles of the abscess are present; so cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein in the root of the strophula, then it is necessary not to cut that strophula from its root; on the contrary, it is necessary to tie it with a strong doubled thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with more of the same Egyptian ointment that you had already applied.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the strophula is completely cut off, then it is necessary to gather the two lips of the wound and close them immediately as soon as you see that there is no excess left.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	However, if you see that there is excess left due to the size of the strophula, then it is necessary to prepare to cut its root and extract it; and administer the stitch as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And for those strophulas that contain moisture, make a superficial perforation in them so that you can see the place of their maturity; and then make another perforation starting from below the body as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then after the perforation, apply a linen cloth with ointment and similar things to corrode what remains from the corruption, until you see that the wound is already clean; then take care of yourself with a generation-type ointment for the flesh until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On the incision of the epiglottis through an opening within the throat by accident.
Caput XLIII.	**Chapter XLIII**
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients spoke of this incision into the epiglottis, and they knew of no one in our land who had performed it; and this is the writing of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In cases of strangulation, the incision of the epiglottis must be made with care; if it is not done carefully, then because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	In those who have a hot aperture in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, without any obstruction in the channels, it is necessary to use the incision of the epiglottis to avoid the destruction that occurs due to inflammation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to make the incision of the epiglottis, we must cut it under three or four circles of the epiglottis with a small section in width, at the place that is between the two circles, in such a way that the incision be on the side (since it is enclosed by meat, and the vessels of blood are far from there).
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the physician is timid, then he must extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then it finds the wound, until it reaches the canal: it should open the vessel of blood if it sees anything coming out from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then it cuts through the part we have described: and this is indicated above the section of the canal from which phlegm comes out, when it breaks and separates from it.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When, therefore, the time comes when it is feared that the wound will close, gather together the two edges of the skin of the wound, and leave it alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer the medicines that cause the flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	In conclusion, as we have described, the exposition is not complete unless they see that one of these conditions has already saturated the throat of the patient; and the sick person is lifted up above death, and desires to be cut open, so that the patient breathes through the wound in some way, and is saved from death. And for this reason, they hastened to leave the wound open until the malady is consumed, and it lasts for three days, and as if it were itself; then they hastened to close the wound and care for themselves until they are healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I have seen myself is that a nurse takes up the knife, and sends it into her throat, and cuts with it part of the pulmonary artery.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I have been called upon for the treatment of this condition, and I find her moaning, as is the moan of a dying person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore detected a wound, and I found blood that had emerged from the wound of the lung.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	I am therefore confused that she did not cut the vein, nor tie it off; and air was coming out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore prepared, and treated my own wound, until it was healed; and the nurse suffered nothing, except a hoarse voice: and after several days she returned for better arrangements.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	From this, therefore, I say that there is no fear in the incision of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	## On the Incision of the Gut Hernia
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This hernia, called the gut hernia, is a large aperture, according to the color of the body; and it is common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two modes: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly, in the natural, there is no skill.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	Accidental, indeed, it is according to two modes: of which one is similar to thick knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode is similar to an aperture that is made from the knot of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear in it, and it is not necessary for presumption to be made towards it with the iron, unless in what is barely sufficient; and you try it, and investigate it with the probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a thick knot, and it is not suspended with any vessels, then dry it as knots are dried; and extract it with what it contains from the cyst, if there is one; and if not, then scrutinize its whole self.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with what is necessary from treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	§ On the Section Regarding Knots' Species.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of nodules, and I have already described all their types in a division; and it is necessary that I tell the difference between a nodule and an exit here, as it creates doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	Therefore, I say that when the exitum (exit) presents heat, fever, and severe pain until the ebullition of excess fluid is calmed and putrefaction completes, then indeed the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When the nodule is not characterized by heat, fever, or pain and it contains a cystic sac that is its own bag and is according to the color of the body, then it is captured like a chick in an egg and becomes like a blister, with some larger and others smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two types: either plump or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a nodule, it is necessary that you experience it and examine it with the first instrument called Intromissum, according to its shape as it comes in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of examining the abscesses and nodules is to take this instrument and insert it into the moistest place that you find in the abscess; and you gradually push your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then, with your last hand, conform it according to the measure of the aperture's magnitude.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then extract the intromission and consider what emerges from its track.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore moisture emerges flowing, whatever its nature: then dry it by a shallow section, according to what I have said in the remaining apertures.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not emerge from the intromission's track, then know that it is fatty: so dry it by a section above it in the form of a cross, according to this form as I have taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and strip the skin from all sides easily: and guard the wound if you can over it, so that you extract the same healthy with the knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	However, if the cyst ruptures during the operation and it is not possible to extract it healthy, this often happens, then extract it fragmentarily until nothing remains from it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if something remains from it, whether little or much, the knot returns according to its greatest extent.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Which if it catches you, and something remains from it, even little: then fill the wound at your completion with some sharp, corroding powder: and tighten the wound, and place over it what sits on the aperture a hot compress, and care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If there is a large nodule, then its two lips and treatment of itself with what it encloses.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	However, if the vein is pulsating or not pulsating: then approach it and fill the space with a third-degree wound dressing, and leave it tightened for two days, or three, until the ulcer putrefies and the bleeding ceases; then return to incising what remains of the nodule.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	§ On external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Head XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From these are the forms of instruments for insertion, and there are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	Indeed, there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	They should be made of iron, square at both ends, so that they hold the opening in the wound firmly.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the shapes of instruments for piercing, and yes, they are called punctors, that is, piercing ones; and there are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	Indeed, there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They need to be probed and incised, and fistulas and buboes drained from what lies between them, which is bone.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round and smooth and soft, like a large needle that is used to sew, of citron or brass, or iron, or steel, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And experience is also made with black lead, which is used to probe fistulas, the cavities of which have reflections, so that they reflect with their gentle nature those same reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because they are long, medium, or short from them, according to the quantity of the width and tightness of the fistula.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shapes of stitches, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because they are simple, that is to say, having one thread: and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are blind stitches: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from these are hooks having two wounds, and they are of three kinds; and from these are hooks having three wounds, and they are also of three kinds; and all these are necessary in their respective places.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels by which knots and incisions are cut and made; and they are of three kinds, because there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	The ends by which the cutting is done are acute, and the other ends are not; and they are not used thus except to provide help in the incision of knots at the site of a vein or nerve's fear, or to cure the sick through them, and gain some rest from the heat as they did during the excoriation of an apostema.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the main ones, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of iron, and are similar to a knife with which alcohol is made; and at the tip there is a small hidden point of the scalpel, through which it flows inside and outside when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of the scalpels which are hidden among the fingers at the piercing of an apostema, and which are not perceived by the sick; and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of the wind instruments by which the flow of blood is divided; and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They should be made round and somewhat long from air or citron, as you see, and they should be thin.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And you should have these two kinds of wind instruments with you, the large and the small ones, so that you can drain blood quickly from them when necessary, and to use them when no other medicine is available.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them for the removal of blood from every part of the body, and only use them on fleshy parts, such as the thigh, hip, arm, breast, abdomen, groin, and similar places, where they are applied to damp flesh.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And when they are made into smaller instruments similar to the shape of almond shells, they can be used to drain blood when it flows from a phlebotomy site or near a vein or artery incision; and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	§ On the care of human mammary glands that resemble those of women.
Caput XLVII.	Head XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the mammary glands of certain men are inflated at the time of the addition of sleep (that is, when they begin to wet in their sleep) until they resemble the mammary glands of women: and they remain attached by suckling.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, if one avoids that, it is necessary to make a cut above the nipples with a lunar section, following this form from line b to line g. Then, peel away the entire puffy skin.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterward, fill the wound with an ointment made from incarnated medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then, join the two edges of the wound with stitching and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	However, if the nipple turns downwards and softens due to its own size, as happens with women, then it should be secured on both of its upper sides with two similar lunar-shaped cuts, where each is enclosed with the other at their ends, until a larger line encloses the smaller one, following this form from line b to line g. Then, peel away the skin between the two edges and remove the puffiness, and apply the stitching and ointments as mentioned earlier, which are necessary for healing, until it is cured.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not complete the incision that is necessary to be made because of the patient's restlessness or due to the flow of blood, then you should fill the wound with a submerged ointment that corrodes and leave it, until it corrodes what remains of the puffiness.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On the perforation of the apoplexy, which occurs under the titillition (nerve stimulation).
Caput XLVIII.	**Head XLVIII.**
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These apoplexies that occur under nerve stimulation are of the hard kind, resembling strains (tissues) that contain blisters, and some that contain moistures.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	As for those that are of the kind containing moistures, they should be incised with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b to g. When all that is in the apoplexy is thus drained out through the wound, then fill it up immediately with some healthy matter and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the dressing should be removed and the wound cared for with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the apoplexy is of the kind derived from hard strains (tissues), then cut it through as we have said regarding cutting the strains equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If however the wound extends to this point as to discharge pus, then apply a cauterization to it according to what has been said above.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	**On the section of the apoplexy that occurs due to an artery and vein.**
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX. Head.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery ruptures and the skin above it hardens, a deep ulcer often results from it; and the same happens to veins, leading to ulcers and swelling.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is recognized that the ulcer and swelling are due to an artery or vein are: since, when the ulcer is due to an artery, it is long, deep, and localized in the body; and when you press the ulcer with your fingers, you feel a kind of cracking sensation.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round, clearly visible on the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And cutting into the ulcer in this area is a mistake, especially when it is located under the armpits, groin, neck, and many other parts of the body; and it is a great risk.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to take care of it with caution when using a knife, and the same should be done for those at the extremities, or at the head.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, over that area where an artery's orifice becomes inflamed, make an incision in the skin along its length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, afterward locate the artery; and free it from the tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert under it a sharp knife, and cause it to penetrate until it reaches the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread at two places, as I taught you in extracting the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then punch the space between the two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood inside it has drained out and the hemorrhage is stopped.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off; afterwards, care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess due to the severing of a vein, then you must use your hand as much as possible to squeeze out the abscess along with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a knife under the place that you have held with your hand, and cause it to penetrate until you extract it from the other side. And put a double thread in it until you remove it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind the abscess tightly with a good ligament; as I told you about the young ligament, from both parts with both ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	However, if you find that the thread cannot be extracted, then insert another knife with a different thread under the entire abscess near the wound of the needle; press and tie your threads at four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Next, dry the abscess in the middle of it until the purulent matter is discharged; then cut away the excess skin and release what is tied up in it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Next, place on it the small piece of cloth that you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the treatment using poultices and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	§ On the abscess that occurs due to the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Head (L.)
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, so too does it occur in nerves; this happens either from a blow or from excessive strain, and similar conditions: and it is most common in the areas of assistance [i.e., the hands] or the foot, and at any location where there are joints, and it is severe.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	It resembles the colour of the rest of the body, and is present in many configurations without pain; and when it contracts with spasms, the patient feels a weakness similar to stupor.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And the abscess is not formed deeply within the body, but it is beneath the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not extend forward or backward, nor to the sides.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what arises from them at the joints should not be attacked with a sword.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps it happens that contraction occurs.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	However, for what arises from them in the head or forehead, find the skin with a scalpel.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is an apostema of the bones, then hold it with pincers and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape it; then remove it and dress the wound with sutures; and take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	§ On the cutting out of an apostema, which happens in the belly.
Caput LI.	Head (Chapter) LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Certain men suffer from repeated growths in their veins and other parts of their bodies, which are called Fungalia, due to their resemblance to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is thin and whose head is large, and their edges (or lips) are turned inward.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there are a few among them that are rare, and there are some that are very impressive.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have seen a man whose belly had two hernias, more similar to other things like fungi; there was no difference between them, white and thin roots, and their edges turned inwards, they closed up, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore, cut them and you will find that one weighs as much as one ounce and eight pennies, and the other as much as six pennies. And the operation is to make an incision in them, as you will consider then, if the patient is weak and moist, and the color is white and thin like a root: then cut it with a broad scalpel, and there will be cauterization before your eyes over fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled during the operation; therefore, if it should lacerate you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see that the patient is weak and timid from the operation with iron, then take a thread made well of lead and tie it around it: in this manner as I have said, and release it after two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the tightness of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Do not therefore cease to tighten the lead whenever it presses on the edges, until it is completely cut off and falls by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	However, if the root were very thick, then there would be something to fear and be afraid of in making its incision, especially when it comes to the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to make an incision through its middle.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it thoroughly so that it does not reopen.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not assume that you should make an incision into any part that is dark in color, has little sensation, and appears foul; for it is indeed a cancerous ulcer, and I will speak of this with remembrance of cancer thereafter.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	§ On the care of the hernia (umbilical).
Caput LII.	Chapter II.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The care of the hernia (umbilical) should be given due attention, as it arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from tears (ruptures) in the skin above the abdomen, through which it exits, be it fat, or intestine, according to what happens in other breaks.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood flowing from a vein, or artery, according to what has been mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	He was constrained by the urgency of the case.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	However, if it is due to a crack and the exit is clean, then the colour resembles that of the body's flesh: it is soft, without pain, and appears in a different place.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then its position is with the condition that we have described, of a greater diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	Therefore, when you press it with your fingers and it disappears, then later it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it, and it becomes very prominent at the bath entrance, causing great effort.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If indeed it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it does not disappear when you press it with your own hand, nor is there any constriction, nor is anything added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	Which if it is due to blood, then with these signs appears the abscess with blackening of the skin.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	However, if it is due to new flesh: then the abscess is grey, thick, hard, and fixed according to one part's quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If indeed it is due to heat, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that case is to consider, if there is a protuberance of the umbilical region due to blood from an artery or vein or circulation, then it is necessary to prevent treatment of that condition.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that case there is fear and trembling, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke of the apoptoes due to the artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the protuberance of the umbilical region is due to an intestine or gas, then it is necessary to urge the patient to retain their breath and stand stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then apply signs with hot wax around the entire umbilical area.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then instruct him to lie upside down between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then carefully with a broad spatula, circle around the umbilical area above the place where you previously marked it with hot wax.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the spreader of the apoptoes towards the upper parts with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie him tightly around the abdomen with a strong thread or a firm silk string; and let the knot of the ligament be loose.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess that is extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find the same now captured by the ligament: then extract the tongue, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen; and if you find the liver, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If, however, it is against you an artery or vein: then surround it with much care.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then prepare for your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert in them two strong threads: and insert two needles around the circumference that you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the abscess at four places above the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the flesh becomes putrid: and it will fall by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and putrid.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the necessary ointments until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If there is an protrusion from the flesh of the navel, either from bone or moisture: then it is necessary to make a hollow abscess as we said before.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract blood, or moisture, as you find it within.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for the wound itself to solidify the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	§ On the care of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Head (Part) III.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have described the division of the kinds of cancer and how the way to its cure is with medicines: and the need to be wary from it in healing, so as not to ulcerate; and we have described cancer generated in the matrix, and the precaution in its healing.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it completely, such as cancer that is in the breasts or thigh, and those similar ones, from the parts located to be extracted all of it; especially when it is beginning in a small way.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When it is truly ancient and great, one should not approach it too closely.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I have not been able to heal anyone from it; nor have I seen another before me who has succeeded in that regard.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when located as we have described, is to precede, and thus relieve the patient from the black cholera several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then, if you find the phlebotomy itself obvious with a manifest fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he is spoken of when performing the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then insert into the cancer hooks that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then make an incision into it from every part with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and allow the blood to flow, do not cut it off quickly, but express the wound thoroughly by hand, or with instruments as possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, the flow of thick blood from an artery or vein causes you trouble; then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the rest of the cure until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	**Of the cure for hydrops.**
Caput LIIII.	Head (IV)
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have discussed in detail the division of hydrops and how the accumulation of water occurs; as well as the signs of each type and its cure with medications.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those that are treated with iron are nothing but the sole species of ascletis, and they do not approach the species of tympanitis with iron; nor do they penetrate completely to the species of hyposarcae, for that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When, after having treated this species of tympanitis with medicines, the treatment does not improve it, then consider this:
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the weakness has already taken hold, or there is another illness with it apart from hydropisis, such as cough, dissolution of the chest, and others like them, then be wary not to treat it with iron, for that is a danger.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a patient with abundant strength and no illness other than hydropisis alone, neither young nor old, then the mode of operation is that you raise the patient standing in your hands, and have the assistant afterwards press his belly with his hand, driving water down to the lower parts of the ribs.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a spatule with a sharp edge, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It has two sharp points, long, with a sharp end like a spatule.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, it should have some degree of thickness gradually, so that it does not penetrate with you during the operation up to the intestine and injure it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	If there is a swelling due to fluid accumulation in part of the intestines, then it is necessary to lengthen with a cut from the navel with the quantity of three fingers, towards the lower parts in a straight line above the breastbone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If the swelling is indeed due to liver disease: then your cut should be from the navel with three fingers on the left side.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the swelling is due to the spleen, then the cut should be on the right side: and it is not necessary for the cut to also be on the left side where the patient wants to lie, so as not to cause excess fluid to flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the skin with an instrument throughout its whole thickness.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that cut, and lift your hand with the scalpel between the skin, and make an incision, as if you were pricking it yourself: and the amount to be cut off should be about the size of a fingernail, or somewhat less.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then make an incision through the scar, until the scalpel reaches the empty space: and that is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then remove the scar tissue, and insert an instrument into the opening, which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to the cannula: it is made of silver, or copper, or brass, smooth: it has a small opening at its lower part, and on its sides there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other; and its end is cut, according to the manner of cutting the calamus, as you will see: at the top of its end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, thus drawing the quantity of water equal to that of the hour at once.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you draw too much water from it, perhaps the patient dies in that hour through the resolution of his animal spirit; or he suffers a fainting spell that brings him close to death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Indeed, the drawing of water from it is according to its strength, and according to what the weaknesses of the patient tell you, from the pulse of his strength and from his goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it is retained immediately due to the skin which retains the opening that is above the sieve, about which I spoke, so that you pierce it according to that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the process with the instrument on the second day, if you see that the patient can endure it; and also extract a small quantity of water from it.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	During those days, perform that operation without fear and guard yourself against error; until there remains no water except a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	However, if you are dealing with a weak patient and have removed a significant amount of water, then take care of the patient with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and under the sun, and watch for thirst; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed; and cauterize over the stomach, and epilate, and treat the spleen after extraction of the water, according to what I have described above.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	§ On the care of infants who are born in places where their urinary passages are not pierced.
Caput LV.	Head 50.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When an infant emerges from its mother's womb, and its head is not pierced, or the opening is narrow, or it is located not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, it is necessary to help with the piercing immediately after birth with a fine forceps, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then insert a fine wire through the opening, and tie it; hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When it is able to pass urine, remove the wire, and let it expel.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce the swelling.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not apply lead (plaster), it is possible that the urine flowing over the place will prevent it from closing.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose opening (wound) is narrow should be treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it widens.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the opening (wound) is not in its proper place, they are damaged.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	This is because the opening (wound) is near the end of the handle of the weapon; therefore, it cannot be cleaned towards the front until it raises the weapon with its own hand to higher parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	It is not born in him, because the sperm cannot reach the matrix (uterus) straight; and it is a severe illness indeed.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the mode of operation in that case is for the patient to lie on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the weapon's handle with your left hand, stretching it greatly, and cut the head of the weapon from its previous place with a sharp point or a sharp spatula; as if it is cutting a calamus or like carving something, so that a new opening appears in the middle as it should be.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And be sure to prevent blood flow near your surgical site.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens indeed.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, oppose it with what causes the bleeding to stop and treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	§ Concerning Albater's accounts of events occurring in the prepuce and scalp, corruption, blackening, and adhesions.
Caput LVI.	Head (LVI)
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These kinds of things often happen in surgery, and there is great danger to the flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from these, some are evil, and others not.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a delicate hook and cut it off until it is completely removed.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place over it a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat the same place after that with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the ulcer is malignant with a discolored wound, then after making an incision and its drainage, it is necessary to apply a caustic agent to it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	However, if the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and it is part of the foreskin, as well as a part of it outside: then you should remove the ulcer that is inside first, until it heals, and then take care of the outer part: because when you treat it at the same time, the foreskin will not be secure but perforation will occur.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And also it happens in the testicles, and there is blackening and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you should take care to remove everything that has already been discolored and also wants to rot or is already rotten.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply a line over it after that with honey and flour from crushed nuts and herbs from the grinder.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	However, if there is bleeding, then apply a caustic agent with a lunar cautery in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	A caustic agent is indeed useful for two dispositions at the same time, that is, for bleeding and a wound when it rots.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the whip corrodes and destroys it entirely in an instant, then you should insert a small leaden tube into the meatus first so that the weak one can urinate over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the true adherence of the prepuce to the head of the whip, and this adhesion does not occur except in one whose prepuce is healthy, and no circumcision is required over it; and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound or ulcer: therefore, it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt scalpel until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the whip is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish these precisely, then you should scrape off a little from the head of the whip and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because when the prepuce is thin, it may be easily perforated because of its own thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate them using a thin linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with astringent wine until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	§ On the purification of infants and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a cure for continuity, as with other wounds; however, when it is performed by our own hand, according to our own will, and its use is appropriate for boys from an early age, it is necessary that we perform the operation in a better and more gentle way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they do not observe it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Which is because I find a greater part of the art, and the use of purification by cutting with a sharp instrument, and with shears; they use cauterization, and binding with string, and incision with a claw.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tried all these methods, and I do not find a better purification than with shears and binding with string.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in purification with a sharp instrument, the skin often flees.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the prepuce has two layers; therefore, perhaps the upper skin is incised and tears the lower layer; so it forces a cut to be made in order to incise the other one, and future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when purification is done by amputation, that is, the digit used by surgeons, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured, because perhaps it enters his wound.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	However, in the case of amputation with a fingernail, the iron may be bent and ruin your operation, and the skin of a boy is naturally thin, and many are born in such a way that they do not require purification. And you will already have seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	Amputation with scissors and tying with thread has shown me a good experiment: because the scissors are proportionate to the cut, so that the sharpness above is like the sharpness below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you place your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportionate and they cut according to one operation at the same time, and compression is made in a similar manner, containing the skin of the weapon from every side, so that no error occurs at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the mode of operation is such that you can estimate, especially a boy, if he understands a little bit what you are doing, unless you only tie the thread to his weapon and let it go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him enjoy and be happy in every possible way from what he receives understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not sit down; keep the hidden scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his armpit, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the weapon emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse that part of it from the filth it has accumulated.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then bind the lower part with a thin strip of ligature according to need.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold it with your index finger and thumb, ensuring good purchase of the lower ligament, and cut between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then quickly lift the skin upwards and extract the head of the weapon.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros. Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then allow the blood to flow slowly (it is better this way), and apply a poultice above; and over the poultice place a cloth in which the prepared ointment has been spread, mixed with rosewater and oil. Lastly, apply it well and leave it over the wound until the next day; then tend to the rest of the wound until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the scalpel for purification is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	It has two sharp points and they are curved; the claw's branch should not protrude from them; the length of both cutting edges should be equal to the length of both handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	A common error in purification is that perhaps the entire inner skin or a part of it escapes from the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, from the beginning, you must stretch it with your finger before marking the place and cut it equally.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your finger, then extract it with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If they exceed three days, and there remains something under the hook, marked and swollen, then leave it until the mark is warm and easily remove the scabs, cutting it according to what you have prepared, and be careful from the handle of the hook.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore, take care of it so that it consolidates the wound from the impurities we mentioned in the treatise on impurities; and if it is cut through the skin beyond the required depth and widens towards the upper parts, it will not harm him even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it as we have said until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	**On the Extraction of Retained Urine in the Bladder**
Caput LVIII.	**Head LVIII.**
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by congestion from stone, congealed blood, pus, flesh, or similar conditions arising from the modes of treatment we have described in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the bladder is not relieved and you see that the retention is due to a stone that is in the neck of the bladder, then he should be laid on his knees for treatment.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet should be placed on his back, and he should stretch his breath from the upper part of his back, and tighten his weak breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, it is squeezed with the neck of the bladder towards the rear to expel the stone, which releases the bladder.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not relieved as we have said and the condition of the patient is grave, then he should undergo extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: made of silver, thin, flexible, similar to the reed of a bird's feather in fineness, long like the palm of one hand, with a thin tube at its tip.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of exiting a wound through it is to take a doubled thread and bind it at its end with wool or cloth, a good ligature; and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut away any surplus wool with scissors, and insert it into the tube with care.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then, moisten the syringe with oil or butter and alum: and place the patient sitting up, and insert the needle, and the same virga (catheter) with moist oils, olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the virga (catheter) easily until it reaches the root of the virga.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double that part at the upper side of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe inside until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has already reached the empty place; and this is not done in this order unless the passage through which it flows is one in which there is a bend.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	The wound will indeed follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then extract it and make the wound flow through the urethra; and repeat the syringe, and do not stop doing this until the vesica is empty and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of enema with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Head IX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a ulcer occurs in the urethra, or blood is congealed within it, or pus is contracted within it, and water and medicines need to be distilled into it; then it should be done with an instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is indeed closed, that is, obstructed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And it has three openings, two from one side and one from the other, as you can see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the concave place, where it is pressed, should be according to the amount that fills it without addition, until something is drawn through it from moisture; and when it is pressed, it is expelled with it to a great distance: according to what the clepsydra does, which projects naphtha, that is, Greek fire in martial conflicts.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When water is therefore projected into the urethra, insert the end of the clepsydra into the moisture and draw with it what presses towards the upper parts, for moisture is drawn into the concave part of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert the end of it into the penis, as we told in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then he drives away the moisture with what drives it, for the moisture reaches the wound immediately, so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a delicate enema by which the wound is enemaized.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or brass: the head should be higher like a small bowl, and under it there should be a cavity into which the ligature falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the wound of an animal, and put into it the moisture with which you are to enemaize the wound.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then bind it between two cavities with a strong ligature of double thread, and warm that moisture slightly over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the enema into the wound, afterwards tighten your hand over the wound with the moisture in a proper manner, until the patient feels that that moisture has now reached the wound.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If, however, the wound is not present to you, then take a fragment of parchment, and make from it a circle, and perforate it itself free of all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread into those openings as they unravel.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then add the circle, as you would with a bandage: after you place in it what you wish to remove from moistures, oils, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie the band tightly with an instrument; and do with it as you did with the other band from the expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the wound.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	§ On the extraction of stones.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have described the division of stone species and their treatment with medicines; I have explained the difference between stones formed in the kidneys, bladders, and signs thereof; I have spoken of the stone in which the operation takes place with the hand and the incision; and it is a stone that forms naturally in the bladder; and I am narrating this with clear exposition and abridgment.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I therefore say that stones formed in the bladder most often occur in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And one of its signs is that the urine comes out of the bladder similar to water in its fineness; and white sand appears in it, and the weak man rubs his penis, and he labors with it, and often hangs from it.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it (the stone) becomes raised, and the anus opens with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the healing of children is easy until they reach fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in young people it is medium, since it lies between these two: and the treatment is easier for him whose stone is larger; and if it is small, then the effort of treatment is lessened.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When we come to treatment, it is therefore necessary first to cleanse the patient with enemas, to extract all filth that is in his intestines; for this itself sometimes prevents the stone from passing near the urinary tract during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the patient should be taken with his feet up, and shaken and moved towards the lower parts: so that the stone descends to the depths of the bladder, or sometimes jumps out from its high position.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands, and let his hands be under his hips, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and feel him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the stone in the space, then immediately approach with a knife to cut over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall entirely under your touch, then you should clean the index finger with oil from your left hand if the patient is a young boy; or the middle finger if he is a fully grown youth; and insert it into his anus, while gently exploring from the stone, until it remains steady beneath your finger. Then gradually bend it towards the base of the penis.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press it with your finger and push it towards the outside opposite to the location, whose section you have made; and specifically instruct the assistant to press the vein with his hand, and direct another assistant to stretch the testicles with his right hand upwards; and with his other hand, remove the skin that is beneath the testicles in the area where the section is located.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the speculum, which has this form.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find what is between the anus and testicles, not in the middle, towards the left side of birth; and let the section be above the stone, and your finger inside the anus; and make the cut transversal so that the outer section is wide, and inner tight, according to how much it is possible for the stone to exit without being larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps indeed the finger that is inside the anus, near the stone at the time of the section, will press it and allow it to exit without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that from a stone that has angles and edges, its difficult to exit due to them.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it is derived a soft, gland-like, and round shape, which facilitates its exit.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, those that have angles and edges, add them to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not exit thus, then it is necessary that someone skilled perform an operation on it: either tie it with a thread over it with careful movements, whose end is like the Moon, which ties over the stone and does not slip from it; or insert under it a fine instrument with carefully guarded ends.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If, however, you cannot perform the above, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something catches you with blood, cut it off with a knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If indeed the stone is more than one, then push the largest first towards the opening of the urethra.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then make an incision over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards, push the smaller ones after that one; and do similarly if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is very large, then ignorance is as if cutting over it with a great section.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Since it happens that a patient suffers from one of two conditions, either he dies or he experiences continuous urine discharge, as a result of which the affected area does not heal at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	Indeed, administration of expulsion should continue until it is gone: or use instruments in the fracture with forks, until you extract it bit by bit.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with turpentine, aloe, and dragon's blood: tighten it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then turn the patient face-up on their collarbone, and do not loosen the ligature until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosened it, then apply water and a lot of oil to the affected area.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound with the ointment of dyafinic and basilic until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If, however, a hot and infected abscess forms in the wound, along with corrosion and similar conditions: as if blood clots in the veins and urine is prevented from exiting; and it is recognized by the discharge of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore, insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood from it.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it causes the vein to corrupt and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then, clean the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply to all kinds of it what is appropriate from treatment until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary, during the whole course of treatment, that two bands be placed around the thighs and legs, due to the medicines applied over the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If a stone is small and lies in the urethra, and it is fixed in it, and blocks the flow of urine, then treatment should be done with what I mentioned before you reach the cutting stage.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Indeed, many times I have avoided dissection through this treatment, for I have already tested it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, as you take a perforator of iron, whose form this is, with two pointed ends, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie the rod beneath the stone so that it does not return to the vein.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into the limb with ease, until it reaches the perforator itself against that stone; and then turn the perforator with your hand on the same stone little by little; and protect the perforation of it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	It is immediately emptied (or drained).
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand over what remains of the stone from the outer part of the limb.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It (the stone) will then break and pass out with the urine, and the patient is cured of his ailment.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If, however, this treatment does not prepare for you because of something that prevents it from happening, then tie a thread under the stone and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry the stone on the same limb between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it (the stone).
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then untie the binding, and clean the congealed blood that has formed in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone unless it does not return to the wound; and another binding above the stone, unless when the thread is untied after the stone has passed, the skin returns to its place, and closes the wound: and for that reason, you must do this when you tie the upper thread, so as to lift the skin towards the higher parts, so that it returns to your completion, and closes the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the extraction of the female stone.
Caput LXI.	Head 51.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	The stone is rarely found in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	However, if the stone should occur in any of them, then treatment is difficult and prohibited due to its many modes.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that the woman might be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is that you will not find a woman who reveals herself to a doctor when she is chaste or has a husband.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is that you will not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially the manual operation of it.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: for it needs a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	Which if necessity demands, then you must take a woman doctor, well-versed, and she is rarely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If indeed you desire this, then seek a chaste doctor, subtle, and a present woman obstetrician well-versed in women's affairs, or a woman who has herself learned parts of this art; so do make her present, and to her, especially command her to do all that you inquire of her regarding the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, one must check if a woman is a virgin: then it is necessary to insert a finger into her vagina and feel for a stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If she feels a hard object, he should press it with his finger and then immediately call upon the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina and feel for the stone. After placing her left hand over the opening, she should apply gentle pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If she finds the stone, then it is necessary to move it gradually from the vaginal opening towards the lower parts with all her strength until she reaches it as far as the root of her hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should cut it off at the level of the middle of the thigh near the root of the hip, from whatever side it is positioned. She should feel for the stone in that area, and her finger should not be removed from under it; the initial cut should be small.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then she should insert the knife blade over that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If she feels the stone, then she should continue cutting according to the amount that the stone emerges from her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From it is a small and great one, soft and rough, long and round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore, know the nature of it, as it will show you concerning that which you see.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood catches you, then add to the place three layers of bandage, and hold it tightly for an hour until the blood stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then prepare for your operation until the stone is expelled, and make sure to have with you, among the instruments I mentioned for extracting stones from men, those that will assist you in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If blood flow catches you, and you know that expelling the blood is from an artery that has been cut, then put powder on the place, and tighten it with little bands properly; and do not stop it tightly, and let the stone go, without extracting it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When the sharpness of the blood subsides after days and the place putrefies, then prepare for your operation until the stone is expelled.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	On cutting through a water-filled hernia.
Caput LXII.	**Chapter LXII**
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A water-filled hernia occurs only when there is an accumulation of moisture in a sac located beneath the skin containing the testicle or its appendages, and it is called the "sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is contained within a sac that nature has prepared for itself in a part of the body, until it can be discharged, which is another fluid and is located between the skin of the testicle and the white sifac, as we have said, and it does not occur except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	The cause of this condition is the weakness that occurs in the testicles, which allows this material to be discharged towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And it can also occur due to impact or striking the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or it may have a decline towards greenish, or reddish-blue, or foul-smelling black, or clear white, and these are the most common conditions.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the accumulation of water is located, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if there is any defect in the operation as we have said, then the abscess is round and has a length somewhat like that of the figure: and the testicle does not appear, since moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in the skin itself, then the abscess is round with a portion of it, and because of this, a person thinks that it is another testicle.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white part of the operation, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When therefore one has the knowledge of the colour of moisture, then examine the colour of moisture in the abscess with a square inserted, whose shape precedes it.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, according to what is revealed in the insertion, judge of that which is between them.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the cure with a blade, then it is necessary that you urge the patient, if possible for him, to have blood let, and see the state of his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he should be turned over on his back slightly elevated, and many cloths should be placed under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left side, and strictly order the assistant to sit on his right side, who shall stretch out his patient's arm to one of the two sides of his testicle skin, and to the part of his heart.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad scalpel and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along the length, almost reaching the breastbone. Let the incision be made according to the straight line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white head enclosing it: and examine and observe it, or carefully cut it yourself, so as to cut through the part that hangs down with the egg more easily. Then delicately explore the wound according to your ability.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then make a wide perforation through the white head with a sharp instrument, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the white head towards the upper parts, without touching the skin enclosing the testicles: and cut into the white head as best you can, either through its entire length or in part, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine the wound, there is no security that water will not return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	However, if the egg proceeds outward from its skin during your surgical procedure: then when you have completed the incision of the white head, bring it back inside.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it like the rest of the wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a wound corrupted from blackness by some other cause, then it is necessary to use the instruments that are ligatures, being afraid of the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with its suspension, and extract the wound; afterwards take care of it as we said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water is aggregated in two parts, then know that there are two branches; so dry the other part equally as you did with the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it agrees with you, so that it becomes one operation, then do this; afterward blot up the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce the thread into the sections of the lap covered with oil or rosy oil; and place from outside another thread than you immersed in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles, and open the belly; and place two doubled cloths above, and they should be small; and bind them above with a ligature that has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, and sweat them, and fill them with red dye according to this likeness; and let the ends by which it is pressed be of cloth or wet wool; and join them with the tightening around the waist; and one end should take hold on the rear as far as the back, and the second should take hold on the part of the chest; and two other ends should be placed above both thighs below, and two other ends should be placed above both inguinal regions, and all the tightening should be joined around the waist.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes, this part is surgically treated with a hot iron in the place of the cut, and it is as if you take a sharp scalpel and cut the skin of the testicles along with it; and it is inflamed, as we have mentioned. Until when it uncovers a white, healing cloth containing water, then take the cauterizer in this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It assimilates with Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with that healing cloth, and it is inflamed until all humidity is expelled.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the healing cloth with hooks, and scrape it with a thin, ignited cauterizer, and cut into it as much as possible for you until you eradicate all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And cauterize from there, so that it does not touch the original fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is more salutary, and causes less blood flow, and is better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, it causes you opposition in the hour of cutting, or in the hour of cauterization a hot apostema, or blood flow, or something else: then you must care for what opposes you from that with the healing that is suitable to it, as has been mentioned above.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect this operation because of its terrifying nature, then administer the perforation as I describe that it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you have certified to yourself, through that which we said about the meaning of "ramex" (which is watery), then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the fistula in the lower part of his body with a broad spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place over the site a clean dressing, bind it, and let it flow out the remaining water; then care for it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is opposition to the flow of water at the time when you pierce it, and this is not otherwise due to a white pannicle causing opposition in the wound opening and preventing the exit of water, then you must introduce a needle into the wound or an instrument with which the hydropic water is extracted, whose form has already been described; or add to the operation on the wound slightly.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns, and it is collected after six months, or about those times.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it is collected, then it will return in the same manner, and the patient will pass his days as before.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the care of flesh wounds.
Caput LXIII.	**Chapter LXIII**
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in this section about flesh wounds, there are many arrangements leading to fear and even harm.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me that the removal of these is a beneficial cure from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am mindful of the operation on them, and the appearance of the scar.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many scars occur in the bodies, from which the testes are formed: and this happens for many reasons, namely...
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from the excessive or acute discharge that flows towards the testes.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from striking.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the appearance of the scar is according to the color of the body, and it does not cause pain; and the scar is gray.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps the scar is a hard one, whose color is dark brown, and it has no sensation.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it arises from the constriction of arteries and their swelling, as has been mentioned before; or from the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	What is therefore due to their swelling of arteries can be known by the condition of the pulsating mass when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary for you to touch it directly at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	But what happens due to the swelling of veins does not disappear from it when you press with your fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible that an incision can be made over this type of mass, and also over the other flesh; and it is as if you were to cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the flap upwards and extract it with a clean knife; and free the suspenders from the cavity, and tie the vessels; and cut the suspenders after you have freed them from every part of the tissue.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the flap has become consolidated with those native tissues, then you must grasp the flap and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between any of the flaps or within what is between the vessels, then you must free all that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If, however, the origin of the flesh is in a place of adhesion which is at the back, then it is necessary to cut through all of it and extract the humour, as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When, therefore, your work is completed, then fill the wound with the infused lint in rose oil and wine; then take care of it just as you do with the rest of the healing process, until it is cured.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	**On the Care of Ramics, which is with Vine.**
Caput LXIIII.	**Head 149.**
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	It is a condition known as apoplexy, which is a kind of disruption similar to a stroke, affecting the testicles and making it difficult for the patient to move or exercise, or even walk.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness, fear is involved, due to that which preceded it as a reminder.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	Indeed, we must say that the operation on it should be according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore that it is necessary for you to make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the suspender of the testicles down.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, close to the scrotum, and have another assistant pull it taut.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a sharp, flat knife across the muscles in a straight line, until the muscles are detected.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then clean it from all parts, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries in the temporal regions.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fasten it with a sharp knife where the double thread is located, and tie it itself at the first places where accidents occur; then tie it again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut it in the middle with a sharp knife along a straight line according to the length of the body, and extract what is aggregated from corrupt, foul humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the care given to the other wounds, where pus is generated, so that the muscles that nourish one testicle will fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not harmful through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	However, if all the muscles become affected, then they should be extracted for this reason, so as not to be deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and it becomes weakened or withers and is not healthy with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	On the care of intestinal ramified (or branched) structures.
Caput LXV.	Head XV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The course of these ramified structures (or branches) is from a cut that occurs in the perineum over the urethra in the inguinal region near the entrails.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from a simple cut or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis. Aut ex percussione. Aut saltu. Aut clamore. Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur for many reasons. Or from impact. Or through a jerk (or sudden movement). Or from noise (or commotion). Or from the elevation of a serious condition, and similar factors.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from the extension of a cut.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long period of time, and not suddenly; and the hernia is equal towards the deep side: for it compresses the intestines.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of its occurrence when it is from the section of the hernia, because it causes a sudden intense pain from the beginning; and the hernia is diverse, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is due to the exit of the intestine and its course towards the exterior of the hernia.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it emerges with the intestine, it is called the intestinal hernia, and the hernia; and sometimes it occurs with violence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes feces run into the intestine and get stuck there, causing severe weakness; it causes intense pain, especially when pressed upon.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these diseases, there is fear of complications; therefore, one must be cautious about such cases.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is to urge the patient gently to reduce the intestine by hand back into its proper position if he follows instructions.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it should be raised above its collarbone between your hands, and support his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin upwards, and dry the skin of the testes completely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Next, fix two hooks of the section in the jaws, according as you need them to open the section with these: and the section should be according to the quantity that it is possible for it to emerge from.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Next, scrape the skin, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until the white siphon is detected, hard from all sides: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white siphon, which is under the skin yes, and between the second siphon, and absolutely adhere to it with the adhesion which is in the posterior part yes.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Next, move with the right hand to the inner skin of the testicles: and with this, extend the white siphon upwards with the left hand: and lift the siphon towards the part of the section: and instruct the helper to extend the egg upward: and you dissolve the adhesion, which is behind by complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And ask your fingers not to be anything there from the internal untwisted into the white hard siphon.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If, however, you find anything from it: then push it towards the middle below.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Next, take the thread, in which there is a thick filament, made licentious from ten threads: and insert it near the last siphon, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles following the section: then cut the ends which emerge from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then he should compose some of them over others with a figure in the manner of a cross, and tie them with the same ligature as we mentioned, since it is firmly attached beneath the skin to the ligament of the testicles, until he can cause some of the substances that nourish them to be released towards them, so that nothing hot comes from there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another ligature again according to the outer ligature, distant from it less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, release from the ligature, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, a quantity equal to the size of a finger, and cut off the remainder entirely according to its roundness, and remove it from there.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then, cut, in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, a section from which the blood flows and pus is discharged, as we mentioned in what has been said above.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply a bandage dipped in oil to the wound, and place it as we mentioned. And apply the ligature that we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the white ligature that we mentioned has been cauterized, after the incision of it, fearing the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens indeed.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And release the ligature until it falls of itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, the case is delayed, then it is bathed with hot water; and place on top of it what we have said, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the rest of the wound treatment until it is cured.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	§ Of the Abundant Blood Vessel.
Caput LXVI.	Head XVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this abundant vessel, one does not see anyone who dares to surpass its curative power with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And indeed, they first said that it is done as we have narrated in the vessel which is with the vein.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Which is, as you bind the vessels after cutting them with ease below; then dry in the middle, and treat afterward with what opens it, until the vessels fall; and care for the wound according to what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	§ On the Disruption Which Occurs in the Groin.
Caput LXVII.	Head XVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the opening protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends below the scrotum; and if it does descend, it is but slight, and returns in all hours; but if it prolongs itself with this condition for some time, a fissure is added to the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And it happened that this issue arises from the extension of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	For it extends the scrotum: then it becomes soft, and the space moves aside, and it protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And the treatment of it is with cauterization, as its preceding description has narrated.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with iron, in this manner: and he lies down on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the place of the rupture that has moved aside and protrudes, by cutting along its width, according to the thickness of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tie the scrotum and, what lies under the skin, until it detaches the white scrotum that lies beneath the skin which follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the radium and place it on top of the protruding place from the scrotum, and press it deep into the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then press upon the two protruding places at the ends of the radium from the scrotum, and sew one to the other; then extract the end of the radium.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And you should not make any incision with a knife at all, nor stretch or pull, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then turn your attention to the care of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When, therefore, you make an incision with a knife, cleanse it, and heal the wound until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	Indeed, it contracts and does not add to the prominence of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cauterization is better at this site, for it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	§ On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Head LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	In some men, the skin of the testicles often softens because the flesh surrounding them becomes softened, and the appearance of it is disfigured.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore, he who is charged with his care must make the patient lie on his back and cut all the softened skin that has become detached from the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then, aggregate the two lips with a suture. If necessary, use three or four sutures to soften the skin's excess and form a firm suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then, make an incision between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then, take care of the healing of the remaining wounds until they are healed and the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	**On castration.**
Caput LXIX.	Head LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated by our law, and for that reason it is permissible for me not to mention it in this book of mine, and its remembrance is not necessary except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it should be known by the doctor when asked about it, and that he should know its cure for whoever happens to have it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And another reason is that we often need to perform castration on certain animals for our purposes, such as rams, wild boars, cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	By friction.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by cracking and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In cases where friction is used, the method of operation is as follows: We make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles become soft and relaxed and hang down; then we apply pressure with our hand until they break free and no longer appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by cracking and cutting, you must hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligaments and dry the entire cut with a cloth, until two eggs have been laid; then, after you have cleaned them, make an incision in each one and do not leave anything remaining from the shell except a thin layer that is on the surface.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that by friction, because friction may leave some remaining part of the testicles, which makes the animal desire copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then tend to the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	§ On caring for hermaphrodites using both methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	An hermaphrodite is found in men in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One type is because it appears to have a space following it, or on the skin of the testicles, where there is a figure resembling a woman's vulva, with hair, and sometimes urine flows from that part on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	But in women there is one kind, which resembles a woman's vulva over the breast as if it were the pair of testicles in men, protruding towards the outside; of these, one is like the penis of a man, and two are like the two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment for these three types, two of men and one of women, is as follows: because it is necessary to cut into the added flesh until the impression of them escapes.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then, treat them with the same care as other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	However, in the second type of men, from which urine exits on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation and indeed no treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	§ On the cutting of the tentigine and the protruding flesh on women's vulvas.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The tumor may be added to the natural one until it becomes inflamed and takes on an unsightly appearance, and in some women, it is so magnified that it expands like that of a man, reaching up to sexual intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, it is necessary that you hold the excess of the tumor with your hand or a hook and cut it, but not too close to the end, especially deep into the root, so as not to cause bleeding.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound itself until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But when a tumor grows in the mother's womb, it fills itself until it reaches its full size, and sometimes it emerges to the outside like a tail, and for that reason some people call this disease "caudate" (tail-like).
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, we must cut it like we cut the tumor, and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	§ On the care of the Alratic (a rare condition in women not pierced).
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratic is when there is an abnormal growth in a woman that is not pierced or has only a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	It is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from a condition that precedes illness; it arises either from born flesh added, or by subtile and thin, or thick discharge, and occurs in the depths of the matrix, or on its sides, or on the upper or lower part of itself, and hinders coitus, impregnation, delivery, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	Its recognition is done through the examination of obstetrics if pregnancy is evident and close at hand.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	However, if it's not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or using a cane.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	However, if the pregnancy is from a thin and subtle discharge and is close to two lips: then approach it and break it open.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, as you place two little threads on the lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your two hands together and have the woman lie on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then stretch the two lips with force until the thin discharge is broken and the pregnancy opens.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a cloth, immerse it in oil, and place it on the spot; have the woman press it every day so that the place does not harden again.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the tumour is large and thick, then it should be cut out with a broad, similar spatula like a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the swelling is from flesh that has formed, then suspend it with hooks and cut it; and have with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without laceration, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and turpentine mixed with alum.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Next, insert a large lead pipe into the wound so that it does not heal quickly; hold it for several days. Then apply linseed oil, and afterwards continue with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when any new growths of flesh are born, then they should be cut according to this manner; for as long as there is no cancerous ulcer, which is the cancerous growth within the matrix, let there be no opposition with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	**On the care of haemorrhoids, Atehelil, and bothor (rubella) in women's bodies.**
Caput LXXIII.	Head LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Haemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the veins, as long as much blood runs out of them persistently.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	Since hemorrhoids have existed from ancient times, they are categorized into types and each has its own signs; I will discuss here which ones receive treatment and which ones do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say, therefore, that hemorrhoids which are inside the anus and do not appear to the senses: then there is no treatment for them with a knife.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those that are among them, on which the sense falls, are the ones that receive treatment.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary that a woman should enter a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then she extends the hemorrhoids with forceps or with a rough cloth and cuts them off from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then she cleans them near the flow of blood from one of the incisions without wounding: like myrrh, and dragon's blood, and pitch, and similar substances.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then she pushes her feet against the wall at the same time.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	After that, she lays her down in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and sweet almond peel, and gall, and similar substances.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take flour of barley and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If blood comes out with it, that is good; and if not, make the plaster adhere to the back and the breasts without incision.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and dip it in tar or sea-snail juice or grapevine juice, that is, in silver vitriol, wine, and make it adhere to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the ulcer has healed, then take care of the place with ointments until it is cured.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albucasis indeed describes the red bark as similar to the heads of almonds, and it has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut what appears from it, as I said before, equally, and take care of itself until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	§ On the perforation of the matrix (ovary) which occurs.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of ulcers occur in the matrix, such as cancer, stone ulcers, sores, abscesses, erysipelas, fistulas, hemorrhoids, cracks, and hot ulcers.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed already spoken of all these diseases and the forms of them, and their signs, and their cures by division: it is necessary that I should speak in this treatise of the hot fistula that occurs in the matrix, when there are fistulas that gather up the blood, and to know how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary that you should consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the fistula is sharp in its beginning and accompanied by its inflammation and fever, and you see it turn red, and if the sensation passes over it, then you do not progress with its perforation; and treat it as it becomes better above the stage of maturation until such time as the acuteness of the accidents ceases.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then you must make the woman sit on a seat that supports two cushions, and recline or lie down on her back, and bring her feet up to the lower part of her belly: and let her hips be spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, and bind them with the appropriate binding.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the woman's right side, and use the instrument to open the orifice of the matrix.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Which form comes into those that follow.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And when you wish to use this instrument, you must insert it into the deep part of the woman's matrix; so that what enters from the instrument does not exceed the depth of the matrix, and does not harm the sick person.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If the instrument is too long, then it is necessary to place small pieces on top of the cover of the deep matrix, in order to prevent the entire instrument from entering into the depth of the matrix; and it is necessary to place a guard, which runs along the side of the upper instrument, and to hold the instrument, and for the attendant to release the guard until the depth of the matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When the exit becomes apparent and is touched by the hand, and it is soft and flexible, then it is necessary to cut it off at its own head with a wide blade.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the discharge is complete, then it is necessary to place on the wound a compress soaked in rose-colored oil or green oil, which has some astringent properties; and after placing the compress, extract the section into the depth of the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally on the matrix, and over the comb, clean wool soaked in water with crushed stones.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then, after two days, it should be treated with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the matrix and wound are completely healed, then it should be washed with water and honey; afterwards, with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled, and finally return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary to prevent treatment with iron, and instead, take care of it as we said in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	On Obstetrics: How embryos that have taken an unnatural form during their exit from the womb should be treated.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXX: The Head
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is essential for an obstetrician to know the natural form of labor.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, from these signs, when you see a woman bending towards the lower parts and she desires fresh air, and relief is felt above her where the child is located, and it seems that the exit of the embryo is imminent; then know that this labor is according to a natural form, and the child emerges on its own head, and the second stage follows with it: either suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you observe these signs, then it is necessary to press her belly so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends onto its own head, the second stage follows with it, and it is cleansed of those superfluities with a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	However, if labor deviates from this form, it is unnatural and should be avoided.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the fetus emerges on its feet, and its body comes out before its head and feet, or one hand or foot at a time; or if its head and hand come out first; or if it comes out from inside; and perhaps turns around over its collarbone, then these forms are unwelcome.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent and subtle in all these matters, and to guard herself against error and deception. And I will demonstrate all forms from them, and how the intellect is in each of them, and it shall be made known through that, and it will stand over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges from its natural position above the mother's head, and it becomes difficult for her, and labor is now weakened in her, then make her sit on a seat or have women hold her; apply vapor to her private parts with cooked fennel and moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert her little finger into the vagina and find the second one with it, and cut it with her nail until what is inside due to moisture comes out; and press the woman's womb until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If, however, it does not descend, then she should be enema-ized with the mucilage of fennel mixed with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then after the enema, tell her to press herself; and make her sneeze with the condition, holding her jaw and nose at the same time.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The fetus will indeed come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If both hands of the fetus emerge first, then it is necessary to bring them down with ease gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If she does not obey at the entrance, then place the woman on a seat and raise her feet upwards; thereafter, strike the seat against the ground, and the woman must be held so that she does not fall during the striking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If, however, the hands do not come out and the fetus dies, then cut them open and extract the remaining parts of the fetus; tie her hand with cloth and extract it with equal care, for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The outcome of the embryo is on her feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out on its own feet, it should be gently pushed upwards; then, slowly turn the fetus around; afterward, leave it alone.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of her feet and slowly stretch it out.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come out as far as the thighs, then tell her to press and make her sneeze with the condition; for it will come out if God wishes.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out as we described, then slowly reduce the fetus until you place it according to its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will itself come out then with easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If all that we have described is prohibited, then take some mucilage of aloe, and oil of sesame, and gum extracted; and grind it all well in a mortar with a good pounding. Then, with a line, mark the woman's vulva and the lower part of her abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she becomes relaxed.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that her lower parts are heated up, then prepare a poultice of myrrh and apply it to herself.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she is holding the poultice for a suitable time, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze; and press her mouth and nose together, and gently press on the lower part of her abdomen.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	The heat will immediately come out.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The fetus emerges on the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When the fetus is emerging in this manner, then carefully insert your hands one after the other.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie down on her back with her head raised and her feet hanging down; she should rest on the bed and interlace her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press above the wound gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then extract what is beneath its feet from the particles, until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not emerge, then take its feet and move them with vigorous motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press what is above the womb gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then he should insert his hand and take the fetus gradually, and especially instruct the woman to compress until the fetus emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The fetus, hanging laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	The hand should be manipulated for reduction.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If, however, it cannot be reduced, then release the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her legs with violent concussion.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the liniment you prepared from mucilaginous substances.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she has given birth, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive to reduce the hand and equalize the fetus according to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and strictly tell her to compress herself until it emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	When the fetus emerges over its own neck, with its hands expanded and its face toward the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife must hold the fetus' hand, then gradually unfold it and make it easy.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is equalized, then place on its head what we described above from oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then tell her to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	After you have done that, then make her sit on a seat and tell her to lean toward the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then tell her to compress herself: and make her sneeze when ready.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The fetus' exit is prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the mother's opening in this manner with the secondine, then cut the secondine with your finger, until it is evacuated by moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If it is hanging over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the umbilical area; so that it does not hang on and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus towards the inside until you place it as it should be, and tell the woman to press herself several times; for thus it will come out through the birth canal.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	§ The delivery of twins or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that of multiples is rare and occurs infrequently.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Indeed, it is a rare matter outside of nature, and they do not live completely; and [the mother] contains them, even if they multiply, in a single secondine; and they are separated through the sifach, distinguishing between each other what is tied together at the navel of each.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And when they come out, as a single fetus comes out through the natural birth canal easily; they come out through an admirable birth canal, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If certain difficulties arise in their (the body's) treatment during childbirth and they reach what we have described from unnatural figures, then treat them as we have narrated: and let it be with fine care, doing what it does easily or slowly, and ingeniously according to every figure with whatever is prepared for it by ingenuity leading to health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder that it is formed in the womb from embryos, and some abort.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has already happened to me that a woman, upon aborting, emitted seven, and others fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which is measured by the glorious sage's art.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, all of this must be as it is in the knowledge of an obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps they may reach something similar to that; therefore, oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I mentioned in the process of division from medication, and it does not come out, and you take hold of it through an operation with the hand, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of healthy constitution and is not suffering from any of the accidents from which there is fear of her loss, then it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back over the bed, with her head inclined downwards and her legs raised: and let someone attend her from both sides, or bind her to the bed so that her body does not come out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then, moisten the mother's womb with moist oils mixed with alum, fennel, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then, the midwife should wet her hand with these oils and mucilages, and then insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then, she should seek with it the place where the hooks of the fetus are located, and the appropriate places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore, consider then if the fetus is prepared to descend over its own head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its chin, or in places close to its ribs, and under the ribcage.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If, however, the descent is above his feet, then it affects his chest and the middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that he should hold the hook with his right hand, and place his left hand's pad on what is between the fingers of the left hand, and insert the hook with the hand easily, and fasten it in one of those places which we mentioned, until it reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fasten another hook in opposition to it, or a third if needed, so that there is an equal contraction and it does not lean towards one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it should be extended equally, and not just in a straight line, but moved towards every part so that its opening is relieved, as is done with a tooth during extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary that in what is between them, the extension should be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If any part of it is retained, then the midwife should use some fingers with oil and insert them from the side to loosen what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore the part of the fetus comes out, then the hooks should be moved to another place that is higher; do this until the whole fetus has come out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand comes out before the others and it is not possible to reduce it because of its contraction, then it must be covered with a bandage.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then extract it until it comes out completely, cut it or make an incision at the joint of the foot, or the forearm; and so you must do the same for the other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	However, if the head of the fetus is large, or there is a contraction during its delivery, or water has accumulated at the top of it, then one must insert between the fingers the spiny Spatumile and catch the head with it and extract the water; or break it using an instrument called Almisdac, whose shape corresponds to that of the other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the nature of a large-headed fetus requires it, one must cut open the mother's abdomen; or extract the fetus using the Misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then, one should extract the bones with pincers.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	Which, if the head comes out and is contracted near the fork, then it must be found until the humidity that is inside the chest is drained.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	However, if it does not become complicated and does not obey to come out; then cut the head off as best you can.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If there is an abscess or hydrops in the lower abdomen, then it must be punctured until the humidity drains out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If the fetus is indeed above its feet, then its attraction is easy and its direction towards the mother's mouth is lighter.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	However, if it is compressed near the abdomen or chest, then you must extract it with the cloth that you have placed over your hand, and drain the abdomen or chest until the fluid drains out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	However, if the remaining limbs are removed and the head is brought back, then the midwife must insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	Therefore, if the mother's mouth is open, then she must insert her hand into the depths of the womb, and feel for the head with it, and draw it towards her with her fingers until it reaches the mother's mouth, after which she must insert one or two hooks and draw it with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mother's mouth is compressed due to the heat that has befallen her, then it is not necessary to struggle over it, but rather at that time she must administer the flow of humid substances, oily plasters, and sit in water that softens and moistens.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is above its side, then it may be delivered, after which what we have said about a living fetus is administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do that, then it should be cut off directly and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you do not leave anything from the second part inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what I have said regarding the hot apoplexies that occur in the matrices.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If there is a flow of blood, then it should be stopped with a sting, and the remaining cure should be administered.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed I have seen a woman whose womb was dead with a fetus within; then she became pregnant again over that same matter, after which the other fetus died as well.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	So it happened to her after a long time that an apoplexy occurred in her navel, and it swelled until it opened, and then began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I was therefore called upon for her cure, and I treated her for a long time; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I then placed some strong plasters on it; and the bone came out from its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then several days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I am therefore amazed when there is no bone in the abdomen.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I therefore thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I then examined the wound and extracted many bones from a woman who was in better conditions; and now, after such a long time, it sends out only a little pus from its site.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not confirm this foreign object here unless there is knowledge about it, and assistance to the skilled physician who treats with his hand.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	§ On the shapes of instruments necessary for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the shape of the stirrup, which equals the books, having two notches at both ends of two logs equal to each other.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this notch should be more subtle in the stirrup, and it can be made from ebony or wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of all the wood should be like two fingers; and each edge should be like one finger, and the length of each should be a palm and its midpoint; and in the middle of both woods are two additions of the same kind of wood, already fixed in both, whose length is the midpoint of a palm and a little more or less; and the width of each is like two fingers, or a little more or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mother's bone so that it may open with them when you reverse the two vertiges.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the vertige through which the bone opens.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	The other form similar to it, more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood or brass according to the form of the pincers.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it there are two additions as you can see above: and the length of each addition is about a palm, and the width of each is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you see how to open the bone with it, then make the woman sit on the bed, her feet hanging down, opening what is between her legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two joined additions into the bone, and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount that you wish from opening the bone's mouth, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of another vertigo than the ancients have named it The form that impels, by which the fetus is impelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of the almiscam, which counteracts the large head: and it resembles a fork, which has teeth at its extremity, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it becomes obtuse, like a fork according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like saw teeth, with which it cuts and grinds.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of the almiscam, which counteracts the small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of the near one who has a single spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of the near one who has two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of the fork with teeth like saws, with which the fetus' head is counteracted.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of the spatula with two ends to sever the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two spatulas, also broad.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are exercised, and the more kinds they have and prepared among artisans, the quicker their work is done, and the higher their reputation among men due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Do not therefore despise this instrument from them, but have it prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	It is inexcusable, indeed, the need for them.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	§ On the Extraction of the Second Tooth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second tooth is retained at birth, then it is necessary that you expedite the weakening of the gum so that it retains its breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make it sneeze when ready: and place your hand over its jaw, and its nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it therefore emerges through this, then it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If it does not: then take a cup, and drill a hole in its lid: and put in it herbs that open the jaw, such as calament, rue, anise, chamomile, fennel, dill, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and steep them in water, and place them on the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a tourniquet of rush over the hole in the lid of the cup, and another end in the jaw: and hold it until steam reaches the depth of the mother's tooth.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make it sneeze as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The second one will then exit with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	However, if it remains after this treatment and does not exit, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil or high-quality mucus.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then insert into the vagina and feel for the presence of the second one.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When it finds it, then take it and gradually stretch it out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If, however, it is attached deep within the mother's womb, then insert the hand as we described, until it finds the second one, and extract it gradually in a straight line, so that the womb does not fall during the powerful contraction; indeed, it must be turned to the right and left with ease. Then add to the amount of contraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It will then obey and be held firm, and freed from adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	Which if the womb's bone is constricted, as we have already mentioned, take care of it with sneezing and a poultice of herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If, however, it does not emerge with all that we have mentioned, then be cautious not to tire yourself further by repeating the process of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Indeed, it is necessary that what emerges from the mother's womb be attached to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then, apply a clister with a paste of four ingredients.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	Indeed, it will rot and dissolve after a few days, and then emerge.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it rots, a bad smell is released from it that affects the stomach and head, and it harms the patient.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, it is necessary that suitable fumes be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancient experts have already used nasturtium fumes and dried ficus.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The shape of the instrument used for fumigating a woman during childbearing and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Make one from another material similar to the alcama or from bamboo: and place the broad end over the fire; and put the fumigation over the prunes; hold it until that fumigation is consumed; and repeat another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the healing of the unperforated gut.
Caput LXXIX.	**Chapter LXXIX**
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born with unperforated intestines, which have already been cured by the subtle influence of sip (or perhaps a mild diuretic).
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, it is necessary that the midwife pierce it with her finger if it has not been done so already; and if not, she should pierce it herself with a sharp spatule, but be careful not to touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it a cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If, however, it is such that it becomes inflamed, then place a lead pipe in the wound for many days and remove it when the child wants to pass stool.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And it often happens that the gut becomes inflamed due to the healing of the wound or the abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it is necessary that this consolidation be cut away, then it should be cared for as we have said regarding healing and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	On the treatment of fistulas occurring in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LXXX.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are either a protrusion or an enlargement that occurs near the anus, or they affect a single space and can be one fistula or multiple.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that protrusion becomes hardened, it opens up, and moisture or thin pus flows from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes these fistulas penetrate through them.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, they are recognized by what emerges from their discharge and the strength of the patient's defecation; and perhaps something escapes from them that is a worm.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And these fistulas are when they penetrate into the space up to the urethra and even up to the rectum.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And these can penetrate up to the hip joint, and even up to the knot of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From what is recognized as a penetrating fistula up to the anus, even from one that is not penetrating, it is as if you insert your finger into the anus; and attempt to insert something thin into the fistula with air or iron: when there is no curvature.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is a twist in it, then insert into it a thin wire of lead or a hair from a horse's bristle, until you feel the wire, or a bristle on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it deeply, nor does anything come out of the wound in terms of discharge or swelling or pain as I have said; then know that it is not penetrating properly. So proceed towards cure accordingly.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula penetrates to the urethra or to the bladder, then its meaning is that urine exits from it, and it prevents the place from healing with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it is indeed penetrating to the hip joint or to the hip socket, then its sign is that the probe reaches there without any twist up to the hip socket, if there is no curvature up to the hip socket; and pain is felt around the part, and pus comes out of it always, and medicine does not heal it, nor does it solidify with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these fistulas that penetrate, there is no cure at all; and their treatment is toil and vanity on the part of foolish physicians, who are built upon them.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in those that are not penetrating and are not old, there is hope for healing with a splint; as I will tell you, and I have already tried it: and he should lie down between your hands on his back, and raise his legs up to his hips, and his hips should be inclined towards his breath.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then they insert a lead or air probe into the fistula's curvature, until you know where the attempt reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the patient feels weakness around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel that your finger's attempt is already penetrating by itself, beyond what you feel between your finger and the anus or the flesh, then you know for certain that it is penetrating; so do not exert yourself on it, because its healing is not like we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They also said that in some men, the flesh heals and a cure is expected through medication, by gently applying hot cauterization according to the width of the fistula, as mentioned before, and inserting the burning cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this process twice or three times, until you know that all the added and filtered flesh is now charred, similar to a feather's thin tube.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then apply the cure with lint soaked in butter until the charred flesh comes out, then apply it with ointments that nourish and solidify the skin.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it is never healed with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the attempt fails and it does not reach your finger which is inside, and there is a thick wall of flesh between it and the attempt, or if it is blocked: then you will see an opening in the skin following the course of the fistula, so dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and cut with the knife the attempt that is within the fistula, until the cutting reaches the end of the attempt where it becomes free, and it falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then purify these filtered meats, which resemble thin feathers or ear canal hairs, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	But if the blood binds you and releases you from the operation so that you can cut those meats, then it is better to cauterize with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because cautery with fire brings good habits to union, adds heat to those meats, and stops blood flow and dries up moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for it with lint wetted in butter or crushed garlic, until the place emits pus, and these burned meats emerge from the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for the wound with hardening ointments that generate hard flesh: and these are medicines which have stopping and drying properties.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when you restore (the health), then it is already healed; and do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	However, if a fistula has already reached down to the depths of the anus and is extending due to excess fluid in the body; then insert your finger into the anus and examine it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a trial (or effort), and between you and it there is some pain or flesh that is close to penetration; then there is no operation on that part, unless according to your trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	Which is because it (the treatment) is administered in three ways: either by cauterizing it, as we have said; or by cutting it off, until you obtain its concavity, so that it becomes possible for you to insert a ligature and effect healing from thereon.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too much with cutting, so as not to cut the fold containing the anus, and cause a hole to occur below without will (or control).
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of that as we said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it (the condition) will heal; or it will extend the fold, and clean itself after you dry it up close to the anus, as we said, either with a trial (effort) or with another sharp instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Next, cleanse the filtered meats that are in the incision until you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of the wound throughout with the incision, and the upper hole where it is consolidated; and there remains a fistula open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter on the inferior side.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when a fistula occurs in this manner: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take the ends that are perforated, which is like a sharp needle, that is, the preparing coria, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a threaded thread wrapped from five threads, and around that.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert a probe with a thread into the fistula until it reaches its depth.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If it is penetrating the inner margin of the anus, then extract the thread from that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus and extract the end of the thread, and join both ends together: and tighten them both, and release it on one or two days: and as much as the thread penetrates the flesh, tighten it well until the meats between the two ends of the thread are cut through and fall off: then tend to the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the fistula's opening is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in any way you prepare for it, unless it is located too deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not that you should not make it, but rather that you do not cut into the proper tissue because of a slip.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then proceed as we said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of a spinous spatula that finds the fistula, whose curvature is sharp and acute, and its other part is not sharp so as not to cut what is unnecessary, as you can see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	§ On the stitching of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows due to cutting them: and on the treatment of cracks.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids according to two modes.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are within the anus, similar to the seeds of figs or prunes; or as if they were new grains.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them there are small and large ones; and blood flows from them always, and it is one but many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside and at the ends of the anus.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are, for the most part, of little humidity, from which citron water flows, or a slight continuous flow of blood; and they are according to the colour of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment for what is inside the anus is, as you gently persuade the patient to defecate; and it is expressed until the anus is emptied, and appears healthy to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, suspend them with hooks or hold them with your finger.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them near their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If, however, they do not retain hooks due to their humidity and the softening of both, then take them with a rough cloth or with thread from doubled linen, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and after the cutting, apply some hot powdery substances to them to keep them in place at the site of the burn.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or, burn them according to what has previously been described in the chapter on burning.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then they should be cared for with the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the patient does not obey the evacuation of feces, then a weak enema should be administered to the patient in which there is a slight perforation, so that it may be relieved with what is present in the anus, and quickly obey the evacuation when the patient expels it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	However, if the external hemorrhoids are soft and easy to remove, then they should be taken with your finger or with a hook and cut off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then they should be cared for with what we have said until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And if one refuses to cut them with iron, then it is necessary to administer their stitching according to this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the soaked thread and insert it into the wound with precision.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then extract the hemorrhoid towards the upper parts and make it penetrate with the needle on its other side near the root; then soak both ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle and arrange them laterally, and tighten the hemorrhoid tightly with a strong grip.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread and extract the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Prepare that wound with all cleanliness and leave one part open so that excess blood can drain from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in pink or red oil over it and cover with another cloth; instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the stitches fall off, treat them with ointment and continue the cure until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	**On the treatment of fissures.**
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	They often occur from constipation and the natural constriction of the intestines.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they become ancient and medicine does not help: then you should use a knife or your finger to make them moist, until the upper layer of skin that prevents their healing is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they heal as necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not heal: then repeat the treatment with a stronger reason than before, until there is much bleeding and they are then cared for until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	On the treatment of wounds, both open and closed, and of ulcers, and gangrenes.
Caput LXXXII.	**Chapter LXXXII**
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that an almirmar (abscess) is nothing but a round nodule according to the color of the skin, similar to the head of a nail; it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers, and causes pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut off what is around the nail's circumference and hold it with tweezers or a hook, and uproot it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then take care of it, and if you wish to cauterize it, do so as mentioned in its preceding chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	However, from the gangrened (part) there is one small eminence, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And this often happens in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is to stretch the gangrened part, and cut into it; or tie it tightly with a silk thread; or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you see it, cauterize it according to what has been mentioned, either with fire or with a sharp medicine; and now the diseased parts are eliminated, not those that are inverted with an instrument which I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	However, the ant is also a small, filtered, thin excrescence on the surface of the body, penetrating deeply; and when it encounters cold, it feels like a bite from an ant, affecting the whole body, especially the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is to take a tube from the wing of a duck or a strong vulture's wing, and place it over the ant until it contains a circle of the tube's parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then, with your hand, turn the tube until you remove what is around the ant's circumference; and place it deep into the flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you see it, make it with air or iron according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Place the upper part of the tube at the base to draw out a dead, wrapped-up obstruction so that it can be freed from your finger and its own twisting.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you see it, cauterize the ant according to what has been mentioned about cauterizing the diseased part as described in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	On the shapes of instruments used for clistering in diseases of the anus, and for the treatment of hernias and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	**Chapter LXXXIII**
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes the clister is made of silver, or brass, or bronze, or forged and hammered iron.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes these instruments are made in various sizes, according to those in which they are used.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is administered for the treatment of young children should be in small quantities: and for those with weak or painful anuses, their clisters as well.
Clistere magnum.	Large clister.
Cistere paruum.	Small clister.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its stem, that is, the upper part where the uterus is tied, should be large according to this manner; and it should have a distinction so that the uterus can be tied as you see, and its lower end which enters the anus, blunt, soft, very thin, drawing towards thinness, and on one side of it there are two openings, and on the other side one opening.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the size of the opening should be according to the thickness of the radii, and a little wider, and the uterus into which medicinal herbs are put should be from the tail of an animal, or from paper that is shaped like the small intestine; whose root should be one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it is perforated with many holes as required, and there should be space between each hole that is the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread from raw silk, which is made of about ten threads or so, and bind to it the other one just like a surgeon does.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When the other thread is thus placed in it, tie it at the end of the catheter with a strong double twist.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then use the catheter.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle and holes as depicted here.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of using the catheter is as follows: fill the other one or use a warm compress from medicine according to the amount of tolerance of the patient; and make sure it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient should lie down on his back and raise his legs towards the upper parts, and place under him a pad, that is, skin or cloth on which people lie.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then soak the end of the catheter with oil, or white wax, or with mucilage of fenugreek, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then he introduces the same instrument into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Next, he should take the irrigator with both hands and squeeze it forcefully, until all the contents in the bladder are emptied into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then he should remove the bladder, and lift the patient's weak legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine encourages him to defecate, then he should retain it as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it that whole night, it is the final step in the cure.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	However, if he has difficulty passing the solution and his condition worsens, then repeat the enema until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or fissures in the anus, then use a mild enema, gently, from the enemas that children are given.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a mild enema, over which the skin is tightly stretched.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	**On the healing of head wounds without bone fracture.**
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have spoken about the treatment of wounds in the previous section of this book, and I will now describe here how to treat them with the hand and various medicines as required.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say, therefore, that wounds differ according to the type of wound and the location on which the wound occurs.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The condition of the wound often resembles a blow from a stone; or a cut with a sword or knife; or a thrust with a lance, wood, or arrow; and many other similar things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	Wounds that occur according to the locations in the body are also diverse, such as a wound on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or any other part of the body.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am describing the treatments for certain wounds in order to set forth this reasoning and rule for the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the recall of the composers will come at the beginning of Chapter III.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs in the head, and there is no fracture of the bones, consider whether it was caused by a stone or something similar, and has already damaged only the skin: then it is a large wound, and you should apply cold compresses to ease the flow of blood from the affected part. Act quickly and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately, without delay. Remove the blood according to the amount of force required, unless there is something preventing phlebotomy, especially if the blood flowing from the wound is in small amounts.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And the phlebotomy should be performed on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And the patient should avoid overindulging in alcohol, heavy meals, and excessive wine consumption to prevent further complications.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If, however, something prevents abstinence from food, then reduce the amount of food and avoid meat and wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And if a hot abscess occurs, apply a warm compress soaked in rose oil or wine with astringent properties to the wound.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	However, if you are free from the hot abscess, then apply a compress to the fresh wound still oozing with its own blood and not yet gangrenous; I will describe the kind of poultice to be used later. And if it has already turned gangrenous, then apply some ointment until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If, however, the wound is large, or it results from the incision of a knife, or similar, and its edges are not brought together with stitches, then these edges should be joined together with stitches, as I will describe regarding the wounds of the abdomen concerning their stitching.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	However, if the wound is already exposed to the bone and hanging down, without any tension except for a slight suspension, then it should be incised.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then, care for the wound with medicines and restore hard flesh to it in place of the skin, and especially instruct the patient to take foods that are substantial, such as grain and cooked porridge, until it becomes firm to the touch.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you notice putrefaction in the skin that does not adhere to the bone, then incise and remove the putrefied part entirely and treat it afterwards.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	However, if there is an artery or vein in these wounds from which blood flows and it does not disconnect through medicines, then seek help regarding the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it uncut, then dry it with a sponge or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, there is a need to do so when it does not respond to what we said, then cauterize it until the blood stops flowing.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If these wounds are small and simple, then their treatment is easy and mild; so that they heal over this wound as if no wound were there, because it hardens before it changes.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	**Mode of the Wound's Formation**
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of myrrh, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburned lime; mix them well together, and sieve it; then use it to fill the wound, and tighten it with a good ligature, until it adheres well above, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then tighten it from above with small threads and leave it untied, so that it does not loosen while it heals.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For this medicine is not removed from it until it heals.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And whenever it (the wound) becomes a hard callus and you do not have myrrh or dragon's blood at hand, these substances still perform the same function in many large wounds when they are placed over them and tightened; and they are recent wounds filled with their own blood, which has not changed.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If, however, it has already changed with some alteration of air, especially in summer time, then the intention of this wound is not (to be) achieved; so take care of it using what we have said, so as to place over it certain ointments made from meal, or put on poultices made from barley flour mixed with water and honey, until it emits pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for the remaining part of the treatment until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If indeed a fracture occurs in the bone of the wound and it is small, then extract it with the finger: and I will now speak of the treatment of fractures of the skull, as will be said in what follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	§ On wounds of the collar (or neck)
Caput LXXXV.	Head 75.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If, however, a wound occurs in the collar, then there is no distinction between it and the treatment of other wounds, and between the wound of the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If, however, a nerve or artery of the collar has already been damaged: then, if it is a nerve, there is no skill involved in treating it, except to take care of the healing with something that causes constriction, such as a bandage or a splint.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Since nerves cause pain and constrict them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything cold on the wound at all: for the substance of nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is higher among the members; and it should be treated gently with medicines, as a boil washed with sweet water several times mixed with oil, or with rose oil, and turpentine, when it is also washed with sweet water; and all other mineral stones, according to this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If, however, the wound is large, then apply a suture; otherwise, close its lips with small threads.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If indeed the wound is deep, or there is a cavity in its lower part where pus has already collected, then perforate it in a more depressed place within that.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If, however, an artery has already been cut open in the wound and its blood flow is occurring: then separate or dry it, and tie that very spot; or cauterize it if need be.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, the muscles of the throat have already been cut and are healing, then close the edges of the skin with stitches above the canal of the throat, and do not touch the throat itself, but rather equalize it, and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten the stitches gently, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments that have a constricting and drying effect until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, the wound has already left an impression on the bone, then examine it; and if there are fragments of bone within it, remove all or as many as you can, and leave what cannot be removed, until the wound heals, and the discharge from it is separated and drained.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle powder over it as I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	However, if there appears to be a bone in the wound and it forms a fistula, then treat that particular part as described in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	**On Wounds in the Forearm**
Caput LXXXVI.	**Chapter LXXXVI**
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there has been a thrust with a lance or a cut with a knife, and you see the depth of the wound, then consider the following:
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore a gust of wind issues forth from the wound and the patient grows weak from it, then know that this is a mortal wound.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and fresh with its own blood, then do not apply powder to it or press on it immediately, so that the blood does not get trapped in its depth and return to the heart, causing harm to the patient. But rather apply a strong ointment to it and loosen it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If you do not have any ointment at hand, then place a piece of old cloth over the wound to absorb what seeps from it due to moisture; and make the patient rest upon the wound so that whatever is accumulated in it can flow out.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If indeed three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasms occur in the patient, nor bad heart tremor, nor tightness in breathing, and you see that the rest of its dispositions are good, then know that the wound is healthy.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore, care for it yourself with caution and with the appropriate treatment, until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If healing indeed excuses itself, and it is always opening, then know that a fistula has already formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore, care for it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a cut with a sword or knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then care for it as its previous suture, if it was large; or with dust, if it was small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	However, if it has already made an impression in the bone and a fragment has been severed from it: then examine the wound, and strive to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If indeed they are not separated, then leave them, until the wound putrefies, for extraction of them would only worsen the situation.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment on the rest of the wounds' accidents in the remaining members is the judgment we have mentioned regarding their cure.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	On abdominal wounds, the exit of the intestines, and their extraction.
Caput LXXXVII.	**Head LXXXVII.**
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The disruption that occurs in the intestine can be major, medium, or minor.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the major, therefore, the intestine sometimes emerges, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why this intrusion occurs, and why their sewing becomes more severe and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the minor disruption is also difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that their reduction becomes more difficult if you do not proceed properly to their place immediately; for they are inflated, opened, and enlarged, which makes the entry difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	For this reason, the medium disruption becomes better: because when it does not make the reduction of the intestine difficult, as it is delicate in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the stitching of wounds is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	The two common stitches meet in the stitching of the abdomen and in the stitching of the rest of the body's wounds; and the other two stitches properly communicate with the rest of the wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper when closing the abdomen: and I will tell you each one with its exposure and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say therefore, because when a wound is fresh and something from the intestine protrudes from it, making it difficult to reduce, then that is why it is one of two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the fragility of the wound, as we said; or because there is an inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is thus, then you must warm it up so as to immerse a sponge or a damp cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or dissolve it in hot water with squinantum, cypress, and spices, and wrap the intestine in it until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	It makes wine within it, which has a constricting effect; and it is better than water alone in resolving inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflammation resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which other herbs have been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For it will also facilitate the entry of its humors with little difficulty.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	However, if his return after this treatment is delayed, then find in the rupture a small amount, with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the initial treatment is better when it is prepared, rather than cutting; and there should be no compulsion to cut after necessity has passed and the instrument is defective.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	That part of it which is bent, acute, and the other part not acute, and its tip is not as fine as that of a knife, but rather more obtuse; and this one resembles chalk, as you will see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the wound has healed and the intestines have been restored, then it is necessary that its reduction be made according to its natural form in its own place, if possible; for this is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When the rupture is extensive in the lower part of the intestines: then you should make the patient lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the intestines, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly, if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the intestines, then direct your attention and always consider that the part with the wound should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary that you should apply it to large wounds and to medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, apply it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it so that there is a faithful servant between your hands who holds the wound entirely with his hand and closes its edges.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then remove from it something that follows the stitching at some point, and this is the common way of stitching one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is necessary that you take a sharp point or a number of sharp points according to the quantity and width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then leave a quantity from the edge of the wound equal to the ring finger, that is, of the doctor, and fix the point outside in both ends of the skin with two threads, with two edges facing what is under the skin from within, until you make it penetrate from another part, and now you have joined together both ends of the skin and both facing edges, and there are four parts.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with a double thread around the wound several times on both sides at the same time, until the two edges of the wound are joined together decently by the stitching.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then release the thickness of the finger and fix another point in them; afterwards, pass it with a thread as you did with the first point.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Do not therefore cease to perform that with it which you need from the bed, until you complete the closure of the wound entirely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And there should be needles of intermediate size between thickness and thinness, because the thin ones penetrate flesh very quickly, and the thick ones have a difficult entry into the skin; therefore, they should be of an intermediate size in terms of both thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary for the needle to be positioned very close to both extremities of the skin, so as not to penetrate flesh quickly, and to open the wound before its healing, and not to elongate even with suturing, so as not to prevent the wound from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the end of the needle so that it does not injure the patient during sleep, and put small pieces of cloth on all sides to hold the ends of the needle; then let them go until you know that the wound has already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of stitching is indeed more appropriate for small wounds with needles.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Since it is enough in stitching them with one, or two, or approximately those needles.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	The second type of stitching is common, as it joins with stitching four ends together; two skin ends and two sides in one action, with a needle in which the thread is equally entangled in terms of thinness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, bring the needle back from the part where you began, so that the threaded thread falls from the upper part of the wound, in order to make a stitch, just like a stitch made with cloth to bind cloths together, and put between every stitch the thickness of a smaller finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	However, people know this stitch.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch, I treated the wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and there was a larger disruption of the wound, about one palm wide, and it had protruded from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and there was a disruption in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I then reduced it after the intestine had stopped moving outside the wound after twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	So the wound was consolidated in space, having taken about fifteen days, and I took care of it, and it healed, and after that it lived for many years, changing into its original state.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where I could not find ointment, nor anything from medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore placed two layers of old cloth over the wound every day and insisted on washing it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will now describe two types of suturing according to the description in this text.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is thus that one begins with the acute suture: introducing the blade from the outside towards the inside.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When the needle has penetrated the skin and moved along the wound, following the length and width of the entire body: leave one end facing sideways where you introduced the needle, and allow the other end to penetrate from the inside towards the outside at the opposite extreme.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	Having thus made the first penetration, then make it penetrate in this way along the same extreme from the outside towards the inside: and leave the other end facing sideways, allowing the needle to penetrate the other end from the inside outward; and as you make this second penetration, follow the same path that you used for the first penetration on the opposite side, until it penetrates into the entire area.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin again from this same side, and with the same end that was previously inserted, and extract the needle from the skin at the point where it entered.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then insert it back into the same skin, and with the other end that was previously facing outwards, make a new penetration; extract it from the skin on the opposite side of its entry point, and repeat this process until all sides are completed according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the essence of this suture is that it should envelop the edges of the wound as if they were a skin; so that you remove one part with one movement from one edge of the wound, and another part with another movement from the other edge, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	A second species of suture, as described by Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	He narrates that this method is employed by certain surgeons in such a way that they combine all parts to suit their natural disposition, applying one end of the suture to the other and the other end to its corresponding extreme.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I have told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You must now fix your attention on the end of the suture closest to you from the outer part and cause it to penetrate towards the inside, leaving the two ends of the suture free.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then, taking hold of the suture again, cause it to penetrate from the outer part towards the inside on both ends of the suture.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then, taking hold of each one again, cause both to penetrate from the inside out, reaching the other two ends of the suture mirach that are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is the suture whose remembrance has come before.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the discourse of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some have said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the abdomen is corrected with two hooks.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	Which is, as you introduce into each one thread by the other: and begin with the introduction of the needle, from that which is with you, and make it penetrate until it reaches the other side, according to the stitching of their skins equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the abdomen, then its suture is more difficult than those of the other parts of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the treatment of a wound, is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	Which is because when you treat a fresh wound with its own blood, before it is altered by air: and reduce the intestines, and its own self, and make it suitable: then place over it the poultice of the flesh.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the wound: then place on it some ointments which you have at hand, until pus forms: and the threads fall off, and it is healed completely, and miraculously.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then, care for it as is done for the healing of the other wounds until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	However, if you do not have these medicines at hand, then apply them immediately to it as soon as it begins to emit pus, and change the dressing twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For indeed, you do not need other medicines in most cases when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	However, if there are instances where the wound communicates with the main parts of the body in the injury, then it is necessary to immerse a soft cloth in oil of a moderate temperature, or in rose oil: and place it around the areas that are between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If, however, it feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in their intestines (for this often happens), then cleanse it with a warm enema of vinegar: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and becomes an exit that penetrates to its depth.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the thick intestine is easier to heal, and what is from the thin is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine called the jejunum does not admit healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its abundance, being made up of thin vessels, and its own natural nearness to the nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, what proceeds from a wound is pus, and you cure it fresh: bring it back according to your method of reducing internal organs equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If a space has indeed been left, and it has already formed as a bruise or blackness: then you must bind it with a thread above the place that has become discolored from it, so that there is no blood flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	In pus, there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place both ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside of it: so that its attraction is avoided, and the extraction of that piece near the case of the pus wound, and the release of the pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	**Reminder of the wound that occurs in the Intestine.**
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When there is a rupture in the intestine, and it is small: then it is possible for it to be restored in some people: therefore, because I have seen those who were wounded in their abdomen with a lance, and the wound was from the right side of the stomach, and the old wound: and a fistula formed, and excretion came out from it, and gas.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I therefore applied treatment, until I was not confused about its healing: nor did I stop subtilely massaging it, until it healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the wound had healed, I feared for the patient, that some misfortune might befall him and cause a harm within his belly; but no such harm occurred to him from that misfortune.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in good health, eating and drinking, engaging in sexual activity, taking baths, and adhering to his routines.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And certain experienced people said that when a wound occurs within the intestine and is small: then it should be bound in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is like taking ants of great heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two edges of the wound and place an ant on one of them that has an open mouth over the two edges of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When it bites into it, and clenches its mouth, the head is severed because it sticks and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first, and continue doing this until all wounds are filled with ants in a sequential manner according to the quantity of the wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then close it tightly and heal the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For indeed, there remain certain parts attached to the intestine which, as long as the intestine is fed and healed, do not cause any harm to the patient.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And indeed, it is now possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread: which is extracted from the intestine of an animal, and attached to it after being introduced into the stomach.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is also possible to take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it becomes much fleshless.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then, tie the end of this thread with a fine linen thread.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce that thread into the stomach, and use it with the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce the lump into a disorder.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of stitching with worms and intestines is nothing but according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is great, wide, especially if it is in one of the intestines' grat vessels: then there is no skill but to narrow it, and its healing is not at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	**Of care for fistulas and abscesses**
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You should know that every wound, or fistula when it becomes old and hardened, forms an ulcer, and does not heal, and always emits pus, and is not severed. Then it is universally called in any part of the body where it may be (fistula), and we call it "zuchemen".
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	Indeed, a fistula is a true hardened, white, filleted knot: without pain, but with a feeling of pricking; and for that reason some call it "risati", which means "penne".
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in some cases humid, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the humidity is severed at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this humidity is abundant, and sometimes it is scarce; and it is thick, or thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already explained in division, when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor any flesh grow in it, is not that unless for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is either for lack of blood in the body, or because of evil (disorder); or because there is hard flesh between it and its lips, preventing the birth of flesh; or because there are many abscesses and scabs; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter sent to it is of bad quality; or because medicine is unsuitable for its cure; or because corruption falls in the region, a kind of pestilence, or by reason of the property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where digestion of ailments becomes difficult, and healing of fistulas is delayed due to nature; or because there is one opening, or a certain number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have now set forth all the causes and signs of these conditions, as well as their treatments with medicines in division; and here it is necessary that I make you know the treatment of fistulas and incisions, which are made through a surgical cut with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore that a fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from these [fistulas] there are some that affect the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or passages; or they affect the intestines, or the ureters, or any of the ribs; or they affect any part of the spine or the connections of joints in composition, such as the hand and foot; and from them there are some that discharge near the primary member and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, when fistulas occur in this way, they are difficult to heal from the illnesses and do not receive treatment, and dealing with them involves labour and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If there is some fistula whose depth does not reach the places I mentioned, and you hope for and trust in its healing, and wish to learn about it, then accept attempts with air or iron if the fistula tends straight according to rectitude, and examine it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is a curvature in the fistula, then investigate it with a delicate lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Since lead, due to the softness of its body, is relieved and healed around its curvature.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If there is a fistula with many openings, it is not possible for you to point to it with your finger.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, wash it from those openings through its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	Since the moisture through which it is washed, flows towards other openings, and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then, inspect it carefully according to what is possible for you: to recognize if there is a bone or a nerve, and whether the fistula's cavity is distant or close, or if there is one fistula with many openings that covers the entire area with your greatest strength. When asking about the patient's illness, and when finding pain at the compression point with your hand over the place, and similar signs and causes of accidents.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	So when you have considered all these things and are standing at the right place, then proceed with treatment according to your confidence. If there is a fistula close by that appears, or in a healthy place far from a joint, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I told you about; then dry the fistula as mentioned earlier in my narration and remove what is inside it from leakage, and corrupt flesh, which arises at its opening from meat or something similar, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If there is a fistula of great depth and it runs straight, then you must cut it as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse that part from all corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply a clean, sharp knife to the wound and insert it into the depth of the fistula that you have reached with the iron, doing this several times until the acute medicine has corroded all that remains in the fistula's cavity from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that promote healthy flesh until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If it does not heal from that treatment, then cauterize it as we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If the cause of the fistula is a bone and you have verified this, then examine it and dry it as I have told you; if nothing prevents you from tying off an artery, or nerve, or a major limb, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If you therefore detect a bone that has something of decay and blackness in it, then cut through it until all the corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what causes it to heal until it is cured.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved complete removal of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, examine it a second time and make a thorough examination of its condition, and purification with all your remaining strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it heals, it is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is deep and far within the body, which you have not achieved.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	You do not have any skill in this unless you let nature discharge it.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the affected part is soft and it is possible for you, draw it out with delicate forceps suitable for that purpose.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	However, if there are many bones, then carefully extract them all, and do not leave any behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If something causes you contrary feelings due to humors, and there is no fear or error in making the incisions: then cut away those humors and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If you do not have the preparation to remove the bones at this time, then place a poultice on the wound that is causing it to rot; and leave it until it has rotted away from around the bones due to the flesh and humors.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And the incision should be constricted, as you have made it during your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	In my opinion, place over it, if necessary, a cloth soaked in triple-distilled sulfur and oil, or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some kind of radiant ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those putrefactions, that is to say moistures, have separated the bones from them, the sloughing of them should be relieved and their attraction removed.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	However, if it is a single large bone, such as the shank bone or the hip bone, and similar bones, and that which has been corrupted from it is a significant part, then remove it with the last reason, until that blackness and corruption are gone.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If indeed what is corrupted in it is a significant part and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it needs to be tightened and cut entirely back to where the corruption begins; then care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you of a case that occurred with a man on his leg: so that you may use this as an example and assistance in your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years old who suffered pain in his leg due to a condition that had arisen inside his body, extending upward towards it from within, until the affected material reached the leg, and it became a great abscess. And there was no external cause for this.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, much time has been spent on him with errors of doctors until the abscess was opened and many materials came together with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And the treatment of his condition was postponed until the leg became a fistula, and many openings were made in it, which all discharged pus and bodily humors.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	So it was treated by many physicians for about two years, and there was no skilled hand in the art among them, until I was called upon, and I examined his leg and saw the materials that were flowing out of those openings, with a great flow, and even all over his body had already become covered, and his color was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	So I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached towards the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	I then examined all the openings, and I found them connecting to each other in all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	So I probed and followed over one of those openings until I found the part of the bone, and I found it corrupted: already rotted, blackened, putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore cut out what I have discovered and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I marked that there was no corruption in the bone other than what I cut away and prepared.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied the restoration of the wound with long spaces filled with medicinal consolidants.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I attempted it, and I found, above the first discovery, a second bone with continuous corruption; and I cut away what appeared to me even from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted the restoration of it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I therefore examined it again, and I did not stop striking the bone separately, and I tried to restore it; but it was not restored until I cut away about one palm's breadth of bone with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicine, and it was quickly consolidated and healed; and this repetition of the operation and cutting away was not necessary for its restoration, except because of the weakness of the illness, and the lack of endurance of the patient, and my fear of losing him to death, since he would have fainted at all hours from excessive vomiting.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Health is therefore complete healing, and flesh hardens naturally in the place of the bone, and a good arrangement is made within its body, and it regains its strength, and it changes to its dispositions, and causes no harm at all to its walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	However, if a prominent bone in the body has already fractured, then it is necessary to secure it in this way, and so it is: take the ligament and tighten it at the end of the protruding bone, and instruct someone to gently pull it upwards, and place another ligament made from thicker wool around the first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind it over the flesh that is against the bone, and extend the extremity to pull the flesh downwards, and you will uncover the flesh over the place where you want to secure it, so as not to harm the cut.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a wood or board under the bone correctly, because when you do this, it will not prevent the rotten flesh from being cut.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that there be a secure fastening over the rotten place for a little while, so that there is no gap between the bones, and it does not appear in its appearance to the eye, and it is compelled to attach itself in its own way.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is rotten and not prominent, then its part continues with another part, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all parts completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the wooden splint below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Next, cut it from the affected side using a saw, until the fracture is completely joined on both sides, and the splint extends according to the length of the fracture, as we mentioned earlier.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the fracture is at the joint, cut through the affected joint itself, and saw through the bone where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed the fracture is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no skill involved except for the sawing.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the fracture is in the palm of the hand or in the toe joint: then the case is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	Indeed, it is necessary that you inquire about the fracture as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And you should cut it and clean it according to any arrangement possible for you, and with every skill that is rectified for you, as long as it does not cause opposition from a vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that cutting and sawing these bones require much skill, according to the position of the bone, and the preparation for cutting them, and their thickness, and size, and thinness, and rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary that you prepare an instrument suitable for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you the kind of instrument you need when you have a long study with it.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of these ways of this art is a testimony to the modes of sickness; for then you will indeed find within yourself what suits him from among the instruments for every illness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am firming up for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will set examples over which you will incur trial and proof on others.
Forma Serrae.	Form of Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Another form of the saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Another form of the saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Another form of the saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the saw is depicted, made with great care.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its bow be curved above, its edge sharp from iron; and its handle from boxwood, and let it be made triangularly with great care.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The form of surgical incisions is joined.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Place the head of this rasp according to the form of the locked star's head, and its points correspond to the form of the elastic hook's points.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not adhere unless the joined heads are rubbed with it when they become corroded or an extensive and large hole is created.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The form of the larger rasp.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The form of the medium rasp.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The form of the broad rasp.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the rasp where there is indentation.

Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of the rasp used for cutting bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The form and structure of the great razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a saw, and its end is like a blade; it is exhibited in many places for the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the saw that is appropriate for the reason that it pierces through bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, sharp at the ends.
Fit ex Indi.	It fits from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise, it is necessary that all that we have said about razors, and knives, and saws be done.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	§ On the cutting of ends, and the locking of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Head 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends putrefy, either from an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore, when you have treated the putrefaction with medicines, and it does not yield to treatment, and you see that the corruption occurs in a member, which does not affect anything else, then you should cut off that member where the corruption reaches, so that the sick may be saved from death or from the evil which is greater than the defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of one who experiences this is that the member turns black until it can be attempted to be healed; either fire burned it or it putrefies after turning black: until that putrefaction extends to the rest of the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, with the appropriate incisions, and similarly if the cause of corruption is due to the impact of certain venoms: such as those of scorpions, jellyfish, and similar creatures.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption or impact occurs in the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not allow space for the corruption to spread, so that it may not extend to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it occurs in the hand, then cut it off at the root of the forearm, and do not allow space for corruption until it takes hold in the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it suddenly occurs there, then cut off the arm at its joint near the elbow.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however the corruption has spread, and you see it around the elbow, then there is mortal danger for the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And beyond that, care should be taken, for it is a matter of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly for the foot, when sudden corruption occurs in a toe, then cut it off at one of its joints; and if it takes hold in the toes of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no cure left other than to release it and leave the sickly one to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way to cut the member is either by severing it itself or by tying the ligature below, which you should cut, and tie another ligature above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the assistant stretch one ligature below, and let another assistant stretch a ligature above towards the upper part.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, using a wide scalpel, until the whole flesh is detached.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is cut or tied.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you put a linen cloth over all parts and do not allow the knife to touch the healthy place; and cause an addition of wound for the sick, and post-hemorrhage heat.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs internally while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly; or put some powder over it that stops the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then prepare for your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded member with an appropriate ligature and tend to it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you of what happened to a man on his foot, the same thing that I am telling you about.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, since it happened on his foot, there was a discoloration resembling the burning of fire, and that corruption first occurred in his finger, until the whole foot was affected.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	The man therefore cut off his own foot after he saw the corruption affecting it with its intensity, which he found due to the pain, and the burning of it; and it was cut off near the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred to him on his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me, and I attempted to recover that superfluity with what I placed on his hand from medicines after purification of the body, but it did not cease, and it began to spread to another finger, until the corruption reached his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He then called for me to cut off his hand, but he did not want it, hoping from me the reversal of that superfluity, and I feared even for his life if I cut off his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Since the virtue of man was superior to the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he had despaired of me, he returned to his homeland and came to me because he had journeyed and had cut off his entire hand; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not related this story except to serve as an aid regarding this condition of the illness and its genus; and so that it is clear, according to which action it is understood.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	§ On the care of wounds and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	Head 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When a fistula occurs in some fleshy members and the space of the fistula extends until it forms a collection of pus, then it ruptures or perforates, and what is within it from the pus comes out, leaving an empty place as if it were a cavity; and the skin over it becomes thin like a cloth that has been worn out; and it does not reach its final stage in corruption, nor does it affect the mouth, or the bones, or the ligaments. It deserves to be called a "sinus" and is not called a "fistula"; however, if the space of the fistula extends until the corruption affects any of these members, then it is called a "fistula" or an "abscess.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the treatment is to cut that skin entirely as it has become hardened; and especially when it has become thin and like cloth, and you can be confident that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If, however, you hope that it will adhere to the skin and does not result in that final corruption from it, and if there is a thickening of the skin from flesh, then treat it with a clister; it is as if you were considering the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	If it is large and the pus that comes out of it has a foul smell, then clean it with an Egyptian medicine, which consists of equal parts of vinegar, oil, and ziniar, and apply it over a fire until the medicine turns red, and it will thicken like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; use this to clean the sinus with a clister, tighten its opening, and leave the medicine inside for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with expression; do this for several days until the sinus is purified and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is cleaned with a clister of ash water, if you do not have this medicine at hand, take ashes from burnt wood or from holly trees, and throw water over them.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then apply it and clean the sinus with it until you trust that the sinus is already cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then clean it with a mixture of water and honey to which some crushed ziniar has been added.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	It cleanses itself with a mixture of honey and wine, because of the property of honey to purify and wash, and wine causes the wound to adhere, especially when there is an excess of cauterization and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	You do this several times, and trust that the corruption of the wound has already been removed: then cleanse it with what causes new flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is necessary to take some dyafinicon paste and dissolve it in rose oil and astringent wine, or cleanse it with certain medicines and other ointments whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the opening of the wound is tight, through which a catheter for enema cannot pass, then widen it with a sharp iron, or put in it a moistened lint in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is widened.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly, if the opening is also wide, then close its edges with stitching and allow the amount that enters for the enema to be without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is raised towards higher parts, then dry it in the lower location that is in it, so that pus can flow out of it to below: because when pus is constricted in the depth of the wound, it prevents new flesh from growing in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus around its lower part as you wish, then try to prepare the member in a way that allows the pus to flow out of it easily according to what you have prepared.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try not to retain any pus within it at all, and take the consolidative medicines that are placed on the wound, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over the linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And the cloth should be of such a size that it allows communication throughout the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then, use scissors to cut directly into the sinus's opening, enlarging it slightly more than the sinus's orifice.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then, extend another cloth with unguents over it, according to the size of the orifice, and place it above the first position far from the sinus's orifice, so that the pus can exit from it: and do not remove the large cloth for a few days, except once in a while.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	The one who is over the sinus's orifice should be moved at all hours to allow what has accumulated in it from pus to drain out: and you must know if the flow of matter coming out of it is much or little: digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And consider again the place of the sinus itself; whether the lord of that part feels pain therein, or not; and whether there is a fistula there, or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	And since your treatment is thus, and you see the matter that emerges from the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus has adhered or approximated to the adhesion; then dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you have dissolved the ulcer, then change the bandage and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if a thin worm emerges from the sinus after a long space, then do not despair of its adhesion, for healing approaches it, since there are people who delay the regeneration of flesh in their wounds, and others who act contrary to it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if after many days a bad-smelling pus emerges from the sinus, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed, and its condition prolonged; then in the drying of the medicines, let the physicians make them such that they have humidity in their substance, and such dryness in their power as when added to it, excess of addition from moisture is removed.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last part which is being cured, take dyafinicon ointment and dissolve it with pink oil, and apply it over it equal old wine in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then make a wound in it with that, and use that very same thing.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does make a similar action to this one when you do not have the dyeing ointment at hand, honey, after you extract it, until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, aloe, and incense; mix them all together, and sprinkle that over honey while it is still on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then cover it with a cloth and tie it over the wound; apply to that which you extracted from honey until it thickens, sprinkle on some powder, and place back over the cloth, tying it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when it is administered with long aristolochi, and roots of celestial lily, and becomes a lily; also flour of herb and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple or combined, mix those, and sprinkle it over the honey I described; use that very same thing.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the condition of the sinus persists and does not heal with this treatment, then know that there is corruption within it; or it already leaves an impression on bones, or on the hard parts of other members, or on ligaments; then treat it with the same care as fistulas, as mentioned above.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	On the care of panary and inflamed nails, with the addition of a cut digit and amputation.
Caput XCI.	**Chapter XCI**
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panary is an abscess that forms under the thumb's nail, or any other toe nail; it may also form in the other fingers or toes.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When this condition persists and its treatment is neglected, the abscess becomes infected with heat or pus, damaging the root of the nail until it entirely decays, and the corruption may spread to the bone, causing a foul odor until the digit's end widens and turns black.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	If, after treating it as we described above, your care does not improve, then you should cut off the entire remaining part of the nail with a knife.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	After that, cauterize the wound.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	Cauterization is indeed a powerful remedy.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the bone is healthy and the nail as well, and the nail's edges are pressing into the flesh towards the interior and beginning to hurt it, then you should place a thin piece of wood under the angle of the nail that is pressing on the flesh and push it up; cut off the flesh with ease, and put over it what remains of the flesh from burning medicines or decay, until it is entirely removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then, treat that wound with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	However, if the corruption has already affected the mouth, then you must cut that mouth and extract the corrupted part: for it is never healed as long as the corrupted bone remains within.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see that the corruption and decay are spreading to the finger, then cut it off at a joint, as mentioned in the preceding reminder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat the cut itself until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	However, if the nail becomes damaged through friction or a blow, and there is severe pain, then it is necessary to use a leech to draw blood from the affected area first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail using a sharp spatula, cutting across it from top to bottom.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful so that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail; for you cause severe pain to the affected area, and it will lead to additional inflammation at the site of the wound.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the area with something that alleviates pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The real digit that is found in some hands of men may be entirely fleshy; or perhaps there are bones within them, and possibly a nail on one of them; and some are born at the base of a joint, or their origin is in certain knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, he who is born with certain finger nodes does not move, and he who is born near the joint of the finger perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, he who is among them is fleshy, his section (i.e., cutting) is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which is, as you cut into the same near its root with a wide spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	However, the one whose birthplace is at the joint's root, its treatment (i.e., cure) is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In him who is born in a finger near the last node, then you should cut into his flesh first with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of their saws suitable for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The healing that occurs in the fingers, moreover, often happens either from birth, meaning he is born with it, or from a wound's healing, or from fire burning, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary that you remove that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a thin layer of lead or soaked cloth in pink oil; so that they do not adhere too quickly, and keep them apart. Or put between them a thin sheet of lead, until the place becomes consolidated as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if there is consolidation of some fingers with the palm, then dry that consolidation according to what has been prepared and it is appropriate for the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	§ On the incision of a defect.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	These are the veins that are involved in the circulation of melancholic humors, which occur in many parts of the body; and their flow is greatest in the legs, especially in those who walk or work, and bear heavy burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary that you administer an expulsion of the body from black cholera several times with strong expulsion.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then the phlebotomist should draw blood from the veins of the patient.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these veins, indeed, is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they should be cut, and black blood should be extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And another method is that the vein should be raised up, and all of it should be extracted.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The operation of it, indeed, is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	It crushes the limb first with hot water greatly, until the thick, foul blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then it binds the limb of the patient from the upper part of the thigh to the lower part of the leg with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then it cuts the vein at one, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then it raises it up, that is, extracts the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and at the upper part it is necessary for the phlebotomist to cut the limb first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then it cuts the skin down to below, until a quantity of blood sufficient and as tolerated by the patient's strength flows out.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then bind it, and strictly order him to abstain from foods that generate black cholera, and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when veins are full, and hurt the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The extraction of his tooth is done in this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	If there are many hairs, cut the base of the nail carefully.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Next, insert the whole (body) into a bath: or immerse a portion of it in hot water, until it turns red and the veins bulge; or subject it to vigorous exercise if there is no suitable bath available, until the member becomes heated.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin with a direct incision along the vein, or at its farthest end near the knee, or at the lower part of it near the ankle.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with forceps and scrape away the vein from all sides until it becomes visible; and at its appearance, you will see it turn red and then darken.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When the vein is thus withdrawn from the skin, you will see it appear white like a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert under it a forceps, until it is completely extracted and comes out of the skin; hang it gently with a blind hook.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another incision near it with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then, scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then handle it with the radii as you did before, and hang it up with another hook as you did initially.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry another cut or multiple cuts if needed.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then raise it up and make an incision at the very last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then extract it towards the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you have extracted it from the upper section or all higher sections, and when it comes out entirely, then make an incision on it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If however, it does not obey you in being extracted and raised up, then insert a sharp two-edged blade and tie it, and extract it: or insert under it a radium, and twist your hand to every part until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful, so that it does not get cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it gets cut, then it will be difficult for you to extract it at all, and the injury will spread from that part.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	After you have thus completely extracted it, place over the wound a bandage soaked in wine and rose oil, or just oil, and tend to it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vein is contracted and has a twist that prevents its extension to the parts, and it is not as we said above according to rectitude, then you should find on it a place suitable for all its twists, and the places of its own extension.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks until you have completely loosened it, and be careful near your incision not to pierce the vein or lacerate it, for it will be difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore, guard your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The shape of the incision that heals the vein.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The blind fold's shape.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not as hard as the rest of the veins, nor does it have sharp ends that could pierce a vein; instead, it has great flexibility, being soft. If it were thin, it would hurt the vein with its thinness, but on the contrary, it has superfluous thickness, as we said before.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of the thigh vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot regions on earth, such as Alizegy and Arab land, and in dry, hot lands with little tenderness, that is, where grass or trees do not grow.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body, except the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed, its generation is from the decay that occurs under the skin, as happens within the bodies of snakes and internal worms, and parasites generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of the course of this vein is what happens in the leg with a burning inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the site is used.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to exit from that site of use, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When it appears from that end, then you must cover the entire segment with a lead fragment, whose weight is from one dram to two drams, and mark it; and let the lead be suspended from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Therefore, every time something emerges from it towards the outside, envelop that in lead and stain it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it extends too much, then cut off that part and envelop the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it deeply until it has emerged completely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and enters into the flesh, causing an ulcer to occur at that place, leading to putrefaction and a bad wound.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore, it should be treated gently and extracted slowly until the last part emerges from it and nothing remains within the body; and from this vein indeed some men have a length of five palms and ten fingers.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it has reached me, since a man has emerged from twenty palms (or inches).
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	However, if it is cut during your treatment time: then insert a knife into its hole and make a long wound with the body, until everything that is inside it of that material is emptied, and administer to the place of putrefaction with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care with the same cure for ulcers.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein, indeed, sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle joint, or even in the foot itself; and it has numerous openings, and a branch emerges from each opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	So treat it as we said in the division, and with what has been mentioned above.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	¶ Regarding the section on worms generated under the skin, and it is said to be a "boil.
Caput XCIIII.	Head 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This boil is called a "boil" in some lands among us; because it often happens to cows, and is a small, thin worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it moves throughout the body, ascending and descending; and it is perceived by the sense as it moves from one part of the body to another until it breaks through wherever it breaks in the skin and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes occur, that is, roundworms (lumbrics) and tapeworms in the gut.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And he (the surgeon) fears harm from his evil intent.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when he (the surgeon) cuts into the body and it is carried to the head, and reaches a certain place, then perhaps he opens something within and comes out, and destroys the eye—and such happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore trying to cure it and extract the foreign body, then this happens only during its movement, and with the appearance of the object itself.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to tie what is above and below it with a strong strap.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry it above and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it (the foreign body) is plunged into the flesh and you cannot find it, then place a caustic over the spot with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And worse than that, is the corruption it causes, which corrupts the eye as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	However, if you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then tighten a good strap under it.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry it above and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the patient use purification of his body with medicines that dissolve bad, putrid humours.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And he should beware of foods that generate putrefaction within him.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	§ On the section concerning the disease of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Head 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called Nakir in our land: it is a pain that occurs in certain members, and then it changes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have already seen it, according to what I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I have been called to visit a sick woman in certain parts.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she withdrew her arm, and I saw a little swelling in the vein at the end of her arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after staying for an hour, I saw one swelling move with a kind of pulse, as a vein moves, rising towards her shoulder more quickly than it can be perceived: like living silver running from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore the pain has receded from that place and is fixed in the humerus.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then, after a short time, it moves to the rest of the body, until it reaches the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	He then told me that it was turning inside his whole body, as I could see.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was amazed, therefore, at the speed of its change from one part to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I, indeed, had not seen before this affliction with my eyes in such a manner according to this way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who find the pain changing from one part to another; and they do not see it with their eyes as they see it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it is otherwise than because she was a woman of those who have such veins detected; from this, therefore, appears to the senses that change of wind has occurred.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and humid bodies, secret veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	If, therefore, you wish to cure it and the patient feels that pain, then if it appears before your eye, as we said, tighten over it, and under it, quickly; dry it above, until that vent is exhausted; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If, however, you do not see it with your eyes: then take care of it with the release of the body and with what it expels vapours, and cleanse them with foul pills, and pills of myrrh, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	**On the Extraction of Arrows**
Caput XCVI.	**Chapter XCVI**
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their kinds, and according to the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	The diversity of these is indeed great, for some have large and sharp points, others small and blunted; some are concave, others convex.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those that have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them there are those with tongues (or blades).
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them there are those with stars (or points).
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	These are indeed those that are according to the members in which they fall, and they are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For indeed the members are derived from principal members, such as the brain, and heart, and spleen, and lung, and kidney, and intestines, and similar organs.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls upon any of these members, and you observe signs of death, which I am telling you afterwards, then you must endeavor to extract that arrow from them, for death follows him in which it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these signs of evil do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and tend to the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	Among the signs, when an arrow falls upon the brain and penetrates through the bone, emerging above it, it is: for from that there arise sudden vertigo, darkness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of mind, and choleraic deliria.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood may emerge from the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And from the wound's site, a white, pus-like moisture emerges.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And from it, something similar to the moisture of the flesh emerges.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment and extract the arrow if it does not emerge.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the arrow when it enters the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and you feel it as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in something hollow.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow's motion is similar to the pulsation of a vein; and blood flows out from the wound, black.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And this is followed by extreme coldness, cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Therefore know that death descends without a doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of the arrow when it strikes the lung is the discharge of foamy blood from the wound; and the limbs that follow, the neck becomes rigid, and the face turns pale.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And the great, strong breath departs; and it seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If an arrow falls into the chest, which is a small space, then it is near the ribs; and it causes great anxiety with intense pain and deep breathing, and all the limbs of the arms move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the wound might escape through a side effect of food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow enters the abdomen and becomes lodged there: something of feces might escape from the wound, or a gallstone, or intestine that has already been ruptured.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope for its cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder and urine escapes from it: something flows out of it to the outside, and more intense pain occurs in the patient; then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining members, such as the face, neck, throat, tongue, armpit, spine, pelvis, leg, and foot, and similar parts of the body are affected in many ways; when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve, and is not a poisoned arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I have seen these arrows to be used as signs for your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Which is because a certain man was struck by an arrow in his tear duct eye and at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	I therefore extracted it from his other side, beneath the skin of his ear, and he was healed, without any harm coming to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from the Jew, which had struck him in the fat of his eye beneath his lower eyelid; and the arrow was already concealed, and I could only extract a small part of it, where it was embedded in his wood; and it was a large arrow, with a soft iron point, without wings.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabian arrow, and it had wings.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	I therefore followed it up between the two ribs, and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was therefore subtile in dealing with it until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow that had pierced his abdomen; and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed, there was no change in him regarding the arrow; so I took a different approach and extracted it, and he recovered, without any further complications.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I also saw a man on whom an arrow had pierced his back, and the wound over it had healed.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman on whom an arrow had pierced her abdomen; and the wound healed over it, and the arrow remained inside: and nothing changed from its position, and the woman did not experience any harm from any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I also saw another man on whom an arrow had pierced his face; and the wound healed, and remained, without causing him much pain, and there were many such cases.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted the arrow from a man at the king's court, which had pierced his nose in the middle, and was already declining to the right side a little; and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I am called upon, therefore, to care for it after the arrow's wound for up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I therefore find the wound of the arrow deeply strained.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I then examined it with a delicate touch and did not feel it; indeed, I found a puncture and pain beneath its golden right side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that it was the puncture from the arrow's tip.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I then applied a poultice to the area, which had an attractive and soothing quality, confident that it would heal the place, and that I would see a sign of the arrow, so that I could cut it off above it; however, no incident occurred at the site, indicating that the arrow had not entered the wound.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I persevered with the poultice for many days; no incident occurred, and the wound gradually healed; however, it remained weak from the extraction for some time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that...
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I then applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it with my finger, I felt the tip of the arrow that was adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added, in opening the wound, this sharp medicine, until the tip of the arrow became visible to us; and it took about four months for me to pass beyond that space with it.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had widened, and it was possible for me to insert tweezers into it and move them around, it refused to yield and I had to continue working on it with subtlety and cunning until I began using properly crafted tweezers on a certain day, according to their shape at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I healed the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the doctors judge that the nasal cartilage does not heal.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I therefore healed it, and the wound became consolidated and completely cured; not a trace of harm remained.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you about the quality of extracting certain arrows, so that you may establish a rule and meaning over what I have not mentioned.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and the distinctions between them are not comprehensible within the narrative; nor does the book understand it, and a prudent artist compares it with little over much; and with what is peaceful, he compares what is absent; and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descents of foreign objects in this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say, therefore, that arrows do not exit from a member in which they are fixed, unless in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or through attraction from the place where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or conversely, of the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which exits from where it entered, either it is an arrow proceeding into the fleshy part: it is attracted and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	Which if it does not obey to exit from the time in which it fell: then you need to let go of that for a few days, until the flesh around it putrefies: and its attraction will be released, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly, if it is fixed into a bone and does not obey you to exit, then let go of that for several days: and repeat the process with attraction and motion every day, until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not obey you to exit after several days, then you need to drill around the arrow at every part of the bone with a fine chisel, until the arrows widen.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If, however, an arrow is embedded in the skull bone and has already penetrated one of the brain's ventricles, and there appears to be some weakness from among those conditions I mentioned: then refrain from pulling out the arrow, and leave it until it becomes comfortable after a few days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the heart, then death is not prolonged for it.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except only in the bone body and does not penetrate to the heart, and he remains weak for a few days, and nothing happens to him from among those conditions: then one should apply to the pulling out of the arrow and its extraction.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed strongly and does not obey you to the pulling, then apply a wooden rod around the arrow, like a splint; afterwards, take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow is already absorbed into the body and hidden from sight and sense, then seek it with the use of probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If, however, you feel it, then pull it out with some instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	But if you cannot get above it due to the wound's constriction and due to the length of the arrow in deep places, and there is no bone, or nerve, or vessel there: then find a way above it until the wound becomes enlarged, and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If there are any parts that can be held, then free the fixed flesh from all sides, with every skill and device you have, until it is healed, without causing damage to the skin or deforming the ears.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the extraction of an arrow, wherever it is located, then use a twisting motion with your hand, using pincers on all parts, until it glides out, and with the final subtle movement, do not break the arrow, making its attraction and removal for you difficult.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot remove it at once, then leave it for several days until what is around it putrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat the process. Indeed, it will be cured then if, against your expectations, a flow of blood occurs, then apply what we mentioned from treatment in its chapter: and protect your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or chord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And use every skill possible to remove the arrow, and let it be with ease, or calmness, or slowness, or firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that when you pull the arrow, it becomes weakened according to its form, as it was near the case of the arrow itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more practical.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If, however, it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	However, if an arrow emerges from the opposite side of a part or has already proceeded from it to external areas, the tip of the arrow forms a curvature at the end due to the sensation from the nearby skin's upper part, and you will see it protruding: so dry it above and make a cut according to the amount that the forceps can grasp.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it, for it becomes easier to leave on its own.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is indeed retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness until the arrow presses into the bone and increases its grip: then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for a few days, then repeat the process until it emerges.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If there is wood in the arrow, then push it along with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If, however, the wood falls and you want to apply pressure: then insert a sharp instrument into it so that its sharpness enters the arrow's tail: then push it along with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If, however, the arrow is bent, then push it with an instrument into that very place.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For indeed, the arrow should be straightened through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to remove all the contaminated flesh, in which the venom resides, if that is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of it with whatever is appropriate for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow falls into the chest, or the abdomen, or the groin, or anywhere else that it is close to what you touch when you try to grasp it, and it is possible for you to cut across it: then cut, and cauterize the wound from the vein or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then dress the wound, if you see one, and take care of it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of pincers with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The ends should resemble the shape of a hook, made like iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not let go of it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And they come in many shapes, large and small, and medium-sized, according to the amount of the arrow's length, its narrowness, the size of the wound, and its constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape that impels (or encourages) the healing process.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape that impels (or encourages) the healing of the deafness.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the extreme of deafness, as if it were a radius, so that its entrance into the hollow arrow (or cavity) may be relieved and compelled along with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extreme of this hollow (or cavity) shape is hollow like a bird's wing, so that the entrance of the arrow into it may be relieved and its impulse.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	§ On the letting of blood from veins.

Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is done by shaving the head of the patient: and the nape of his neck is rubbed at the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, using good friction.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then the patient tightens his neck with a bandage, until two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And the places of them are behind the ears, at two depressed places of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse of them under your finger, there mark the signs with wax.

Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	The weak person should strain his neck much until two veins appear with a clear manifestation to the sense; and you should feel their pulse under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then indeed, the signs with encaustic.

Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then release the ligature at the lower end and place your finger on the vein just above the pulse.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Next, place a bandage and little twine over the same spot and tie it tightly; then release it until the wound heals.

Place the sharp point that is at the top of the surgeon's knife over the vein itself, and strike it with a saw or any other instrument in such a way, and allow the blood to flow according to its quantity.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	Then, solve the lower perforation and tighten it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And when it is opened with a phlebotome on its side.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary for the phlebotome to have a sharp point like other phlebotomes; on the contrary, it should have a wide end.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And hold the phlebotome according to its reversal, since the wound is close, and perhaps the phlebotome will break when it is thin.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	**On Phlebotomy of Veins in Two Lacrimal Ducts.**
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.

Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	For if the phlebotome is too thin at the end, it may perhaps break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	Then make it flow out of the blood as much as is necessary for you.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	§ On the phlebotomy of the veins of the nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	The veins of the nose, indeed, when subjected to phlebotomy, are for acute fever, severe headaches, and facial pains, such as hemicranias, and the redness that occurs on the face, especially when it is long-standing.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that it tightens the patient's weak neck.

Then hold the nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long phlebotome; fix it in the middle of its length, between what distinguishes the nose according to straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Since the vein is not visible to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary that you finish with your hand the operation with a phlebotomist shortly, and make the blood flow as needed.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then bind it once during the night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	For it is restored quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	§ On the Phlebotomy of Veins (from the Guide)

Sanatur enim uulnus.	Thus the wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	§ On the bleeding of vessels, Albucasis.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	The method of phlebotomy for vessels, as Albucasis states, is as follows: because it leads to a buildup of blood in the mouth and gum corruption, bad ulcers, fissures of the lips, and even those in the nose and its surroundings.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that you should make the patient sit before you and tighten their collar with a cloth.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	Next, remove the patient's lips and look at two vessels, of which one is from the right side of the lip and the second from the left; their distinction is shown by the discoloration of the colors.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And the truth is: because there are small, black vessels around them.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore, incise both sides with each other.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	However, if doubt remains with you and you do not know which is the correct one, then turn to the larger of the incisions and those that are more obvious.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly, do for the two veins that are in the upper lip; and indeed, custom usually follows this, so incise the two veins that are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	§ On phlebotomy: After the phlebotomy of the veins behind the head, treat the vein beneath the tongue.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	Indeed, the two veins that are beneath the tongue, when they are incised, provide relief for conditions in the throat, and the pain of the uvula, and disorders of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that the patient should sit between your hands in front of the sun; raise his tongue, and look beneath his tongue at one vein on one side and another vein on the other side; and the color of each will turn black.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore, perform phlebotomy on both; and be careful not to use your last hand in performing the phlebotomy.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For beneath them are arteries, and perhaps the flow of blood may occur from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	On the three veins in the forearm.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	However, the three veins that are tapped in the forearm, namely the two principal veins and the vein located between them, are the ones on which blood-letting is customary practice for all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And blood-letting from them takes place according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a myrtle-wood needle; or by using an olive-sized instrument to make it taper; or by cutting with a surgical knife, which is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is the form of it.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus is the Alnesil, which pertains to cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from these there are various forms wide and thin according to the breadth and tightness of the veins. The form of the myrtle-wood needle's blood-letting is broad as you can see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is used to open veins that are concave, full, engorged, apparent, thick, and those containing thick, cloudy blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this needle is of smaller breadth and more delicate tapering.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it comes to the phlebotomy of the subtle veins that contain the subtle citrus blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	**On Phlebotomy of the Basilic Vein**
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	However, the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, has the most favorable (or powerful) phlebotomy point.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it extracts blood from the ailments beneath the throat and neck, following towards the chest and vein; and the phlebotomist approaches it with caution, lest he be afraid of its artery that lies beneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	So if he errs and adds to the phlebotomy point, he will hit that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, it is necessary not to phlebotomize it with the phlebotomy instrument sharply; instead, it should be cut gently with an instrument such as a knife (or 'Alnesil').
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the basilic vein does not appear by its usual appearance, then you should look for another one and change to a different location, or seek out a branch of it; or phlebotomize in that place of the arm (the 'funem brachii').
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	Indeed, it (the basilic vein) is manifest, and it should be cut with the phlebotomy instrument (Anesil), as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If you wish to perform phlebotomy on the same arm, then you must first relax the arm, so that you can feel the pulse until you know its location.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the location with wax, after which relax the arm and use a concave-ended phlebotomizer as we described.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful not to strike the space around the artery's location.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that as you tighten the ligature, the swelling appears at the marked location with wax, then that swelling is due to the artery's inflation: so be swift in treating it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood during phlebotomy that appears like a child's urine, thin and red, then know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then act quickly, and place your finger on top of the long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If the blood is severed (it often severs multiple times), then tighten the arm and release it; and be careful that the patient does not move from fear: and place them above their fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for several days until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If, however, blood does not stop flowing and seizes you, and you have no immediate remedy at hand, then cut the artery if it becomes apparent to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For the extremities resist, and the blood flows out.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or accept the fistula's skin and find its middle point, take one half, and tighten it over the vein with a ligature and a bit of thread until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood stops flowing, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then attend to yourself with regard to the one whose memory precedes, from the place where the flow of blood from the wounds ceased: and the severing of his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, due to the small wound's location, and the possibility of binding it with a bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	**On the Vein-letting of Dark (or Blue) Veins.**
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The dark (or blue) veins, however, require a draw that extracts blood from the upper part of the head and the lower parts of the body; this is because it is composed of the branch of the Basilic vein and the branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it happens that the phlebotomist should be such that there is no fear from the vein-letting, because under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If, therefore, he adds a phlebotomy puncture and discovers nerve vessels, there occurs in it stupor, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it does not heal completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	However, if it is hidden in some people and is subtle, and it does not manifest: then you must place your phlebotomy where you make the phlebotomies, with the knife, and cut the vessels with the strength of your hand.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	**On the Cephalic Vein**
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	However, the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and conveys it to eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And in this vein, if you wish, you must make phlebotomies by pricking it with a sharp phlebotomy tool, or with a myrtle phlebotomy: because it is the healthiest of all veins, since it is not beneath an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is necessary for you, when making a phlebotomy, to take the head of the vein only with a phlebotomy tool, and seek a softer place, and it does not hurt him if it is not found with initial percussion, but rather turns over it with phlebotomy several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, in some cases, it may be abandoned when, after the first blow, blood is not drawn from him, but that apostema does not harm him in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	§ On the usefulness of phlebotomy and precautions to be observed therein.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy and its accidents, on which one must ponder carefully for its rectification.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	Firstly, it is necessary that you know that phlebotomy is not administered unless for the conservation of health and its continuation, and caution against the onset of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that phlebotomy is performed on one of the three veins in the forearm, namely the cephalic, the femoral, and the basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that phlebotomy is performed at the beginning of the day, on an empty stomach, and in the springtime, summer, autumn, and winter after a meal when there are signs of overfullness.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let phlebotomy be performed on the first day or third day after three hours have passed from the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, phlebotomy administered for illnesses does not have a determined time; but when occasion and need call for it, it can be done at night or day, and at any hour or time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary that boys be bled until they reach the age of fourteen years.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled until the fourth month until the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should the elderly, who have already passed sixty years, be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	So, if anyone wishes to be bled for any reason, he should cleanse his bowels before bleeding with a gentle enema, if much feces is retained in them; so that the veins do not draw harmful putrid excess from the intestines to the main members during bleeding.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient be bled when entirely sated from nausea or drunkenness until that condition is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor should an invalid be bled when suffering from hydrops.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let bleeding be performed again after colic, vomiting, intestinal flux, frequent coitus, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and everything that dissolves strength from the body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that; if the blood is thick due to food, drink, and medicine: if possible, correct that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Next enters the bath, if nothing prohibits it; otherwise, some exercise is performed to thin the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And then perform phlebotomy on him in the chest around the third day, as we have said, and try to make his chest empty of all bad animal events such as distress, anger, fear, and also from all bodily events like labor, pain, excess, and similar ones.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him make his business present with those things of which custom has made use among people because of their pleasantness, scent, joy, and similar ones, in a quantity possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the phlebotomist should sit on a stool higher than the patient; then he should extract his arm and rub it with the phlebotomist's hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he should tighten the ligature with a strap and envelop it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And the ligature should be firm but not excessive, because when the tightness is uneven or there is too much tension in the ligature, it hinders the flow of blood; conversely, if it is too loose, it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	After the ligature, the phlebotomist should then rub his hands together repeatedly until the veins swell and become visible to the senses.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist removes the blood with a small amount of oil, an ancient practice indeed.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he places his left hand's index finger on that vein in the place where he intends to make the cut, gently: so that the vein does not escape, and the blow is softened.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Since the veins are like cords that escape during bloodletting, and among them there is one that flows with great force; and when you place the phlebotomist's tool on it, it contracts under the tool, deceiving the phlebotomist, and the phlebotomist does not open the vein properly; and if he does, it is tight. Therefore, for this reason, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then the phlebotomist should lay down.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If the vein therefore opens at once with a single attempt, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then try again at that place a second time, gently or above the same spot with haste; if the place is not healed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If the place heals or becomes weak, then release it on the day, or after two days; and do not tie the ligature tightly.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps indeed the abscess draws in heat.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should the bath be entered.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he should perform bloodletting if necessary.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small or the blood flows finely, be careful not to draw out more than is necessary; then repeat the phlebotomy in the same wound according to the right method and add only a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with haste before the place becomes an abscess, for the place that becomes abscessed is a small one in many people during surgery.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see that the place has already become an abscess, then do not repeat over it at all, for nothing does it exempt itself from your attention.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something of the dreg of oil over it, for it eases the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And this is better in this place than the mere oil itself, and than all other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly apply the dreg of oil in all your phlebotomies, where you stop the flow of blood; and it makes a lard-like and wise substance when one of them is placed over that place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood becomes thin and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If, during phlebotomy, a great pus forms, which often happens, especially to those who are not used to phlebotomy, or there is only a small opening in the vein, then apply immediately and place over the spot a sponge soaked in hot water and salt; press it tightly for an hour, as it will resolve.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do that after the blood has left the vein, with its completion or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If after a few days there remains at the site some blackness or purplish discoloration, it does no harm; and if you wish, place on it something of aloe or myrrh dissolved in water: or anything from the juice of mint, that is, menthol or something similar.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And indeed, many times abscesses and swellings occur during phlebotomy in the basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore, place your hand on that spot; if you feel any softness during your pressure on it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	So, put something on it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood from the artery flows out of it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for her with that which is there, where the constriction is, so that the place hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you extract blood from every man according to the amount of his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the color rising above the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it be allowed to flow until it turns red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then let it flow until it thins out; and likewise, if it is sharp, then remove its sharpness until it becomes smooth.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And he who is full, strong, and needs blood extraction with one cut, should have the venipuncture performed on his side, and contrarily, for him who is weak.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to extract the blood from vessels, and that a tight opening be made; and better still is the administration of venipuncture, so that there is a crossed cut, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of venipuncture is safe from the flow of blood and cutting of nerves; and it is more commendable and healthier than venipuncture by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And if anyone is accustomed to arrive at phlebotomy after a fainting spell, it is necessary that he should take some food before phlebotomy with a little bread soaked in grenadine water, or secaniabin, if heated; and draw blood from him in three or four places.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the complexion is chilled, then he should take some bread soaked in a mild syrup before phlebotomy, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, or in an aromatic scented syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If a fainting spell occurs during phlebotomy and the cause is excessive blood loss, then he should take some meat broth and subtle aromatic syrup; and use aromatics with bandages, and press his chest with them; and employ the rest of what we mentioned in the division of fainting spells from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to restore his arm and drain his blood a second time: he who undergoes phlebotomy due to excessive evacuation and whose strength is weak, should drain his blood slowly according to his strength over several days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever truly wishes to restore his arm and drain his blood a second time, and he is physically strong: then he should do that after seven or nine hours, from the time of his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite side from which it tends to flow: he should do that on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In a body where much blood has been already heated and heightened, it causes fever; it is necessary that blood be allowed to flow out in one stream, and a great quantity be extracted from it: the opening should be widened until syncope occurs; after you have preserved all conditions of phlebotomy, and place your hand over the pulse at the site where the blood flows, so as not to cause death by syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	This often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and it falls due to negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you see the arm being released and the blood being discharged a second time, while the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of the blood becomes difficult, to press on it with force, lest the injured part be damaged or quickly extended.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a great evil; leave it alone until it has been bled a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with care during phlebotomy that which has coagulated from blood in the vein opening, and place on it some dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place on it some of the paste made from alfalfa or sage, and apply gentle compression until the blood flows out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If the vein has indeed burst, then leave it alone and do not press on it until the hematoma subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If necessity arises to draw blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either perform phlebotomy on that very place or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	However, the phlebotomy site of the arm's veins is at the fusca (veins near the surface) and basilica (deeper veins), if they are not easily found and hidden because they are composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that the patient should insert their hand into warm water until the blade turns red and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it should be tied above that place with a ligature, applying a slight constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the phlebotomy should be made according to the crosswise direction gradually, not longitudinally or widthwise, and the opening should be wide, and your phlebotomy should be through that joint of the hand a little above.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the exit of blood is blocked, then repeat immersing your hand in warm water and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your necessity.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	However, if it were the days of summer, then you should excuse yourself from immersing your hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	Indeed, the flow of blood into warm water is greatest in winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And phlebotomy of this vein is more salutary than any other vein, because it is not under this vein a pulsating or nerve vein.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	True phlebotomy of the salutary right hand is conferring with liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that you tighten the vein with your finger or hand, after you have inserted it into warm water, until the vein is bent and appears very much to the sense.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then the phlebotomist should cross it.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm that part in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful, do not use your last finger with the phlebotomist.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under it indeed are the nerves of the fingers stripped bare from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then return your hand to the warm water and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will clot in the vein's opening and be hindered from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	After you have extracted the necessary amount of blood, then place on top of the wound oil and salt; so that it does not heal quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, it is necessary that you do with every branch tightly.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The true instrument of this phlebotomy from his hand with the left is: because it is conveying to spleen diseases; and similarly do in his phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	However, the instrument for phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the matrix, and retention of menstruation, and kidney ailments, and old ulcers of the coxa and crura, and similar diseases from others.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is that a weak foot should be inserted into hot water: and make friction over it until the veins swell; and tie above the joint of the foot with straps.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the veins indeed are located near the calcaneus, appearing towards the thumb; and many branches radiate from it on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, make the phlebotomy on it in its wider branch, or near the calcaneus in its aggregate; because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If the phlebotomist cuts it on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are beneath it and on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy tool across from the phlebotomist as if you wanted to cut it, and be careful not to harm the nerves.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	However, if the outflow of blood is blocked, then immerse the foot in warm water and allow the blood to flow until it is completely drained.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the phlebotomist mistakes the vein at first, then they should withdraw the phlebotomy tool slightly and move it higher up, since the area is healthy, and do not be afraid of harm from it when you are dealing with nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The sciatic vein, as we said, is located near the calf on the lateral side of the bone.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the application of phlebotomy is to relieve the pain of the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the technique of phlebotomy is that the patient should enter a warm bath and hurry, and tighten the foot from the side of the ankle up to the calf with four fingers, using a thin, long tool, for it does not appear unless done so.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it becomes apparent, then perform phlebotomy on it as best you can, either directly or through diversion; and it is better to cut it with an incision or remove it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	Its location is indeed the healthier one, and it is hidden from many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If you cannot find it and it does not appear to the senses at all, then perform phlebotomy on one of its branches, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot, towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and cause a quantity of blood to flow out as desired.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then release the tension, place a covering over the site of phlebotomy, and tighten the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	It heals immediately.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	**On Drainage and the Nature of its Use**
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	They become tubes from horns, and from metal, and from other materials.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And drainage is performed according to two methods.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification and extraction of blood: and another is venesection without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this venesection, which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the venesections that are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are fourteen places on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is venesection of the alnocratis, and is last on the head; and alkehel, and is in the middle of the collarbone; and venesections of the algadhahim, and there are two plates on the collarbone at the same time; and venesection of the mind, and it is under the jaw in the lower mouth; and venesections of the two spatulas; and venesection of the alachosos above the end of the tail; and venesections of the two forks, and they are in the middle of both arms; and venesections of the two tendons; and venesections of the two cavities.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	Indeed, venesection does not extract blood from the minute veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that, the strength does not leave them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not necessary to administer ventilation either with fire or without fire in any illness resulting from congestion, until the entire body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If, due to illness or habit, ventilation is required, we administer it at every hour, at the beginning and end of the month, and at any time in between.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because there are people who, when the blood becomes concentrated in them, need ventilation until it is extracted, and they find a heaviness and soreness in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from them, some experience congestion and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from them, some experience itching on their face and forehead, darkness, and drowsiness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from them, some scratch the area of their ventilation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from them, some experience an increase in laughter.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from them, some experience a taste of blood in their mouth; either their tongue becomes detached and they spit out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from them comes one whose sleep is multiplied.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from them is he who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and those who are wounded, and sores, and things similar to them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When therefore we see something of them, and especially if it is in the third part of the month: then we order the wind to be raised, after two or three hours have passed from the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The wind treatment of the nape is: because it conveys weight to the head, and what flows down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	Indeed, it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this, indeed, is the wind instrument that takes the place of phlebotomy in the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted for one who has a cold complexion or catarrh to use this.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it inflicts great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And because of that, one should not use them on the elderly, and in heads that have cold ailments.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	However one persists in attending to it, oblivion overtakes him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for that reason, you must urge the windbag to place his hand gently downward for a moment, fearing the generation of oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Bloodletting using the windbag (Ventosatio or Alkehel) is indicated for cases of black blood (Fuscae phlebotomia), basic bloodletting (Basilicae phlebotomia), and it thereby brings relief from symptoms such as asthma, constricted breathing, instrument-induced fissures, coughing, and fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And the windbag must be gently urged downward, for if it is placed too low, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	The windbag (Ventosatio) is indeed effective for sudden pains in the head, eyes, half-headache (hemigraine), perforation, and tooth root pain; it is used for basic bloodletting.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you must urge the windbag to be careful not to use his hand with too much force during scraping; so as not to cut an artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	However, the windbag placed under the chin brings moisture to the mouth and helps with conditions like gingivitis and similar ailments in the mouth; it replaces other bloodletting methods used on both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	However, the ventilation of flaps is achieved through a combination of reflection and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	The ventilation of the inner parts of both these two vessels provides an aid to phlebotomy of three veins, namely, the Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica: for it draws blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh; and these small veins draw from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three main veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary to be careful with the ventilation instrument so that it does not proceed too far in the scarification, for the area has been stripped of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	However, the ventosa that is ventilated over glands causes hemorrhoids in the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary to instruct the ventilation instrument to be strong and made of air, for the location requires a powerful suction, and the delicate ventosas might break, and thus a significant scarification must be performed.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	The ventosas of the veins reduce the swelling significantly: for they draw blood from the whole body and bring relief to old pains in the kidneys, ovaries, and vesica; they induce menstruation and relieve congestion and swelling, and take the place of phlebotomy on two saphenous veins and the varicose veins.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the opening of the windpipe (trachea) is close to the opening of both pleural cavities.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the windpipes is to place the open end first in the vacuum and apply a tempered suction; do not prolong the position of the windpipes, but release them swiftly, and move them swiftly so that the humours reach the affected area with equal flow; do not cease repeating this process continuously until you perceive the place to be already red and inflated, and the appearance of blood redness; then make an incision and continue the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the condition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those of tender flesh, with rare pores, it is necessary to make incisions only once, not repeatedly; so as not to ulcerate the site.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And especially the windpipe (trachea), to enhance the incision, make it deeper; and regulate the suction with ease, swiftness, and its own motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to make incisions twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first instance, the thin path of blood clarification and absorption opens; and in the second, the precise extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If indeed the blood is very foul, then let there be a third incision in order to reach the ultimate result.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And for the ultimate, when we wish to extract blood gradually or little by little, a single incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	That said, if we wish for extensive blood extraction, we perform multiple incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it needs to be incised with a deep incision, and the depth of the incision is equal to the termination point in the cutting.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which needs to be administered from oils at the position of the Winds, and what does it caution about the flow of air?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case where the skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, it is necessary to apply the Wind position places with open oils, soft, smooth: if in summer time, as is the oil of almonds, or whipped oil, or oil from sweet fig seeds, or oil from pumpkin seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter time, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or syrup: and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If there is a thick, cold excess, then use amaranth oil or balm of galgal oil or white oil or aniseed oil; and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If there is a considerable swelling of soft tissues, then it must be prevented from oil and these places should be washed after venesection with rosy water or cold water or solar water or cucumber water or portulaca water; and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He, whose blood is of great moisture, should wash the wounds with vinegar or myrtle water and sumac; and similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	He whose excesses are thick, should wash his wounds with old wine or samach water or anise decoction or chamomile; and similar ones.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary to be careful about venesection in a bath or in a bathing place; indeed, after exiting the bath, it is necessary to administer for an hour, or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary for anyone to sleep after venesection.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	§ What is it that must be observed to regulate venesection or phlebotomy before venesecting?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, it is necessary for you to consider first: if he is choleric, either Ventosatus or Phlebotomatus, then sharp acidity and inflammation will attack his blood; then it is necessary to take refrigerants, such as the granatum (pomegranate) peel, and also vinegar, lettuce, and willow bark, and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And remove his food particles, and the meats he chews, and foods seasoned with herbs; and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And for one whose condition is cold, it is necessary to take in syrup made from honey, or water, or willow bark powder; and also to consume perfumed wine that is between old and new; and he should be instructed to eat less food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And remove his food particles, and chewing, and birds; that is, small birds; and let the pigeons' chicks leave.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of ventilation and bleeding be more than food; and it is necessary to give certain people in the hours of tyro (cheese) a drink of alfaroch or a remedy of moss, that is, mastic, or asselith before ventilation: and before phlebotomy or after; in order to strengthen the principal members, and purify the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary for them to take it in a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	On chest drains without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	The chest drains (ventoses) that are placed without scarification are those put on the epigastrium, spleen, podagra, and over the abdomen, umbilicus, renal regions, and anca; for these parts do not endure scarification.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And they are not sought after except by attraction from a part of the blood to the member, such as we place a chest drain over the nipples in cases of nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to remove cold humidity from the member, such as when we place a chest drain over the abdomen and umbilicus.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For indeed, it (the chest drain) rarefies the member, warms it up, and removes pain because of that, as it resolves that humidity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	They (chest drains) are also placed over the kidneys when there is an inflammation or a stone in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	By its power of attraction, it may perhaps open an inflammation or remove a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly, when it is placed over the epigastrium and spleen to drain the humidity from them both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these wounds are treated with air only when they are cut open.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are treated with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are treated with warm water in cases of pleurisy: and that is to fill the wound with a great quantity of warm water alone, or water in which herbs that are suitable have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	§ Form of the treatment with fire and air.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	It should be of such a width as the two fingers can cover, and in depth half a palm, with a small hole on its side, about the middle, through which the instrument may be inserted; it must be made of iron, steel, or brass, smooth and even, so as not to injure the surrounding parts, and in the middle of it let there be a cross-piece of iron or steel, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And this air becomes now great, greater than we have described, and sometimes smaller, according to the illness and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the air of boys and emaciated people is different from that of men and robust bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of placing this powerful flame over the member is such that it ignites the linen with a moderate fire, or a small candle from wax; and place it over the middle of the sword which is in the center of the flame, so that the fire is ignited around the lower part of the flame, so as not to burn the body below.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it over the member, and the finger should be on the opening that I mentioned, until we hold the flame; when we no longer need it, remove the finger, and the vapor will exit through that opening, and the flow of air will be immediately resolved.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then use the flame according to its mode, and repeat it if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in the case of the ventosa used to treat pleurisy with water, there is no crosswise sword or opening; and it is not applied unless the water is filled, and placed only over the member.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the ventosa is better the larger it is, as it can hold more water.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	## On the Suspension of Sugar-Plums.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 98.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Sanguisugae should not be used on many parts of the body unless their small size allows for the placement of veins, such as in the lips, gums, and similar areas.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a bare member, such as the finger or nose, and similar areas.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of their use is as follows: one should come from sanguisuges (leeches) that are in sweet water, clean from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	They should then be left in sweet water during the day and night until they become hungry, and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is drained first with phlebotomy and with veins.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then the infected member is cleaned until it becomes red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then they are placed back on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are inserted and fall off, and it is possible to suck the place with veins, then this is the greatest relief; and if not, then withdraw the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, it is rubbed and squeezed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the flow of blood continues after the operation (amputation), and that blood is oozing out, then immerse a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top, until the oozing stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the amount of blood is excessive, then apply pressure with a clean cloth or similar materials from the wound dressing until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they can be placed over the wound with half-boiled fabrics, and then removed until the bandages adhere to the place where the blood has stopped flowing.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And if it is necessary to repeat the amputation, as possible, the wound should be changed.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	However, if the amputation cannot be suspended, then the wound should be cleaned with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or fix the bandages at the wound until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they should be applied, for they adhere immediately when they feel anything from the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore they (bandages) begin to fall off, apply to them something of crushed aloe or salt or ashes, and they will fall off immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	**Second Part: The Goal**
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	**Albucasis' Surgical Textbook, Part III.**
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	**Universal Speech on Restoration, Dislocation, Healing of Twists, and Similar Cases.**
Caput I.	**Chapter I.**
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	**This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine, as it deals with the restoration of broken bones and the dislocation of accidents.**
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	**Know, O Sons, that the foolish doctors throw themselves away on this chapter, and those who have never looked at or read an ancient book from it.**
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	**And for this reason, this method is kept secret from the sciences in our land.**
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	**And I have never found it at all good, and I have not acquired that from it unless through the length of reading ancient books and studying above their understanding, until I extracted that science from them.**
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	**Then I adhered to experience and study through the length of my life.**
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from that in this Chapter all that contains my knowledge: and on top of what has passed, after I have abbreviated it for you, and set it free from the occupation of lengthening, and abbreviated it to the end of abbreviation, and shown it to the end of declination: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of the instruments used in it, with it being through the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	In conclusion, and collections from the existence of bone fractures, of those whose mention is necessary before we begin the remembrance of the fractured limbs, and various ones, if any one of them.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the Prologue of this Chapter, the main points of the discourse, and the Chapters to which one must attend for understanding the truth of their content: that you, and those who are eager, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when someone experiences a fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or some other accident: then it is necessary that the nearest ones attend to him first for bloodletting and cleansing, or both at once: if nothing hinders, like weakness of strength, or he who has suffered the accident is a child, or an old decrepit person, or there is sudden heat, or extreme cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be satisfied with his food, cold odors, and meats of birds and fishes; and abstain from wine, fat meats, and filling up with foods and every kind of food that engorges the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are free from the heat of illness and do not suffer from excessive discharge of fluid to the limb; then the patient should return to his usual routine, with which he had previously become accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the broken bone begins to heal, then the patient should be fed a nutritious diet with many rich and substantial foods, such as cooked wheat porridge mixed with water, rice, heads of vegetables, feet, entrails, fresh fish, eggs, and similar items. Also, he should drink hearty wine and other beverages like them.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	With this treatment, the healing of the fracture will occur more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in young men who are still strong, and in the case of the aged who are weak, it is not possible for them to continue and consolidate according to their natural state forever, because of the wasting away of their limbs; but those that are healed at the end of their weakness, such as the bones of children, will consolidate and continue in a similar manner.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature attaches a certain amount of glue-like substance to the broken bone from every side, which increases its thickness and holds it together until they are completely conglutinated and bound together; until they have reached their final strength and firmness, as they were in the beginning, unless something prevents them from performing their functions. And for this reason, it is necessary to provide the patient with nourishing food that contains weight, richness, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you should know that the kinds of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of members; for a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the bones of the skull; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and so too all the other members exist differently one from another. And I come now with a remembrance of all kinds of fractures exposed in its chapter, distinguished from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the kinds of fractures of bones themselves also differ.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because it becomes an arched fracture, besides what happens in it of stars.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes it becomes a fracture according to the length of the bone; and there are fractures of its splinters, that is, stars, and additions proceeding, as they are in a reed when it is bent with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And they do not proceed; and it is a fracture with a notch and disruption at the head: and it is a fracture of a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every kind has its own property, or specific tool for its restoration, according to what comes to mind regarding its remembrance, distinguished in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that which is known as the fracture of a bone, there results its twist and eminence; and its appearance to the sense, and the sound it makes when pressed by your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When there is no apparent twist in the place, nor does a sound occur when you touch it with your hand as if there were movement of the bone, and the patient does not experience intense pain: then there is no fracture there, but rather it may be a twist or a small fissure; therefore, it is not necessary to move it with your hand and compression completely, but instead place on it some medicine from what has been recalled, after allowing time for that which has occurred in the place to take effect. Then the tightness will be tightened gently.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should know that when the place arches and splits into two, beyond what happens there because of tension, nevertheless every part moves from its comparison; then you must begin from your moment to straighten it, equalizing it before it experiences a hot delay.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	However, if it experiences a hot delay, then allow it several days until the delay has ceased.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to any manner that is possible through gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and equalization is easier than the bones where tension occurs.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten it according to what comes to your recall of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If indeed there are tensions in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this fractured member from its two parts, if it is a hand or a foot; or with your hand, if the member is small; or with two cords, or with a cord and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And thus it is your position to place the member over an equal surface according to its natural form until when the parts of the fractured member are extended; then try to return those additions by every means possible and in such a way as you can in their places, and be careful, according to your strength, so that no pain occurs to the weak through your operation, nor any harm. And try, according to your strength, to apply one of the two bones with its companion, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And at that hour, you must try and touch it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, correct it and equalize it with the measure of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And be careful of excessive stretching and strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For often they cause a hot apostema or contraction in the member through their own operation, as we have seen many times from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then connect after equalizing, and applying a proper operation, and tightening that member, and ensuring rest, and tranquility: and warn the weak about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make it a priority that it does not move in the hours of its own will, and at its own rotation, agitation, and at its own movement, and all its motions with its utmost strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And to prevent this, let not the position of the member be such that it causes pain when moved.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	For this reason, when it feels pain or injury in the position of a member, then it is necessary to change it to another position where it does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And also be careful that its position is equal and straight, so that there is no curvature in the member when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the member's fracture is according to what I have described.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured members differ in their weakness, magnitude, and shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, for those that are weak from them, such as the arm, finger, foot, and similar members, then it is necessary to use a soft, thin piece of cloth for their bandage.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But for those that are thick from them, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary to have wide, hard bandages on them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the wide ligament connects the great member and tightens it from all sides of equal constriction so that no spot enters into it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after you have evacuated the wound from the equilibrium, apply a poultice of suitable consistency over the site of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then, begin to wrap the bandage over the site of the fracture three or four times, according to the needs of the member, and slightly tighten your hand with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then, move with it to the upper part from the site of the fracture, and tighten less than your previous tightness, which you applied to the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with the bandage at the site of the fracture slightly, and soften the tightness gradually, until you obtain from the healthy place a great relief.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another bandage, and wrap it again over the fractured place with times of wrapping.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then, move with the bandage to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your work be in the tightening and softening of the bandage, according to what we said in the first superior wrapping.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the wrappings a soft pad or cloth, to adjust the curve of the fracture if there is any, and do not put anything on it if there is no curve.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then insert another stitch above it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Next, equalise the stitches made from the centre, if there is no swelling or heat in that place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	However, if there is swelling or heat in it, then place a stitch above the spot where the swelling or heat sits, and remove the swelling; leave it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tie the thread above those stitches.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the stitches should be made from the middle of a wide, shaved, and skillfully-formed cane, or from wood where sieves are made, from pine or palm branches, or from a calving hook; and the width of every stitch, according to this form and figure, should be the same.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, the stitches placed above the track should be somewhat thicker and wider than the rest of the stitches; and the length of the stitch should be according to what is allowed by the member's size and condition.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie the stitches together with another thread, according to the same tension as before.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then bind it from above with threads carefully, according to what I said about tension; and it should be that your tension over the fracture site is greater; and as much as it is elongated from the fracture, so the tension should be less.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that they [the threads] be of medium size in regard to thickness and fineness, and made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are too thick, as is often seen in the clumsy work of those who use twisted linen cords, it is a great error, for the tightness does not suit them outside their natural qualities.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And very fine threads do not work either, for you will not achieve with them what you see through tightness.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's width between one thread and another.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the thread is weakened at its ends by the tightness of the stitches in healthy places, then place under them a piece of soft cloth or dyed wool until nothing is damaged from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and there occurs a disruption in the skin, I come to recall it in Chapter Two according to its particularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured member needs to be bound with threads from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	This is because when a member is large, you do not need to put stitches over it until after five or seven or more days, according to your safety from the event of heat removal.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of using plasters by which the ancients restored what was broken and dislocated.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common method of the plaster, restoring a fracture, consisting of many plasters, particularly for women and children, since it is applicable to what neither heat nor cold overcomes.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And take some flour from the mill, and there is a core of flour that hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the millstone; and make it as it is, except that sifting it with alum makes it better. And do not make its thickness too thick or too thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of the plaster, restoring a fracture, dislocation, and torsion.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almonds, laurel, acacia, enele, and mugath; and honey, of all these in equal parts as myrrh, and aloe half as much; and all these are sifted and mixed with water or alum, if the plaster for the sick is warmed.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	Indeed, it is a good composition, restoring broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of applying plaster, which also reinforces fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Prepare a mixture of equal parts of myrrh, aloe, and Armenian earth (terra sigillata), all finely crushed and mixed with water or albus (calcium hydroxide). Administer as needed.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method for applying plaster to joints and separated bones, soothing the pain of their injury, and healing cracks in bones and fractures.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take sucking wool and immerse it in vinegar and boiled oil, then place it on the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And this plaster is not a power of restoration, but it is good for the alleviation of the burning of blisters and it expels pain properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	A method of plastering that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take dried fig leaves and paper from the mulberry tree, mix them well, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	A shortened method of plastering, administered during the restoration of a broken bone, and when you see the remaining scar diminishing.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Prepare equal parts of the root of ginger, chamomile, flowers of marigold, and herb flour of all kinds; mix them together, and add wine if the member is not already heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If the member is indeed heated, then prepare it with moist coriander water or simply with water, and use it accordingly.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method for making a stronger plaster for resolving apoplexy, more powerful than the first, when there is a hard fistula near the restoration of the member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Prepare equal parts of the root of ginger, flaxseed, ballist (possibly a type of plant), melilot, samas (a possible spice), marigold flowers, and chamomile, mix them together, and prepare them with willow water, sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of it should be according to the warmth of the member and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a broken member during its restoration, except for a bandage made of lint and oil; nothing else. He told that it should be a medium between thickness and thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, observed that they should place things on a broken member during its restoration to reduce the heat, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, and similar substances that we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of applying a plaster that relieves the injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Mix equal parts of meal, chickpeas, human hair clippings, or bird feathers and alum, grind them, sift them, and prepare them: and thus an emplastrum is made.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The amount, however, should be such that the bandage remains intact, and then it is dissolved when you consider that if the patient does not experience pain, itching, or the broken bone does not move from its place, then it is not necessary to dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it happens that he feels an unbearable itching, restless pain, or swelling: then remove and dissolve the emplastrum at once from that place, and take a soft cloth or a wet sponge, dip it in warm water, and wash the affected area with it until the itching stops and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then allow the member to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place a cloth soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, on top of it and bandage it for one night, until you are free from the heat's discomfort, and the swelling in the member subsides, and its pain is relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the process, applying a tighter but milder bandage and a lighter emplastrum, without applying excessive tension with your initial strong bandage, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you observe that the ulcer, redness, pain, swelling and all other symptoms have completely disappeared, and you now need only a plaster and compression, repeat the process as you did initially.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If none of the aforementioned conditions occur in a member after three, four, five or seven days, then do not drain it unless absolutely necessary.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when after twenty days the entire condition of the member has improved as you observed from its drainage, according to what we said, until the fracture heals and the coagulation of the flesh over it approaches, then at that time add even more compression than your initial compression, and also add in increased intake of low-nutrient food, according to what was mentioned before.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	However, if you observe that the site of the fracture is already dried out and contracted more than necessary, then know that nutrition will be prevented from reaching that part.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, drain the member with warm water for all three days of cleaning, and apply relief compression briefly every day.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	By this procedure, the member receives nutrition, and healing takes place quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	However, what the ignorant healers do by draining another part of the member's fracture, when it does not restore according to what is necessary, and it restores according to its distortion, is an error from their operation, and a great fear; and if it had been right, they would have said so in their old books, and acted accordingly.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have not seen their mark anywhere on that at all, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	**On the Handling of Accidental Wounds in the Head.**
Caput III.	**Head (Part III)**
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	**The kinds of fractures are diverse, and their appearances numerous: their causes are distinct.**
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	**For there is a fracture that occurs from the blow of an axe: the blow removes the bone entirely until it reaches the sinew beneath, just as an ax cuts through wood; and because of this, this type of fracture is called axial.**
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	**Or, an axe may strike something of the bone itself, and it strikes its surface, and the cut does not penetrate to its end; and this is called a black fracture, that is, complete destruction.**
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	**And it is a wound of two fractures, either great or small.**
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	**And there is a fracture that is a crushing or grinding, and its cause is the blow against a stone, or falling upon a stone, or something similar.**
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	**And this fracture is also one that penetrates to the membrane beneath the bone, or is on the surface of the bone, and it is a wound of these two fractures, either small or large.**
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And from this fracture is one that is hidden within the bone, subtle as a hair; and it is a small fissure, hence this type of fracture is called Capillary Fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these there arises a fracture due to an accident or the striking of a stone, and similar conditions which cause the penetration of a slice of bone into its insides, creating a concavity; as happens with caldrons of air when struck, and part of them penetrates inward.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And indeed this most commonly occurs in the heads of humid bones, as are the skulls of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these types of fractures become separated, and I return with the recollection of them all in their proper place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures through the detection upon them, and inquiry with touch, and the removal of corrupted flesh which is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The true Capillary fracture is recognized by the fact that it is detected upon the bone, cleaned, and bandaged over it with wax; for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of fracture, however, consider first the condition of the patient; for if you see that from the accidents there is a clear indication of fear, as in the case of cholera, prostration, loss of intellect, loss of speech, fainting, acute fever, discharge of the eyes, redness thereof, and similar accidents in many positions, then undoubtedly he will not recover; and if you do not find that the accidents cause you fear, but hope for recovery, then begin his treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	What is it if a wounded person comes to you in the initial stages of their injury: and that is, during the colder days, then it is necessary that you should study the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all arrangements.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is during the warmer days, then you should aim to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the tissue beneath the bone degenerates and that condition we described occurs.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of a bone has already reached the point of touching the brain, and it is with minute pieces and attraction: then you should cut into the broken and crushed part, as I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And you should also clean the head of the wounded person: and remove the tissue above the bone as best as you can; and according to the shape of the wound, and what is weak on top.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If this happens to you during the examination of the bone, such as bleeding or a hot discharge: then oppose it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And you should fill the space with cloth soaked in wine and rose oil: and make the wound rest until the discharge stops, and be secure from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the cure of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The first method is to cut the bone with a sharp blade of straight edge, and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then, apply another blade (more wide) shortly after the first cut, and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Next, apply another blade even wider than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is to have many blades at hand, some wider and others narrower, all with their tips sharp, made of iron or tempered; and use them with ease by striking upon the blade, so as not to hurt the head or damage itself.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	But if the bone is hard and dense, then it is necessary to drill holes around it before applying the blades, using what are called non-drilling chisels; these are not so named unless they do not penetrate beyond the surface of the bone into the softer part beneath. This is because the rounded end of the chisel resembles a margin, and a very small circle prevents it from sinking or penetrating the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is appropriate for you to have many of these chisels, each suited to the thickness of the bone, so that there is a chisel suitable for every skull; and their acute ends should be in length and brevity according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of terrors, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of drilling around a broken bone is as follows: you place the trepan over the bone and use your fingers to turn it until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the trepan to another place and place what is between every hole and the thickness of the radius, or about that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incision tools what is between every hole from the bone, and make it thinner than you can from the fine edge, as we said, until the bone is removed, either by hand or with some other tool you have prepared for this purpose, such as pliers or thin saws.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to be careful not to let the trepan or incision tool touch anything that could harm them.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have surrounded the bone with drilling and separated it from the surrounding tissue, if it is still attached to it, you should clean and even out its edge that remains in the bone with another similar incision tool.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be thin and subtle more than other incision tools.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there remains anything of small bones and soft tissue, then take them with ease, as you have at hand from your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with lint and ointments as we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another way of operating is easy, quite distant from fear: as Galen said and praised it greatly, and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you first to begin detaching the bone part from the place where the fracture is more severe and apparent, until when you detect that part, and position under it the extremity of this lens-shaped incisor, whose form is this.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part does not cut anything when it is soft; and its sharp edge on both sides cuts along the length as you can see, so that the lens-shaped part is inserted towards the chisel, with its sharp face cutting into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike the chisel with a small mallet from one side until you cut through the bone easily, as is desired, and be careful from the cloth to prevent any accident that you might fear.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician is not more foolish than other men and less ignorant of it, and if he is not sleeping, then if there remains something attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it off with the edge of his lens-shaped incisor and free it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is indeed freed from him without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	If a bone fracture does not penetrate to the flesh, and what is detached from the bone is its face, leaving in it roughness and subtle adhesions, then you should smooth that roughness and remove those adhesions with the fine rasors you have prepared in various quantities, so that it is possible for you to apply them in any place more suitable, according to what the operation leads you to, and the shape of the fractured bone itself.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer according to your judgment, how much of those rasors you first used on the bone.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use the finer ones after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity until you reach the point of administering the thinnest and subtlest of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In the case of any remaining small cracks or subtle fractures, you should administer care according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter that should not be hidden from anyone who has any study in this art, and it stands over what we have written and demonstrated regarding large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, the skin is detected and retained when you remove the bone, then it is necessary to take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth, making it as comfortable as possible so that it does not hurt.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply a broad ligature above it, but do not tighten it unless necessary to hold the wound; release it after one or two days of this treatment until you are free from fever's departure.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it and apply medications such as lily roots, herb flour, turd silk, aristolochia, and similar substances to remove the dryness; make a powder from these drugs that can be applied to the wound like a dry crust.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply any medicine that has the property of removing it without causing pain or irritation.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And be careful according to your ability so that the wound is clean during your treatment; do not allow it to become dirty with ointment or filth.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Do not let pus form on it at all; for when pus collects over the skin of the brain, it corrupts and putrefies it, causing great harm afterward; this has already happened in a patient's head when the bone is cleaned by him, especially when his care is neglected, resulting in discoloration on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider then if an unfortunate accident occurs, as we have described, you should know that it is certainly harmful and likely to cause great damage.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackening does not occur, except due to the medicine placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackening, then you should take one part honey, three parts rose oil, and a cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it on the wound; afterward, care for the wound with suitable curative agents until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	§ On the restoration of our body when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the nose is not broken except at both its upper parts simultaneously, or at least one of them; for it consists of two bones, and the lower part is cartilaginous, so it does not break, but only suffers from friction, distortion, and compression.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts of the nose breaks, then you should insert a thin finger into the nasal hole and equalize the fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and it should be done skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And moreover, so as not to cause that pain in the patient through your operation.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If there is a fracture in the upper part of the nose and it does not reach the tip of the finger, then it should be adjusted so that it aligns with the end of the radius, where there is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed there is a fracture in both parts, then do it like this: and nearby with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the time of the patient's comfort from heat.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert a thin strip of linen into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part, or insert two strips if the fracture is in both parts, and let the thickness of the linen be such that it fills the nasal hole.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some ancient restorers have said that linen should be dipped in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That does not seem right to me; rather, linen should be soaked in a paste made with ground almonds.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the linen until the bone hardens and the cartilage solidifies.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a quill of a duck's wing is introduced into the nose where a thin cloth has been inserted, and it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, so that the patient is not hindered from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not a necessary thing.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do that; and if you wish, do the latter.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If, while operating on the nose again, the wound should become infected, apply a warm poultice to the nose with lint or cotton dipped in rose oil or a small amount of ointment.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	However, if there is no sign of a hot infection, then it is necessary to apply a poultice with sesame flour and dust from the husk of a date palm.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft pad over it, and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If the bones of the nose are indeed broken or crushed, then you must cut them apart and extract the pieces with the instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then use the appropriate cutting tool, and treat it with whatever helps it to heal and solidify from the suitable poultices or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs between the nose and eye, then it is necessary to treat it with liniments, and insert a lead cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	**Chapter V. Head**
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then note if there is merely an external fracture, not splitting into two parts, and it heals from the inside, then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if there is a fracture in the right part of it (the jaw), insert your left index finger into the lower left tooth; likewise, if the fracture is in the left mandible, then insert the right hand index finger; and push with it the deformity of the fracture inwardly towards the exterior with your other hand from the inner side of the bone correctly and evenly.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the lower jaw is already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer an extension to both parts according to their correct alignment; until it becomes possible to equalize them.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	However, if it has already happened that there is a disturbance or dislocation of the teeth: then bind them with what you hope will remain, using gold, silver, or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a piece of cloth over the broken mandible.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over it a doubled cloth, and on top of that a large, neatly made pad: or a piece of skin from the sole of the foot equal in length to the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it firmly from above, according to the preparation of its ligature, and let its application continue until it is not destroyed; and especially instruct the patient to use tranquility and quietude, and give him light food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you estimate that any change of form has already occurred in some way, then approach it and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten what has been altered from it, and apply a plaster made of ground flour, with albut or sesame flour after you have removed the cloth; and place a soft woolen cloth on top of the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	So long as that plaster remains attached and the arrangement of the bones is not altered, do not loosen it, until healing has occurred; or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often tightened in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, an abscess should occur during this time, then administer what we have said many times for its relief, until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if there is a fracture with a wound, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	If a fragment has become separated from the bone, either a small piece or a large one, then be delicate in this regard, so as to remove those fragments of the bone with the instruments at your disposal.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If the wound opening is tight, then widen it with a phlebotom according to the amount needed by you.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed those fragments and nothing remains of them, open the wound again if it is wide, and if not, place over it the appropriate dressings and leave it to heal.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	§ On the restoration of the furcula (fork) when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Head VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the furcula is most often broken from its anterior part near the shoulder, and the fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or it may break and separate into two parts, other than when fractures occur within the bone, and then its restoration is easier.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or so that fractures occur within the bone: and then its restoration is more difficult.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Thus, in the case of a fracture with an open wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in such a case when there is no open wound is as follows: you must have two assistants, one holding the fractured bone in place while the other extends the neck towards the affected part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then equalize the fracture with your fingers until its shape is correct, so that there is neither a protrusion nor a depression.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need further extension, then you must place a small ball of cloth or wool under the fracture and adjust its size according to your needs, then extend and lift the fractured bone with your hand until it is equalized.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot pull the end of the bone towards the exterior because it has gone deep inside, then the patient must lie on his side and place a medium-sized pebble under his elbow, and have an assistant press down on his arm until the opening of the fracture moves up to the surface, at which point you can equalize the fracture with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	However, if you feel that there is a lodged piece of bone from the fracture, which moves, then you must locate it and carefully extract it.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is retained in the bone, then use a cutting tool that you have prepared for that purpose, after placing under the furca an instrument that preserves safety; and the instrument is of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is shaped like a snail shell, without any indentation.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width is according to the need of that part from the magnitude of the bones and the thickness of it.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	However, its length is also according to what is possible for you during the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two ends, as you can see: one end is wide, and the other is narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the wound that you made when extracting the bone shard is wide, and you are secure from further damage by heat, then sew together two edges of the wound with stitches.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the wound is small or there is no further damage by heat, then fill the wound with cloth and small stitches according to the amount of the wounded cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If there is an infection due to heat, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine and place it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The true stiffness of the bone when it is without a fracture or incision is like placing over the bone a plaster made from ground flour and alum.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft pad over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its swelling, if necessary.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a bandage, that is, the long cloth used by the Saracens, which should be at least one palm wide, or somewhat less.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled cloth over the swelling and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a star-shaped piece of thin wood, whose width and length are each the size of three fingers.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the star-shaped piece inside, in the appropriate place over the fracture and its area.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the plaster over the fracture as desired, and wrap it around the collarbone and under the healthy and weak swellings, and bring it down over all parts, and as you can see, the stiffness holds the fracture firmly in place; and it is not hidden above you, and all together, so that the star-shaped piece does not move from the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, you must look at the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever the swelling subsides and you see the joint start to move again, then straighten it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the patient's sleep on his back and put under his pillow a little of warm water by his side at night, so that when he turns, help will come to him from his own side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Thus, the fracture of the fork will be reduced by raising the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or tie the arm to the collarbone; and do not loosen the ligature unless some accident happens from itching or dislocation, until after twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster if you see it coming off from his face towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the compression, and leave it alone until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed, the fracture of the fork is compressed and healed within twenty-eight days; and it happens in some men more quickly.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	# On the Restoration of the Fork Fracture.
Caput VII.	Head VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The spatula rarely breaks, and only at its wide end; it does not break off from that part unless the edge gives way.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore the part breaks off from that point and breaks in the middle of it, and is not recognized except by touch, then according to the form of the fracture attempt its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it according to the natural form of every possible skill to you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place a layer of flour on the millstone with alum and a soft cloth, and put a small piece of doubled cloth on top.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place on top of it a broad lattice made of thin wood according to the size of the spatula or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If indeed there is a hollow in some parts of the spatula, then equalize that hollow with the soft cloth until the lattice descends according to its equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then gently pull it with a long and tight string, until the lattice does not move from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the string every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the ligament softens, tighten it and restore it to its original position if it has moved; and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula will be restored in twenty days, or in thirty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is reached, then loosen the ligament; and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is made of bones whose joints are not to be feared, nor their dislocation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	However, if it proceeds from a fractured bone and irritates under the skin, then cut above it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we said regarding the fracture of the fork from the heat of the fire if something happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	**On the restoration of the fractured chest**
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes fractures in the middle of itself, and it rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities break most easily and become fractured from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle part of his leg, which bends towards the lower part, is broken and causes unbearable pain, as well as difficulty in breathing and coughing, and perhaps he loses blood, and the fragility of the broken bone becomes apparent to the senses, its restoration is such that the patient can rest on his back again, and place a poultice between his legs.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders and join the ribs to both parts or sides with the hands, and adjust it delicately until its shape returns to the bone's natural form as required.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and a compress on top of it, and put a lattice made of thin wood from willow or chalk, and similar light materials over it after you wrap it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then gently wrap it around the broken bone to prevent movement, and tie it with the bandage according to its curvature towards the back several times, and tighten the knot securely.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then regularly check the bandage and tighten it whenever it loosens, and if its need prompts its dissolution near the itching or corrosion that occurs at the site, or pain, or swelling, then remove it, loosen the bandage, and correct what has occurred during the course of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster if you see it is bulging, and attach a new bandage to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	On the restoration of the ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	**Chapter IX**
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You should know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur unless there are significant areas following the spine and extending from their ends towards the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they do not suffer friction unless because they are cartilage-like.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of itself is not hidden from sense upon inquiry with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done in such a way that the fracture is restored with fingers according to the possible manner until it achieves the form, as it should be.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply poultices, and tighten the broken bone with strings if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is inclining towards the interior, then a severe pain, as well as a piercing, occurs, similar to that piercing which happens to those who have pleurisy: for the bone pierces the membrane, and also there occurs difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood: and this is a difficult healing.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients have already devised many ingenious methods for it: and among them are those who say that you should give to the patient foods that produce inflammation and venting, so as to inflame the bowels, and extend them, and drive the fracture out towards the exterior.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We should indeed avoid it, so that a rapid cause for making a hot fistula does not occur, if it is not necessary.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	However, if it has already occurred, then add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: A flow should be placed over the place, then it should be drawn out with force, and it is more in line with reason.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, there is fear that the flow will attract too much to the place due to the weakness of arrangement.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: The place should be cooperating with the wool which is already submerged in hot oil: and small pieces should be placed between the bones, until it is filled; so that there is an equal ligature when they insert it according to the curvature.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the patient cares for the healing of the pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the patient is in great distress, to such an extent that he does not tolerate it, and the bone pierces the membrane with painful stabbing, and we fear for the patient's condition: then we must break open the place above, and remove the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we place an instrument that maintains the cure, whose memory preceded: and we cut the bone with ease, and we cut it itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we will bring together the two edges of the wound if it is large and requires stitching: and we will treat it with bandages until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If, meanwhile, a hot abscess develops, then apply it with suitable remedies and insert small pieces of rose-colored oil into it, and place a covering over it: and the patient will be cured by what is appropriate for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Also, the patient's body should be turned over onto their side where they sleep until they heal.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	§ On the restoration of fractures of the spine and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, a fracture of the bones of the neck often occurs and rarely does friction happen to them: likewise, the bones of the spine too.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When this happens to someone, and you want to know whether they will heal or not, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see that their hand is already softening, and numb, and dead; and they cannot move it, nor stretch it out, nor contract it; and when you press it with your fingers or prick it with a point, they feel no sensation or pain: then know, that they will not heal, and in many cases it is fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If, when moved, they feel a tightness with the fingers and a puncture, then know that the back of the bone is sound, and that the patient will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If it affects the spine in a similar way, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider his feet: if you see that they have become soft, and this happens to them as it does to his hands, then when he lies on his back, breathlessness and straining occur without willing; and when he turns over on his belly, the straining occurs without willing; and when he turns over on his back again and wants to move, but cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not despair in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If indeed nothing of that happens to him, the condition is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what happens from that is as follows: to apply a poultice of cooled rose oil only on the affected spine; or when the pain has subsided, use a poultice of herbs.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Apply this several times a day until the heat of the apostema subsides. Then place over it one of the emplasters that soothe, draw out, and tighten, and secure it with a bandage; and especially instruct the patient to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	He should not sleep over the affected part until the pain has subsided.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If this occurs near the friction of a broken bone, or something that has already separated from it: then one should, as it were, cut through the skin and remove that part.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then close the two edges of the wound together with stitches if it is large.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with some medicinal ointment until it heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If indeed the last part of a bone breaks and it is at the end of a limb: then one should, with the thumb of the left hand, insert into the opening, and with the other hand, equalize the broken bone as best as possible.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place something over it and remove the part that was removed: and care for the wound with the cure that preceded, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	§ On the restoration of an anchor.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the anchor rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then their fracture is not, except for a comminution at the extremities; and they split along their length, and bend towards the interior, and there occurs pain in the affected area and a puncture, and the leg that breaks becomes stunned.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is such that you extend your hand over it until you rest on the fracture as it is shown in the figure.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at the extremities, then equalize that fracture according to what is prepared for you from the equation until its natural shape is assimilated.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	However, if the fracture is along its length, or it has already bent towards the interior, then make the affected person lie on their side until a restoration for that fracture is prepared.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have equalized it, place a plaster over it, then place a frame made of wood or skin on top of it, and tighten the bandage above it so that you do not fear any change in the fracture, nor the removal of the frame.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And it should be equalized with what fills it, until the bandage takes hold according to its equality; and especially instruct the affected person to sleep on their back or their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	However, if there occurs a hot apthous ulcer: then stop the extension and restoration of it until the hot apthous ulcer is seated; and place over it what sits on it according to what has been said previously, then return to its restoration, and tighten it as appropriate.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If a fracture occurs in a bone, or it is broken, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	**On the Restoration of Fractures (with the Aid of God)**
Caput XII.	**Head (Chapter) XII.**
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	That aid is between the elbow and the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it (the aid) is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	Of these two, one is that you take a flat wood of medium thickness, according to this form that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligaments are bound at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from the elevated position, and the weak (part) sits on a support.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he projects his broken arm over the wood until it reaches its (the wood's) thickness, where a curvature of the wood is attached in the middle.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then he suspends something heavy from above, so that the helping hand extends down below.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician should reduce the fracture with his hands until it is healed as it ought to be.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	There is another method to raise the patient onto his own head: and suspend his hand from his neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants to hold one of them above the fracture with his hands, and let the other hold it below, extending each to their own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish for a stronger extension, then tie below the fracture with one bandage and above it with another, and each of the two assistants should extend to their respective sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the end of the humerus, then it is necessary to place one bandage below the joint and another below the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary to place a bandage over that place and above the very elbow.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then equalize the fracture with ease without strain until it is healed as it ought to be and applied properly: then tie it if there is no risk of fever.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If indeed there is a fever, then release the bandage until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place over it a linen cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the wound rests; then bind it, and the manner of binding it is such that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then bind the arm over itself, and place his open hand upon his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and bind the arm over itself, so that the arm remains in its place as if it were the stars; if nothing prevents you from doing this, or something does not disturb it above the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	If, however, anything hinders you from doing this, or something disturbs it above the broken bone, then use supports; and these are such that you place over the fracture itself a support which is broader and stronger than the others.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every support the breadth of a finger; and the length of the supports according to the fracture, with the addition of three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the supports the tightening as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is such that your tightening over the place of the fracture is tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more a fracture is elongated, the less is the contraction.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the position of the stars and the contraction, as we said, at the hour when you restore the member immediately, then do this: and if you fear a hot apposition, then release the contraction and let the stars remain until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligature for all three days, so that there is no itching, or swelling, or prevention of food reaching the member due to the excess contraction.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore correct that whole thing according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you have great confidence that nothing will happen from it: then do not release the ligature, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the nurse lie on her back, and her hand on her stomach: and place under her a pillow filled with equal wool.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of the night or day, so that the form of the broken member is not released, or the ligature becomes soft.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore correct that whole thing with your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place food for the patient according to the order we have mentioned, so that it is a subtle food at first, until the mouth begins to tighten; then it is necessary to make the food larger.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the purpose of aiding and strengthening the leg, it should be tightened for forty days; therefore, it is necessary to loosen it, apply a bath, and treat it with ointments that correct the condition.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is severe and dislocated, do not release the ligature from it and do not reduce it until after fifty days, that is, until two months have passed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	**On the Restoration of a Fractured Arm**
Caput XIII.	**Head XIII.**
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, called the humerus and the radius.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is smaller: and it follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is larger, and it is that which is placed under the smaller one at the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Therefore, perhaps only the larger bone is broken, or perhaps only the smaller one; and perhaps both are broken at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the upper part of the parenchyma is ruptured, its restoration is easy and its healing is more so.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the lower part of the parenchyma is ruptured, it is a severe fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones are broken at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is broken is a lower parenchyma, then it is fitting for the physician, in its restoration, to apply an extension of the part with ease, until it recovers on its own.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed the large parenchyma is that which is broken: then it is necessary to apply a stronger constriction with force.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to apply the hand's form in its restoration, and the extended extension above the pulse.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the other fingers; and the joints lower than all the other fingers, or remaining: and the weakened one sitting square on itself, and the pulse facing it, or straight in front of it, at an altitude so as not to incur weak labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the assistant should extend the arm from its lower part, or with their own hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another assistant should spread it similarly above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the surgeon should adjust the opening, until it reduces to a form more suitable according to his ability.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are jagged edges in the fracture of a bone, then try to reduce all the fragment to its place by your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed it appears separated with a jagged edge that pierces the skin and you have no hope of restoring it: then find above it and remove it according to the manner we have mentioned regarding those things that have been preceded.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	However, if the fracture is with a wound, I have already dealt with that particular chapter, so take care of it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If, during the beginning of your restoration, a fever occurs, then prepare a cloth with rose-colored oil and white wax, in the middle between thickness and thinness: and wrap the cloth tightly over it until the swelling is subsided; then remove the wax and apply a prepared plaster from ground meal with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place the staples, and let the staple that is placed over the fracture be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of staples in various dispositions is six; either there is a fracture in one groove or in two grooves at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage over the stronger and more firm part of the fracture, and a little higher or lower than the site of the fracture, or place a softer bandage over it for a short time, as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture should be soft, wet cloths and not hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And the thread used to tie it should be made of linen, of medium thickness between fine and coarse, as we have mentioned.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens that requires correction, such as a itching sensation in the member: then it is necessary to immerse the member in warm water until the itching subsides, and release the tight bandage until it is relieved, then repeat the bandaging.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage has already become softer, and the bone has already been removed, and similar things have occurred: then correct it all with your strength, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if the nourishment is blocked from reaching the member due to excess bandaging, then it is necessary to soften it a little for some time, and release it for a few days until it receives its nourishment, then tighten it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If, however, nothing of what we have said happens to the patient, then it is not necessary for it to be resolved after twenty days or so.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the patient should be suspended over his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And his neck should be steady, and held firm against agitated movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture will heal in thirty days, or perhaps in thirty-two days, and possibly even earlier, within twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this is according to the arrangements of the humors and the dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	## On the Healing of Fractures of the Hand
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that a fracture of the hand's joints or the rare separation of the fingers' knots happens.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him unless there has been friction many times.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore there occurs a fracture or contusion of the plantar part, then it is necessary that the patient be seated with his leg raised and in a position parallel to the ground.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand over it, extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant should extend the broken bones and adjust them until they are healed properly.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary for him to apply a plaster and bandage, unless there is a risk of a hot ulcer.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a splint over it according to the amount of space needed, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	However, if the fracture is around the lower part of the foot, then make a sphere-like shape out of cloth and especially instruct the patient to wrap it with his own fractured foot, then tie it tightly with a long piece of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And the splint should be made from skin, which has flexibility so that it can be applied with the skin of the foot, and tighten it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	However, if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary to place a splint above and another below the foot, and keep the hand open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then he applies a bandage as required by the hand, and extends it between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If any of the joints of the fingers should break, then if it is the thumb, it should be set as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it is bound with the foot, and if necessary, a splint should be placed straight and firm so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	However, if the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, index, ring, or little finger, then it should be set and bound with the healthy finger that follows it, or all of them according to their position, and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a firm splint on top of it as we said regarding the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your recovery, and after this arrangement of the heat treatment, oppose it as necessary when something happens from it, according to the course of its narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	## On the Recovery of Hip Fractures.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hipbone often breaks, and this is perceived by the senses because it turns towards the inside and rear part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is such that one ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the patient lies stretched out on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he stretches every supporting ligament to its own side according to equal measure; and this is when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	However, if the fracture is near the root of the hip, then one ligament should be pulled towards the pelvis so that the extension goes upwards; and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly, if there is a fracture near the knee, then the ligament close to the knee should be adjusted so that the extension goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the surgeon aligns the bone with both hands until it is reduced to its natural form; and the bone is joined together with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you apply a plaster and tighten it, if there is no loss of member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If there is such a loss: then leave it for a few days until the wound becomes heated (or infected), after which resume your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage should be adjusted as follows:
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	You must cover the hard fracture with a bandage; you should wrap it twice or three times and leave excess.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then bandage the leg until you reach the heel near the root of the toe.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee towards the lower parts, so that the ends of the thread come out from the upper part of both parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll up the excess from over the leg and hip.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place over the hip at the site of the fracture stars, and from them make one star on top of the leg bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the space between the leg and hip with soft cloth to ensure tightness.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with strong bandaging from the middle over the site of the fracture using three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more it is elongated with the ligament from the site of the fracture, the tighter and softer your bandage will be, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then turn towards the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore, tie it with both of the three stars that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then insert with both ends of the thread to the lower parts, until you reach the root of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And tie both strings, too, at the ends of the stars from the other side, so that the ligature does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then leave the ligature over that, as long as it remains, so that there is no corruption, nor ulceration, nor swelling, or similar things to them.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something of that happens.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, with the removal of that, and straightening what happened from it, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If there is indeed a fragment of bone that pierces through the bone, then you should, if possible, remove it completely.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find it above and remove it, and take care of him who preceded in the remembrance until he is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is constrained, besides adding stars to it as we said in the aid and in the arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of such a severely broken limb, it does not cause the patient to limp.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	But if it is restored alone, apart from applying another crutch, then it is necessary for the one whose leg it is, to limp forever.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is tightened for fifty days, or added slightly, or reduced slightly; all of this depends on the diversity of complexions and the remaining dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	**On the restoration of a broken knee joint.**
Caput XVI.	**Head XVI.**
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that the breaking of the knee joint rarely occurs, but it does experience friction many times.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed it experiences a break, then not only is there a crack, but also a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is that, with or without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands over that whole with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that it should be adjusted what has been disrupted from its parts with the fingers, until it is gathered and joined according to what is possible from balance and ease, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then apply a plaster made of sesame flour or from a mill, mixed with egg white; and place over it a round pad if necessary, and tighten a corresponding ligature above it.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements which we have described for the rest of the fractures, such as a hot apposition and similar ones, so that you oppose to every occurrence what is appropriate for it until healing takes place.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	§ On the restoration of a fracture of the thigh.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the thighs are two bones, of which one is thick and is called the thigh bone, and the other is thin and is called the femur.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens that both kinds of fractures occur in each of the bones of the thigh, and because of this their restoration is done like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones break simultaneously, the thigh turns into an invalid, affecting all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thinner bone breaks, the thigh turns into an invalid towards the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone breaks, you will find it below, and they are among those that will not be hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then he administers the extension, equalization, and ligation of the stars according to that equality.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a severe one, having many pieces, then there should be less extension and a gentler relief in your treatment.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And indeed, in the leg, there is something like a lever on the thigh, and it is just as when you equalize the stars and complete all your work, then take two strips of pine wood, which are used in making sun dials that are placed under tables: they are made from the palm of a hand, and choose those with a moderate thickness, not too small, and their length should be according to the length of the leg from the knee down.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each cloth with two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other part on the other side, so that they extend from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two strips at three places from both ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when the tightness is forbidden, the leg bends to the right and left, and stands steadily in place.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed, a cradle should be made of wood according to the length of the leg, and the leg placed in it so that it preserves itself from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed, it is most necessary that you do this in a fracture when there is a proper wound therein.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the wound every day, and study with it with utmost diligence, from ulceration, or swelling, or any other conditions.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore something happens from these, then oppose it with what is necessary until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	On the fracture of bones of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Head XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A calcaneal fracture does not occur completely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	To the bones of the foot indeed occurs a fracture, and to the toes a fracture occurs rarely: and it does not occur to them unless there is friction in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs, and you see these bones rising up above each other again, then the patient should put his foot on prepared ground as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand up, and put your foot on whatever raises these bones; then press, or tread on it; and equalize it, until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a plaster and a poultice on top of it. Place a thin board under the sole of the foot, which has two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it tightly with the foot wrapped neatly, after you have covered it with linen and other things it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	So, when they have passed three or four days, then untie the ligature.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For when you find the bones are either equal [in length], or broken, or out of joint.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Therefore, the operation on them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	However, if some of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them equal according to what I have told you about restoring the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger as an asterisk according to the length of the finger, and make it a little wider; then place this board under the foot, which I have told you about, and tie it neatly with a strap.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If indeed it is that two, three, or more bones are broken, then place over every finger an asterisk of its amount, wrapped in linen cloth; and tie the board to the lower part of the foot, and let it stand on one end of the table's cap outside the foot's vent, so as to hold good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it comes to pass that you do not forget, but consider all that I have told you about the other fractures from accidents that we mentioned, and oppose every accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	On the fracture of the woman's vulva, the ribs, and the man's penis.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit with her legs apart.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her slightly towards the back part of her own body, and hold her rearward.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife should fill her vulva with cotton until it is full, and let it be like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then the woman should be made to cough, and slowly raise her back.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	That cotton will emerge, until the vulva is made to look like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a small piece of cloth on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she feels the need to defecate, remove the cloth with ease, then let her do her business, and bring it out according to the manner in which you first inserted it; then return to her original position.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	He should do that in seven days, or approximately, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if it is still alive, take a wax-covered thread and tie it tightly over the opening of its wound, and insert the entire needle into its flesh.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the needle with strength until the thread straightens inside the flesh; for indeed, the fracture is healed.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it is wrapped with cloth and left for several days, as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when a man's chest bone, or a woman's, is broken, then apply for its restoration, and use the same method we have described for the bone of the anchor.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And let the straightening of these close fractures not be hidden from one who is learned or skilled.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for the fracture itself shows you the way to a straight path in restoring and tightening it. Therefore, understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when a man's staff is broken, take the neck of a goose, and insert the staff into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place a poultice on top of it and leave it to absorb for three or four days, and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	On the restoration of a bone fracture when it is accompanied by a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is advisable for anyone who experiences a fracture with a wound, especially if it is a large bone such as the hipbone or the femur or similar bones, to immediately seek help from phlebotomists. If you are familiar with the procedures of phlebotomy, as we have mentioned, then follow these steps:
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound bleeds, then it is necessary to have someone cut it open, so that the pus accumulated on top of it can be drained; if you do not have another option.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on the same day; do not delay it unless there is no risk of complications.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed there is a fever, then postpone the restoration of the fracture until the ninth day, unless the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, lest you cause it to take a turn for the worse.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If, however, a broken bone protrudes above the skin, you must then strive to reduce it and equalize it with your hands easily and with slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, sufficient extension cannot be prepared and the bone cannot be equalized with your hands, then reduce it using this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is an instrument made of iron that is seven or eight fingers in length and as wide as the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for that reason, the physician must take three or four of them, according to the amount needed from each kind of treatment in every type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be round, and have a slight thickness so that it does not double up at the time of compression during surgery, and its ends should be sharp with a margin at their extremes.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And it should be, from the middle of its thickness up to its lower part, in a slanting manner.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, it is necessary to place the sharp end against the prominent extremity of the bone, and push it with one blow until the bone returns and is equalized by itself.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, strive to equalize and align the ends of the fracture.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If the ends of the fracture are fine and do not accept the instrument well, then it is necessary to cut the end of the bone with a chisel until the instrument has a firm grip.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If you cannot reduce them at all with what we have mentioned, then cut it with the instrument that is suitable for cutting, as we have said; or saw it with any saw that is possible for you to use.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then smooth the remaining part that is on the bone, due to its roughness and fine chips.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone is reduced and experiences a sudden severe pain after its reduction, then you should know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
Fac ergo illud.	Do that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	Indeed, you provide great assistance to the weak when your restoration of the bone is complete.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in black, astringent wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And use it appropriately in the summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place any yellow substance over a wound, nor anything that contains oil, so as not to cause putrefaction and corruption within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer stars at the appropriate time for the restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound exposed: so that you may cut with scissors a hole into the inflammation according to the amount of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take every care not to strain the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Many times foolish doctors have done this: and they have caused harm to their patients or death, or putrefaction, or gangrene, that is, loss of blood.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your traction be soft, pliable, unlike the hard tractions of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad or large, and there is some bad event as we described, and you feel pain at the suspended place, then it is not necessary to put stars over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make incisions on them with hard bands at the place of the stars, and tie them tightly to it.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	However, if it has been one day or two, and you see that the wound is beginning to form pus, then remove the cloth you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply poultices and ointments that we usually use to treat wounds, such as the four-ingredient ointment and others like it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it often happens that you need to loosen the ligature.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day at morning and evening, until it hardens and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the member be prepared so that pus can drain from it easily downward.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days have passed since the wound, and it does not harden nor does pus drain from it, then know that there are seriously small bones there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore, it is necessary that you examine the wound with care.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	Indeed, as many of those small bones become separated, remove them, and extract the entire one.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those which are not separated from the others and pierce the member, causing pain, try to cut them off, and remove them in every way possible for you to do so.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If a wound becomes infected or gangrenous, or any other form of corruption and putrefaction arises, then it is necessary to oppose each of these with what is appropriate for its cure, which has been previously described in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from this, where it is necessary for my speech to stand firm, and when you make your present mind when a bone breaks and protrudes beyond the member, such as the hip joint, and similar parts of large members, do not presume its attraction, for often death results from it, indeed, let go of it until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will disappear of itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Therefore, cure the wound if it seems suitable to you, otherwise, let it be.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	**On the Cure of the Nodule at the Site of a Fracture.**
Caput XXI.	**Chapter XXI.**
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This nodule often occurs at the site of healing a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, when it occurs near joints, and it corrupts the form of the member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it may prohibit the member from its natural operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, at that time, if the swelling is recent, administer medications that have a drying effect, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar substances.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So, take some of these, or all of them, and mix them with astringent wine, or with albumen, or with vinegar, and apply them to the swelling in a poultice, and bind them tightly over the affected area.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And do not remove the bandage for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another one, until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind a sheet of lead tightly over it.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead, indeed, has the property of drawing out whatever is feared from the member.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If however the swelling has already turned into a stone, and it is hard and tight, and urgent need requires its removal: then find a way to remove it from its upper part, and cut off the protruding excess; or rasp it off with rasors until it is removed, and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	On healing when a member is restored and remains after that in a subtle state, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	**Chapter XXII**
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fracture of a bone is restored and the member remains after that in a subtle, weak state, then it does not become healed except because of many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of these is the excessive solution and binding of the ligament, not according to what is needed; either because of an excess of tightness in the ligaments, preventing nutrition from reaching the member; or because of too many applications at the wrong time; or due to a lack of blood in a weak body, and its debilitation.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment for this is to feed the weak patient and make his body strong, until blood increases in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place a poultice on the member, so that it attracts the poultice to itself, drawing much nutrition to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And he should continue to apply the hot water bath until nutrition flows and it returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the cure of fractured bones when they are healed in a twisted manner.
Caput XXIII.	**Chapter XXIII**
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When a member, having been already restored after its healing, presents itself in a twisted manner or with prominent fractured bones or some deformity, and because of this form the member is disfigured, yet it does not prevent the member from performing its natural functions; then it is not necessary to accept his claim, who considers that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And indeed, there have been many foolish doctors and healers who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed reprehensible, leading to death or a great fear, as it is mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	Indeed, if the twisting and deformity are recent: then it is necessary to immerse it in warm water with herbs that soften, such as almond leaves, and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let a plaster be made with a softening paste, such as a properly made poultice.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucus of the almond root, and mix it with chicken fat, or chickpea oil, and wrap it up with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	They may be enriched with fat-soluble figs and rubbed with columbine lard or other similar preparations that reduce scarring.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot is loosened by persistent friction, old and gentle, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And the movement of the limb should be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	However, if deformity has already occurred and it has become strong and hardened into a stone, and the need for treatment arises with a knife: then it is necessary to cut off its upper part and dissolve the continuity of the bone and cut away what exceeds from the knot or bone using delicate scissors: and ease should be provided in that place with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	**On the Discussion of Dislocation**
Caput XXIIII.	**Chapter XXIV**
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the separation of any joint from its position.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is forbidden from its own motion, and the figure of the limb is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes painful accidents and severe injuries to the weak.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When someone experiences a dislocation, it is necessary to hurry to restore it; nor should there be any delay at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if there is delay, the place should be changed, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	For this reason, it is not necessary for him to be moved, nor should he be extended in the time of his change of place.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it often causes spasms to occur, and painful troubles.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	Indeed, when that happens, then it is necessary to prepare for bloodletting by the nurse.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then he is released until the dislocation has healed.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member is bathed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it is reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And all the members should be treated as soon as the memory of their condition returns to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already outlined the chapters on dislocations, even according to what has come before in the fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower parts.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	On the treatment of mandible dislocation.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two mandibles rarely dislocate unless, occasionally, they do.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both [mandibles] occurs according to one of two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are indeed removed from their places by a slight dislocation, and they become soft for a little while.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they may dislocate completely and entirely, until they become soft towards the chest, until the saliva is released, and it cannot hold itself firm, nor can it close its own jaw, and its tongue is drawn in with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When, however, the dislocation is slight, then it returns to many positions on its own with little effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If it is indeed a complete, entire dislocation: then it is necessary that its reduction be done quickly, and not delayed thoroughly: and it is as if it should hold the minister's finger below the chin: and the physician should insert one of his hands into the root of the mandible dislocation between the jaw and the tooth, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	If a dislocation occurs in both parts, he should insert both his thumbs simultaneously.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the rest of his hand's fingers should be outside as he requires.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And especially instruct the patient to clean his jaws, and bring them back to normal for chewing on both sides.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor should adjust the jaw, and gently push it back to its normal position until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are involved simultaneously, then apply a hot water and oil poultice until the reduction becomes easy; never delay reducing the jaws altogether, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they return and align, and the patient's mouth is closed, and they do not open: then place small cloth poultices on them, coated with a paste made from beeswax and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it should be tied gently with soft ligatures.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And the patient should sleep on his back, with his head elevated between two pillows to prevent him from moving it to the right or left, and he should not try to chew anything or even think about chewing; instead, a soft liquid diet should be provided until the pain subsides and the jaw is flexible. Then he may eat what he likes and swallow it easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	It should not be difficult to perform surgery on one's own mouth while eating and drinking, and chewing, until the jawbone is detached and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jawbones becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some point and do not return to their places, then often fever occurs from there, and persistent vomiting; and perhaps the internal organs are damaged, and perhaps pure cholera is expelled.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	So if you see that (the condition) becomes like this, then know that it is a loss, and often he who experiences that dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	**On the Reduction of Shoulder Dislocation and the End of the Humerus**
Caput XXVI.	**Head XVI.**
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The shoulder blade (furcula) does not dislocate inwardly from its inner side due to its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it (the shoulder blade) dislocates outward sometimes, and that is indicated to the senses.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the sick person lies on his back and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then it (the shoulder blade) shortens the space with your strong contraction of the hand, for it will return on its own.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a plaster, and some wool, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities indeed, which follow the cubitus, and continue with it, are not dislocated unless rarely so.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it becomes dislocated at any time, then it must be reduced and set in the position that we have said, and what you have prepared.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a plaster, and some wool, and bind it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And especially instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with the same treatment, the end of the arm is reduced when it has been separated from its place as well.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	## On the Reduction of Shoulder Dislocation
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the shoulder (Humerus) is not dislocated unless according to three modes.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	Of which one is that it becomes dislocated towards the lower part of the side (titillicus).
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second [method] is to dislocate it towards a part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it will dislocate towards the upper part of the humerus, and that becomes rare.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not dislocate towards the rear, because of the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not dislocate towards the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And indeed, it dislocates and emerges most towards the lower part of the thigh, especially in those whose flesh is scarce.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it emerges swiftly in those [parts], and enters swiftly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	However, in those whose flesh is abundant, the opposite occurs; that is, it emerges with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men through a blow or accident, and the humerus is dislocated at the joint with heat, and one thinks that's because it's already dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, one must experience that, until you are certain of it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And a dislocation is known when it affects the lower joints; and you distinguish between the dislocated humerus and the healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you perceive a clear difference between them, and you notice a weakness in the head of the humerus, and near the joint, the head of the humerus feels as if it is another bone; and the infirm person cannot bring their hand back to its own side, nor move it through all its motions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if the joint of the chest or the upper part is dislocated, then you will notice a clear sensation, and it will not be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed, this dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent or if the patient is a young child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is such that it lifts the patient's hand towards the upper part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under the joint and lift the connection with strength towards its proper place; and the patient will raise their hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then place it downwards; for indeed it returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If, however, it does not return as we said, and there have been many days since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and an application made which softens and relaxes, such as when roots of high quality, fennel, or melilot are steeped in water and applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Next, the patient should be placed face up on his back, and under his armpit is placed a sphere and wool that are equal between relaxation and tension.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should place his heel on the sphere and raise the head of the humerus with force, and pull the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another attendant should hold the patient's head to prevent it from moving downwards; for he himself will immediately return.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if he struggles, bring him back in this manner: and it is as if you make the present man who is stronger than the patient, and stands on his side, and inserts his elbow under the patient's armpit; then lift the armpit towards the upper part until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another attendant should pull the patient's hand towards the lower part of his chest.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If however the patient is weak, then something else should be suspended with him in order to make him heavier; for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is brought down in another manner as well; and a long wooden beam should be fixed in the ground, whose head is round like the handle of a mortar; not too thick nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then a cloth should be placed under the patient after it is laid over his head, and the patient should stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then he should extend his hand towards the lower part on the other side, and extend his body from the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this care: and it is as if you take a wood whose length is the amount of two arms, and its width is the amount of four fingers, and its thickness is the amount of two fingers; which has a round head to facilitate its entry into the deep part of the wound, in this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then cloth should be laid over the round head so as not to harm the wooden patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place the patient under the wound, so that he extends his hand or arm over the wood until below; and bind the wood over the helper and the arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm over the step according to its width, and extend the hand below, and let go of the remaining body suspended on the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The joint enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	Thus, when the opening is completed in any way that is possible, it is then necessary to place beneath it a sphere of an equal amount made from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then apply the prepared plaster from ground wool mixed with myrrh and egg white over the entire upper arm as required.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tighten the bandage properly; and the ligament is wrapped over the plaster above; and the hand is attached to the neck and released, so that the hand does not move for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to give light food to the weak patient until the member is strengthened, for this aids its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger bandage is applied after seven or five days, and it is removed with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it is firmly established and does not relax, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the dislocation occurs repeatedly due to moisture or for another reason, then cautery with three incisions should be administered according to what is mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not secured, and the plaster and bandage are removed several times, but do not become firm, and fall off, and cannot raise itself up to its original position; then know that the nerves of the shoulder have been cut, or stretched, or relaxed; and know that the joint will never be restored to its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	However, when dislocation occurs against the chest and breast, or when it is reduced to the rear, this is done with a push and extension using the hands; until it returns, and the remaining tension and care are administered, until healing occurs.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If, after healing, a severe condition occurs in the member and there is delay in its motion, then the patient should use baths frequently until that severity is alleviated and it returns to its original natural state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	**On the healing of elbow dislocation.**
Caput XXVIII.	**Chapter XXVIII.**
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the elbow joint can become dislocated with difficulty, and likewise, it returns to its place with difficulty; indeed, it dislocates towards all parts, particularly to the front or rear.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it falls under pressure and touch, according to whatever form it takes.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, that becomes clearly evident.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The joint is then secured, and the arm cannot be doubled or touched with its own humerus.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you move towards reducing the dislocation immediately, before a hot apoplessia occurs to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot apoplessia occurs to it, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it will not be cured at all, especially when it affects the posterior parts.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	It is indeed the worst of all types of dislocations, and causes more severe pain; and often leads to death with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration when it is possible to reduce it is, as he extends his hand with both hands: and his arm is expanded, and the doctor's hand is above his elbow and under it, and he pushes the joint with his thumbs simultaneously, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or if the dislocation is to the front, then it returns so that he doubles his hand with his own hand, until he strikes the elbow which is dislocated with the root of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not obey to be reduced, then apply a strong, steady extension; and it is as if both arms of the assistants are extended: and even two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is moved to all parts after it has been covered with a doubled cloth or a wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should grease it with oil so that it becomes from those things that aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should push the joint with a firm impulse until it returns to its place.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary to place a plaster on top of it, which has a constricting and drying effect with alum, and the tightness should be adjusted appropriately.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be suspended from the neck of the patient, and leave it for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is removed.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint is fixed in its place, then loosen the ligature from it and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the joint is not tightly bound, then repeat the plaster and ligature, and leave it for several days until it tightens.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then remove it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	However, if there is a serious problem after the reduction of the joint and its position is in motion, then apply moisture to the bath, and light friction, and compression until it is lined or place a hot compress on the affected joint, that is, a pinged arrow poultice.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it is bound, and left upon her day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it and insert the same into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When, therefore, it is sweating, then fear joins friction with moderate pressure.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat over the same the application of the aloe once, and twice, and three times with the entrance into the bath, until it becomes soft.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if it is necessary, place upon it a hot, moist, greasy compress and tighten it over the same.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	It becomes soft and returns to its original position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	§ On the treatment of dislocation according to Al-Mahashem.
Caput XXIX.	Head XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Al-Mahashem frequently dislocates the hand, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	In contrast, the remaining joints are connected.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of its dislocation at the time when it becomes dislocated, before the place leaves; or else a hot ulcer occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation is such that you place your weaker hand on the table and have the assistant stretch out his hand, and the doctor places his palm on top of the joint and pushes it until it returns to its place.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already retracted into the hand; then the patient should place the back of his hand on the table at the time of extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be such that the inner part of his hand is placed on the table, so that the doctor's hand can fall upon the very top of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster to prevent the ulcer from spreading, and release it, without repeating this.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not endure, nor can you reduce it further after the passage of days, but the joint remains according to its deformity, and it causes the patient no pain except that the hand becomes soft, and he cannot grasp anything; then know that the nerves are severed or rubbed raw.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is no skill in it other than to bind with a ligature near the case (wound).
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not contribute anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	If, therefore, it does not return as Almahassem described, then place an ointment (dressing) over it as we have mentioned.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it should be bound and left for five days; after that, it should be opened and left, and the hand (or wound) should be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If, however, its (the wound's) movement is restricted and something grave happens: then it should be relaxed with warm water and friction several times until it becomes relaxed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	**On the treatment of finger dislocation.**
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from its joint in any direction, towards the back of the hand or between its joints, then extend (the finger) and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns to its place.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the finger's head, and hang it towards the side where it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it and extend it until it becomes straight in its own time.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When evening comes, bind it according to that very description; and do not cease to loosen it during the day; and exercise it with motion; and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days until it is tightened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do likewise with it if it becomes dislocated at the wrist; bind it to that very part, and perform your first operation with it until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do likewise with it when it becomes dislocated at other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	**On the healing of spinal joint dislocation.**
Caput XXXI.	Head 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When anyone suffers from a complete dislocation of the spine or the vertebrae are removed from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death is approaching the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of it is that the sick person's strength departs without will, and he cannot hold it; and often some of its members become weak, or both legs, or both arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	Many times that which is removed happens to be separated from those parts four times.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed towards the rear is called gibbousness.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The treatment of it is that you consider at that time if gibbousness occurs from childhood: then there is no cure for it, nor is there any recovery from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	For those that occur due to accident or impact, or similar causes, the ancient methods of treatment have been discussed at length.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Much of it does not return with success.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I will now briefly depart from that topic, which requires little excuse given its proximity to my intent; and with the exposition I have provided regarding it, and the various ways in which the instrument was shaped, as well as the demonstration of itself, and its application.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore, I say that in the gibbousness that occurs from the anterior part, there is no skill, nor is there recovery from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly, for that which occurs on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not treated from them, unless what happens in his own back, because of what I am telling: and it is as if the sick is extended over his face on an equal level with the floor near the wall, and a humid cloth is spread under him, so that his chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight board is placed fixed in the fire on the floor at the foot of his head and another board around his feet at the other end of the foot, and the attendant holds the board, and it is not fastened in the fire.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another attendant holds the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then he wraps over the head of the sick person a soft cloth, and fastens it under his armpits firmly, and extends the end of the cloth to the board that is near his head, and ties him to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then he tightens another cloth over his thighs, and above his knees, and near his feet.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then he combines all the cloths, and ties them to the other board that is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then all the attendants stretch out towards the part of the board with the cloths, and do not move the two boards from their places where they are fixed; however, they are not fastened, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician should place his palms on the spine with strength until it returns, or place a board on top of it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he attaches his feet over the board until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms' breadth.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And he should choose the place on the wall, as we said, that is near the weak point, where the end of the board will enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And the physician should place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And he should tie it well until the spine is tightened, and return to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then, if you wish, use a drill that is inserted with your hand: and it is as if you fix two wooden sticks in the ground near the head of the weak foot, whose length is one arm's breadth, and two more near its head.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length between all the sticks is one palm; and now a hole has been made at every place where the drill runs: and every stick is firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And a round stick should be inserted; and it is a turn in which the ligament is revolved through two holes of the two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it there is a hole, in which the stick is fixed, whose length is a palm with which it revolves; and similarly in the other two sticks.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligaments which you have tightened in the lower chest around the lower turn which is near its head, and the ligaments which you have tightened in its legs around the turn which is near its feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand beside each turn that moves the hand with a tie, with which the turn revolves; and the physician adjusts the spine, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turn that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the spine returns and the place is adjusted, then you should put a dry plaster with alum and eggwhite.
Deinde stuppam.	Then apply the poultice.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards, place above the plaster a star-shaped pad from wood, whose width is three fingers, or approximately those dimensions.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the amount that takes up the space of the hernia, and beyond the healthy part of the spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is tied with the ligament that we have mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And it should be nourished with delicate food until it is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If there remains something of prominence in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that remedies that soften and relax be administered, along with the application of a poultice as we described in detail during a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a sheet of lead is administered in that place.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes there occurs a prominence in the final part of the spine, and it is thought to be due to dislocation, and that bone which already protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not necessary to make such an assumption with this medicine; perhaps indeed it will cause death to occur.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	## On the Treatment of a Dislocated Ankle
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that the ankle and shoulder joints do not become dislocated except due to displacement alone; nor does it happen to them what happens to other joints from a slight removal and pressure.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	Indeed, the joint of the anchor is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	This is because it is dislocated towards the front and back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And it is most dislocated towards the interior, and slightly dislocated towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment for the dislocation towards the interior is as follows: because when you join the healthy leg to the injured one, it is longer; and the knee of the injured leg stands higher than that of the healthy one, and the injured person cannot bend their foot at the groin; and there is a place that follows the groin after the limb is straightened due to heat, because the head of the thigh has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of one who experiences a dislocation towards the exterior is that it is contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of one who experiences a dislocation towards the front is that they stretch their healthy leg to its limit; however, they cannot bend it without pain in the knee; and if they try to walk, they cannot go beyond this point; and they retain urine, and their groin becomes stiff, and during walking, they place weight on their heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of one who experiences a dislocation towards the back is that they do not stretch their leg, and cannot bend it until their groin doubles in size; and their leg is also shorter on the affected side; and the groin is relaxed, and the head of the thigh is at the location mentioned.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this type of dislocation is such that you must consider it at that time, if the dislocation is old and has become worn with the passage of time.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you perform the reduction of it and it remains according to its own arrangement, then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it is not necessary for a complete assumption to be made about it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	However, in the case of a recent dislocation, which belongs to one of the four types of dislocations, you should act appropriately to restore the joint, and stretch it towards the interior and exterior, and move it with your right and left hand: perhaps it will return on its own and no other treatment will be needed.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If, however, it does not return in this way, then you should prepare a strong helper, and stretch the leg from its lower part: either with their hands or with a bandage that is tied above the knee: and another assistant extends their hand from above, so as to insert their hands beneath his armpits.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then, tie a loose bandage over the root of the thigh, and hold the end of the other bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And the extension should be either from the front part of the groin to the part of the femur, or from the back part to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let their extension be with one motion until the patient is lifted from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this kind of extension is the common type among the four kinds of species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we said, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary for each kind to use that which I will say about its own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of it, indeed, when the dislocation affects internal parts, it is necessary that the patient be placed on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should place the ligament over the root of the hip, where it is between the hip joint and the space under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin area towards the higher part of the body, towards the part of the fork (of the hip bone).
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then have another assistant take the patient's strong arm and narrow the large space of the weak hip joint, and extend it with a steady motion towards the external extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For I return it to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is the easiest among the rest of the cure kinds, through which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If, however, it turns away from you and does not obey you for entry with this type of treatment at all, then it is necessary that both weak feet be bound simultaneously with a strong ligature, loose over the two calcaneuses and over the two knees; and the length of each one should be from its own comparison to the quantity of four fingers; and the weak leg should be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the weak one should be suspended over the head of the log, which is in the house; and its length from the ground should be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command the strong young one to strengthen the head of the thigh; and hang another weak one with the strong one; and push the strong one, strengthening the thigh with force, for the connection returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In its return, however, when the dislocation goes to the outside, it is necessary that the weak one lies on a bed, according to what we have mentioned in the case of hunchback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And the ligature should be tied over its weak leg, properly, and also over its chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two logs should be placed, one at his feet and another at the head of him.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then the additional log should be placed in the middle of the foot, fixed well; over which wet cloths should be laid to not harm the weak one; and the log should be between his thighs so as not to be pulled down towards the lower part during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then each instrument should be extended to its own part, and the surgeon should equalize the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it obeys the return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place a board over it and press it equally, as we said regarding the hump.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary for the sick person to lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary to quickly extend the sick person's leg, and according to this same description on the bed: and the surgeon should place his right hand's palm over the sick person's inguinal area.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then it tightens itself with the other hand, and with that tightening, place the extended hip towards the lower part of the leg.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is towards the back, then it is not necessary for the sick person to be extended downwards and lifted up, but rather he should be placed on a hard surface, as it is also done when the wide dislocation is towards the exterior, according to what we said about his position on two surfaces: and it lies on its face, with its ligaments extended, according to what we just said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that a compression be administered with a board over the place to which the operation extends, when the reduction is completed according as it should be.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And you must not overlook the sign of its return: and it is as if you stretch out the two weak legs; and when you see that they are equal, and the weak one tightens its leg and expands itself without straining, then you know that the member has returned according to what was needed; then join the two thighs, and apply a plaster, and bind with a bandage, so as not to move widely to any part, and let the patient adhere to rest for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligature, and remove the plaster, and compare the leg with the other; and when you see that they are equal in position, then you know that the dislocation is now fixed. Therefore release the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any sign of softening: then return, and apply that plaster, and bind it according to your first tightening, and release it after three days as well.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make the healing take place slowly in walking on each for several days until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	§ On the dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee dislocates in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It dislocates outwardly, inwardly, and downward, that is, to the rear.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it does not dislocate toward the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that it causes the patient to bend their leg towards their chest.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If, however, it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all three kinds of dislocation is to make the patient sit upright, so that they can extend their leg as much as possible towards it and attach the back of their thigh to the front of yours; and place their foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make the knee adhere to your palms, and place them straight between your fingers above the knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply your palm to both sides of the knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And have another assistant stretch their leg until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of healing is that the foot adheres to the thigh gently, not painfully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply a hot poultice, and make the foot adhere to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with bandages for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the invalid should not walk for several days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, you do not achieve the return of the limb, then administer a strong extension with ligatures, whose method was previously described in the treatment of the ankle, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	**On the treatment of calcaneal dislocation**
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIIIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The calcaneus is sometimes removed by a slight displacement, and sometimes it is dislocated in its full range.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either towards the interior or towards the exterior.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you will see the calcaneum (heel bone) inflated, extending towards the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	However, the treatment for its reduction is easy: it should be extended with ease using the hands and then adjusted until it returns to its proper place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	However, in its treatment when it is dislocated towards the second position, you should make the infirm sit upright, and have a strong assistant hold them firmly from the rear part of their back, in the middle.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold the foot with your right hand from its upper part, and with your left hand from its lower part, at the level of the toe joint.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with your left hand, using two fingers.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend your left hand and push the sole of the foot with your right hand towards the shin without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the sole of the foot towards the shin in the third position, and pull the toe joint.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If it returns to its original state once or twice in this manner and you see the foot is even, that is good. If not, then repeat the operation on it, for it recovers.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	However, if you are prevented from reducing it in the manner described, then lay the patient down on his back on the ground and fix a very firm pillow on the ground between his thighs so that he falls into a comfortable position; and you have already covered him with a cloth to avoid hurting him.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then the assistant should take hold of the patient's thigh; afterwards, another assistant extends the leg, either with their hands or using a bandage that is tied around the collar of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then every assistant should extend it against the extension of his counterpart: and a pillow should stand between the two thighs of the patient, holding him in place so that his body does not tilt downwards during the stretch.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician should reduce the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant holds the healthy leg down towards the ground.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	The dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When the dislocation returns and its restoration is declared to you, then apply a plaster and bandage, tighten it firmly with bands, and tie the leg with a bandage to the shin bone.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you be careful or fear of the nerves that are above the rear ankle, so that no ligament over them prevails and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then allow it to rest for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament becomes relaxed, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day and forbid the disabled person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If indeed he tries to walk before that space is filled, there is no security unless the dislocation dissolves and heals, and it does not receive treatment afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If a fever occurs to him, then it is necessary that you administer to his sedative that we mentioned earlier in another place concerning treatment, and embrocation until the fever disappears.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	**On the Dislocation of the Toe Joints, and Treatment.**
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXIV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated from them with a slight extension without effort be corrected; and this is not difficult but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	However, if the dislocation is in any of the knots of the foot, then it is necessary that the disabled person sit on his foot over an equal place to the ground or on a board and stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then stand you, and place your foot upon that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it firmly with your foot until it returns to its original position, and you will see that the swelling has gone down and no longer appears prominent.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under the foot a board which will take the whole foot, having two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten this restriction for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and make it rest from walking for many days until it is tightened and secured by the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	§ On the kinds of dislocation with the ulna or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Head XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of this sort occurs and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often follows many times over: and for that reason one should not presume to undertake such care unless one is skilled in the art, merciful, pious, slow to act, not rash, nor presumptuous: and use only initial medicines which provide merely temporary relief from heat. And let the sick be committed to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you have hope, or expect salvation from destruction through the gentleness of illness, and where something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, try to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If therefore the member returns to its original state, according to what we wish, then administer treatment to soothe the abscess: and care for the wound with what is appropriate for it from dried ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If there is a dislocation with a fracture, and these occur in separated bones of the leg, then try to remove them, and do in that what we said about simple illnesses from what preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And be careful according to your strength, and guard yourself from the entrance of fear: as my previous prediction to you has said.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more beneficial to your body among them during your time.
