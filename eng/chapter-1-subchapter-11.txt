 CHAPTER ELEVEN.
On cauterization for melancholy.
 When the cause of the melancholy be corrupt humours and a thick phlegm, burn him with those cauterizations mentioned in the case of the paralytic.
If the cause of the melancholy be a redundance of humour turning to black bile, and the patient's body be humid, make him drink that which will purge his head as described in a previous section.
Then shave the patient's head and apply a compact ring-bandage of linen and put it round the middle of his head.
Have him sit cross-legged, held firmly on all sides.
Then take a pound of stale sheep's butter and warm it on the fire to a moderate heat so that a finger put in can bear it; then pour it out on the middle of the head inside the circle of the bandage and leave it till it has cooled.
Do this once a week with other efficacious treatment till he is cured.
If you wish, burn him with multiple small puncture cauterizations; nor press long on the cautery but let this cauterization be only just punctured.
For this kind of cauterization will moderately moisten the brain.
Then let cotton soaked in butter or hen's grease be applied.
