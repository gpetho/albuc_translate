When the afterbirth is retained at childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with pepper, and hold your hands over her mouth and nose; 
and if it comes out because of this, it is good.
If not, then take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the womb's opening, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, birthwort and centaury;
all these herbs, or some of them, should be cooked in a pot in water over the fire;
then put one end of a tube in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the opening of the womb, and hold it there so that the steam enters the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said.
The afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to wet her left hand in sesame oil or in marshmallow mucilage, and then put it in the vagina, and search for the afterbirth;
and when she has found it, she should take it and pull it little by little, straight out, so that the womb does not fall out during the extraction;
but she should move it gently to the right and to the left, and then pull;
thus it will come and be detached.
And if the opening of the womb is already narrowed, we have described the treatment of sneezing, and of fumigation with herbs;
and if it does not come out with all that we have said, be careful not to be foolish in pulling;
but what is at the opening of the womb, you must tie it to the woman's thigh, then administer an enema of tetrapharmacum ointment;
thus it will rot and soften, and come out;
however, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient.
So then suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
some of the ancients tried fumigation of watercress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is made of glass, similar to a cane, and one puts the narrow end in the genitals, and the wide end over the fire;
and let the fumigation be over the coals, and let it burn until it is used up, and start another one.
