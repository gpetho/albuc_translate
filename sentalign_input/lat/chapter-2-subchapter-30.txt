On the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
Chapter 30.
You must treat a painful tooth with every possible means and delay its extraction if possible.
Nothing truly substitutes for a tooth once it is extracted, as it is an exalted substance. Therefore, only when there is no alternative should extraction be considered. In that case, confirm thoroughly with the patient that the aching tooth itself is the one requiring extraction.
Often, pain can deceive the patient, who may mistakenly believe the pain is in a healthy tooth and has it extracted, only for the pain to persist until the actual diseased tooth is removed.
We have seen this occur frequently in the work of inexperienced phlebotomists.
Once you have confirmed the aching tooth, it is necessary to scarify around it with a pointed tool possessing adequate strength until the gum loosens completely. Then, gradually move the tooth with your fingers or with fine forceps until you sufficiently shake it.
Next, position large forceps correctly on the tooth, and place the patientâ€™s head firmly between your knees to hold it steady. Then, pull the tooth straight out to avoid breaking it.
If the tooth does not come out, take one of your tools and gently insert it beneath the tooth on all sides, moving it as you did initially.
If the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill the cavity with a piece of cloth, then secure it with the end of a thin rod to prevent it from breaking when you grip it with forceps.
Be diligent in scarifying around the gum on all sides.
Control your strength to avoid breaking the tooth and leaving part of it, which could result in complications worse than the initial pain.
Be cautious not to act like inexperienced phlebotomists, who in their haste and boldness during extractions, ignore the guidance we have provided.
For, as we have often observed, they cause patients serious harm, breaking the tooth and leaving its roots or even pulling part of the jawbone.
After extraction, rinse the site with wine or with vinegar and salt.
If bleeding occurs at the site (which often happens), grind some alum and apply it to the area. If alum is ineffective, cauterize it.
The fine forceps for initially loosening the tooth should have long ends and a short, thick handle, so they do not bend under pressure. The handles should be strong enough to avoid bending or folding when gripped. They should have short, straight ends made from high-quality iron or sturdy steel, with interlocking teeth at the tips for a firm, even grip.
Sometimes the ends are shaped like the beak of a bird called the stork, providing a very strong grip.
