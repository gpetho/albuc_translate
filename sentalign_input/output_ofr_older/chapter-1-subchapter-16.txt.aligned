of the hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the eyelashes turn inward and prick the eye, and cauteries are applied in two ways: either with fire or with burning medicine.	On cauterization of the eyelid when the eyelashes are turned inwards, irritating the eye. The cauterization is of two kinds, by fire and by caustic.	0.6865066
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.	Cauterization by fire will be thus: tell the patient previously, if he is one of those who pluck the lashes, to let them grow till they are long and straight; and if during growth they irritate him, bind the eyes with a fillet so as not to move till they have grown.	0.74520934
When they grow and are even, place the patient on your lap; then mark on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, with the beginning of the mark near the hairs; then apply cotton soaked in egg white and parsley mucilage on the eye, then heat the cautery of which this is the shape:	When they have grown and are straight, put the patient's head in your lap and mark upon the eyelid with ink the shape of a myrtle leaf, beginning near the lashes. Then apply cotton wool soaked in egg-white or mucilage of psyllium seeds. Then heat a cautery of this form.	0.8913611
Afterward, cauterize over the marked figure gently many times, so that the core is burned in that area; the sign of successful work is that you see the eyelid retract and the hairs lift from the eye's surface; then lift your hand, and leave it for three days, then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is gone; afterward treat with ointment until healed.	Then burn over the shape marked out, slowly, with many small strokes, till the whole surface of the skin marked out to the shape of the myrtle leaf be cauterized, specially the outer part of it. It will show the correctness of your work if you see the eyelid contracted and the lashes risen away from the white of the eye. Then remove your hand and let him be for three days. Then apply cotton wool soaked in butter till the scab falls off; then treat the place with ointment till healed.	0.8501407
And if after this the hairs come back and the eyelid is softened, then restart the cautery on the same spot as you did first; and if the hairs are outside, cauterize until the eyelid is lifted to its natural place, and is even, so the hairs do not prick the eye.	But if after an interval there be a return of the same condition of the eyelash and of drooping of the eyelid, repeat the cauterization in the same place just as you did before. And if it be in the lower lid cauterize this also till it falls back to its normal position and the hairs do not irritate the eye.	0.79549253
The cautery with burning medicine requires instructing the patient to let the hairs grow long and even, then making a shape like a myrtle leaf out of parchment; then take French soap and quicklime, each one ounce, and grind them together well; do it quickly so it doesn't cool, then spread it on the parchment shaped like the myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid; and if the disease is in one eye, work on one, or both if in both; place cotton soaked in egg white below the eye; and let the patient's head be on your lap and place your index finger on the medicine, pressing gently and moving it whenever the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, as it feels like fire. When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, wash the area with water, and check if you see the eyelid lifted as if by fire or incision; if so, it is good. If not, reapply the medicine on the spot where it has not worked, until your work is even and the eyes are aligned; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burned core falls off, afterward treat the area with ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.	Place your forefinger on the caustic and press it down a little and move it about according as the patient feels the bite of the caustic; for he will feel it sting like fire. While the stinging lasts, let the caustic remain on and move it about with your finger; and when the stinging dies down take away the caustic and wash the eye with water; then look, and if you see the eyelid raised up as by a blepharoplasty, either by fire or by incision, good. If not, repeat the caustic application in the place that the drug has not affected and which has not gone black, until your operation is complete and the eyelid draws together. Then apply cotton wool with butter till the crust of the burn falls away; then treat with Palm ointment or the like till it be healed.	0.9142437
And it is necessary to be very careful in your work so that no medicine falls into the eyes. And if the eyelid becomes soft again and the hairs prick the eye, restart the medicine on the softened spot of the eyelid exactly as you did before; afterward treat until it is healed; and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:	But in your operative procedure take the utmost care lest the least bit of caustic get into the eye. And if, after some days, the eyelid be relaxed and some eyelash irritate the eye, then repeat the application, particularly in that part of the lid that has dropped, in the same manner as before; and treat till cured. This is the shape of the myrtle leaf.	0.8205371
