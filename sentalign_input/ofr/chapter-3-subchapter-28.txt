The dislocation of the hand.
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its reduction is easier than other joints. However, it must be put back in place quickly, in the same hour that it is dislocated, before the area swells, or a hot abscess develops there.
And the reduction is done by placing the injured hand on a table, and the practitioner extends the hand and aligns it evenly, placing their palm on the prominence of the joint, and pushes until it returns to place. However, you must check if it is correctly positioned; then the patient should put the back of their hand on a table during the extension and reduction. 
And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient should place the back of their hand on the table, and the practitioner puts their hand on the prominence of the joint.
If it returns to place immediately, that is good. If not, then apply soothing plasters for hot abscesses, and leave it like that without trying again.
And if he cannot bear it, and you cannot put it back in place after a few days, the joint will remain crooked; and it does not harm the patient except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grip anything at all: then know that the nerves or arteries are cut; there is no other solution but to apply a cautery next to the injury, and perhaps nothing else will work. 
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster that we have mentioned, then bandage it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it like that.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, moisten it with warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
