On the treatment of fleshy swelling.
Chapter 63.
Know that in cutting for this swelling, there is danger that leads to harm in many cases.
Therefore, it seems to me that leaving it alone is safer for it.
And I am recalling the operation for it, and the types of swelling.
I say, therefore, that many swellings occur in the bodies that make up the testicles, and it happens from many causes, namely.
Either from an acute or sharp excess, which flows to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the swelling is like the color of the body, and it is not painful: and it is a hard swelling.
And perhaps it is a stone-like swelling, whose color is dark, and it has no sensation.
And sometimes it arises from the twisting of the arteries and their swelling, as has already been mentioned, or from the swelling of the veins.
Therefore, what comes from the swelling of the arteries is recognized by the appearance of the swelling when you press it with your fingers.
And it is not necessary that you touch it at all.
But that which arises from the swelling of the veins does not disperse at all when compressed with the fingers.
And now it is possible that an incision be made on this type and on the surrounding flesh: and so, you must cut the skin of the testicles.
Then, pull the testicle upwards and remove it with a white cloth; free the suspensory ligament from the vessels, tie the vessels, and cut the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from every part of the testicle.
If, therefore, the testicle is joined with those growing tissues, then it is necessary to draw out the testicle and cut it.
And if there is an adhesion between any part of the membrane or between the vessels, then you must free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh at the site of adhesion behind it, then you must cut all of it and remove the testicle as we have described.
When your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the remaining care until it heals.
