Varicose veins are large, swollen veins full of melancholic superfluities, which occur in several parts of the body; and it happens more in the legs of those who walk and who work and carry things than in others.
It is therefore necessary that you sometimes administer a purgative of bile, and then heal it with basil.
The treatment of hemorrhoids is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out; and the other method is that you lift the vein and draw it all out.
The cutting is done in this way: first bathe the leg with very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then constrict the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the area below the knee; then cut the vein in one place, or in two or in three, with a wide cut, then lift and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear; and then tie it off, and instruct him to abstain from foods generating black bile; and repeat the evacuation and healing when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The removal of it is done in this manner: shave the patient's leg, if there is a lot of hair, then put it in the bath, and bathe the leg with hot water until it becomes red, and the veins swell; and if you do not have a bath, warm it by the fire, and then cut it next to the vein along the top of the knee, or in the area below at the ankle; then open the skin with the hook, and peel the vein from each side, until it appears when it is felt; and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it looks like a white cord; then push the thread under it, until it is lifted from the skin, and then hang it on the hook gently, then cut it in another place three fingers above; then peel the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the thread, as you did, and hang it on another hook, as you did the first time; then make another cut, or several if you need to, then lift it, and cut it at the toe, then pull and lift it up to the second cut; then pull it from cut to cut, until it all comes out, then cut it; and if you cannot pull and lift it, put in a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it and pull it, and put a thread under it, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it comes out; and be careful not to cut it, because if it is cut, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and it harms the patient; and when you have pulled it all out, put on the wound wool soaked in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must split it lengthwise, but do not cut it through; and draw it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron instrument with which the vein is cut is curved, and does not cut, so that it does not sever the vein; and it has a large curve, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the shape:
