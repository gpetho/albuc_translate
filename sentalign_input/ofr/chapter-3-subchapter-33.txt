of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes sprained, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inwardly and outwardly.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and leans forward on the side where it is dislocated:
The reduction is easy, and one should extend it gently with one's hands when it is only sprained.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient sit upright, and an assistant hold him firmly by the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left twice, then stretch it upwards, and gently push the foot upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, pushing and pulling the foot;
if it returns, that's good;
if not, repeat the procedure, because it will return;
and if it cannot return this way, have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly fix a stake in the ground between their thighs, and tie cloths around it so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with their hands or a cord, that they tie above the ankle;
then each assistant extends evenly, and the stake should always be between the patient's thighs to hold the patient steady when extending;
then the physician evenly reduces the dislocation with their hands, and another assistant holds the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, apply the plaster and padding on top, and tighten firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and watch the nerves that are on the ankle behind, so that the bandage is not too tight;
then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage loosens, tighten it;
then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days;
and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if hot abscesses develop there, you must treat them as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
