Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the Treatment of Cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medications and the warning against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate. We have also mentioned cancer generated in the uterus and the warning against treating it.
The ancients mentioned that when the cancer is in a place where it can be completely excised, such as cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar accessible organs, to remove it entirely, especially if it is incipient and small. But when it is advanced and large, it should not be touched.
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that. The procedure for it, if it is accessible as we said, is to first give the patient several doses of black bile, then bleed him if there is clear fullness in the veins.
Then place the patient in a position suitable for the operation, then insert the appropriate hooks into the cancer, then excise it from all sides with the skin completely so that nothing of its roots remains, and let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.
Rather, squeeze the areas and extract all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can. If during the procedure you encounter profuse bleeding from a severed artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
