of castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book; and it is only necessary for two reasons: one is that the physician should know how to answer when asked about it, and know the treatment; and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals. 
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by pulling, or by cutting.
In the one that we do by pulling, we make the beast sit in hot water, until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand, until they are drawn back and you no longer feel them.
Of castration by cutting: you must hold the beast, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the spermatic cord, and cut on each testicle with one cut, when you have skinned them well; and leave some of the syfac and the thin syfac that is on the vessels; and this method of castration is better than the one done by pulling, because with pulling, perhaps some part of the testicles remains, which makes the beast desire lust; then treat the wound until it is healed.
