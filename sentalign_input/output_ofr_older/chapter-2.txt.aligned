We have told you in the first chapter all about diseases that require fire cautery or burning medicine, and the indications, causes, instruments, and forms of cauteries; and I have covered this chapter from head to toe, and I will proceed in this chapter in the same way so that one can find more easily what they seek.	ON INCISION, PERFORATION, AND VENESECTION, AND WOUNDS AND THE LIKE IN the first book I spoke of all those diseases for which cauterization is of value, either the actual cautery or that done with caustic medicines; and of their reasons and causes; also the instruments and the shapes of the cauteries. This I set out in chapters, from head to heel. In this book I shall proceed along the same route so that it will be easy for the inquirer to find what he is looking for.	0.84815687
And before I begin, it is necessary, dear son, for you to learn that in this chapter there is more danger and fear than in the first on cauteries, and therefore it requires greater caution.	But before I begin this you ought first to know, my sons, that in this book there is more risk than in the first, which treats of cauterization. Wherefore in this matter there should be greater circumspection.	0.8452536
For in the work of this chapter, there is often the evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and many die.	For in the course of the work of which this book treats there often occurs an effusion of the blood upon which life depends, in the opening of a blood-vessel or the incision of a tumour or the perforation of an abscess or the treatment of a wound or the extraction of an arrow, or in the incising for a calculus or similar cases; all of which are accompanied by uncertainty and fear; and in most death will supervene.	0.84318256
And I warn you not to undertake foolishness. For many types of people come for treatments. Some come who are so afflicted with their illness that they die quickly because of the madness they find in their illness, and from the severity of their malice; and one must be wary of these. And there are those who give you their opinion and say: "Wait, I am cured"; but the illness is treacherous. It is not right for you to consent to those who come to you with this manner, but place greater consideration on your honor than on your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely on that of which you are certain, and from which you can gain profit and praise; and use prognosis and indication in the treatments of your patients to which health may be converted; and this will help you acquire a good reputation, glory, and a memory of praise.	So I warn you against undertaking any case in which there is any element of doubt to you; for in the exercise of the art you will be mobbed by all kinds of persons with all manner of afflictions; some being so weary of their sickness that death itself is a relief on account of the extent of their sufferings and the length of their miseries, their illness being so settled as to presage death. Some will lavish their wealth on you and enrich you, in the hope that they may be curable, when their disease is mortal. You should not assist any of this kind who approach you; let your caution be stronger than your greed and desire for gain; and do not embark upon anything of this kind unless you have positive knowledge, which you judge adequate, about the way of bringing the patient a good outcome.	0.84941995
Very dear son, Our Lord grant you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.	May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance, and grant that you hit the mark and succeed; for it is in His hand; there is no God but He.	0.5394101
Now I have arranged this chapter for you by dividing it into chapters, according to what is in the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to toe, so that you may more easily find what you need.	I have arranged this book in sections as I did with the previous book on cauterizations, from head to heel; so you will the easier find in it what you seek.	0.82813597
