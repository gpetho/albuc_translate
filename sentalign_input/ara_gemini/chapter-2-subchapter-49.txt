Chapter forty-nine on incising the swelling that appears because of the artery or vein and is called aneurysm.
If an artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, a swelling often occurs, and similarly, the vein may also experience inflation and swelling.
The signs by which it is known whether the swelling and inflation are from an artery or a vein are that if the swelling is from an artery, it is oblong, gathered in the depth of the body, and if you press the swelling with your finger, you feel it as if it has a creaking sound, and if it is from a vein, the swelling is round, on the surface of the body.
Incision on these swellings is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many places of the body, and are very large, so you should avoid treating them with iron, and also those in the extremities or the head, so you should avoid [treating them].
So what is of them from the swelling of the mouth of the artery, make a lengthwise incision on the skin, then open the incision with hooks, then skin the artery and free it from the membranes until it is exposed, then insert a needle under it and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places as I explained to you in the pulling of the two arteries that are in the temples, then prick with a lancet the place between the two ligatures until all the blood in it comes out and the swelling dissolves, then use the treatment that generates pus until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is from an incision of the vein, you should hold with your hand as much of the swelling as you can, along with the skin, then insert a needle below the place that you held with your hand, and pass it through, and in it a double thread, until you bring it out from the other side, then tie the swelling well with it, according to what I mentioned to you in tying the uvula from both sides with the ends of the thread.
If you fear that the threads will slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling at the intersection of the first needle and tighten your threads in four places, then incise the swelling in its middle, so that when what is in it comes out, cut the excess skin and leave what was tied of it.
Then put on it a pad that you have dipped in wine and oil, then use the treatment that is with bandages and ointments until it heals.
