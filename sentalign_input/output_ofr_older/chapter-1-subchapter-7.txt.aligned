When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two corners of the head, one in the middle of the head, and one in the place called "vasselz" as we mentioned before, and the last cautery above the mouth of the stomach; and treat it as we mentioned before.	When an apoplexy has lasted a long while and has been treated by those methods we have given and your treatment has been ineffective but the patient has no fever, then burn him with four cauterizations: one on each frontal prominence; one in the middle of his head as we have described; and one at the back of the head as has been said. The shape of the cauteries to be as before.	0.79476
