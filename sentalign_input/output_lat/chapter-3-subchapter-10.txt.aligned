CHAPTER TEN.	Chapter XI.	0.705657
It is rare indeed that hip-bones are fractured, and if they are fractured the fracture consists of a comminution of the extremities of them and a longitudinal splitting and a bending inward; and the patient feels a pain and a piercing at the site, and the leg on the fractured side is benumbed.	The bones of the hip are rarely fractured. But if they do fracture, the fracture is usually just a breaking at the ends: they split lengthwise and incline inward, causing pain at the site and pricking, and the leg with the fracture becomes numb.	0.82125354
To set it, you pass your hand over it and ascertain what the shape of the fracture is.	The restoration is to lay your hand over it until you can discern the shape of the fracture.	0.66188216
If it is a fracture of the extremity only, set that fracture in whatever manner is convenient for you until it answers to its proper shape.	If the fracture is only at the ends, align it according to the preparations made for alignment, until it resembles its natural shape.	0.72725385
But if it be a longitudinal fracture or it has bent inwards, have the patient lie on his stomach so as to make it convenient for setting the fracture; and when you have set it apply over it a plaster and over that a splint of wood or leather, and bandage it in such wise that you have no fear that the fracture may extend or the splint slip.	But if the fracture is lengthwise or inclines inward, then make the patient lie on his stomach until the restoration of that fracture is prepared. When you have aligned it, place a plaster on it, then a splint from wood or leather over it: and bind it with a compression that does not fear displacement of the fracture nor the removal of the splint.	0.91443807
Level out the cavity of the lumbar region with some filling so that it may take the bandage evenly, and bid the patient sleep on his back or on his sound side.	And equalize any hollows with whatever will fill them, until the compression takes hold evenly: instruct the patient to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.	0.6525117
If there occur an effusion, then refrain from bandaging or setting it until the effusion subsides; and apply to it something to allay it as before said; then return to setting it and bandaging it as it should be.	If a hot abscess develops, then cease any extension and restoration until the hot abscess subsides: place on it what soothes it, as described before, then return to restoring it: and bind it as necessary.	0.798646
If there be any splinters in the bone or anything crumbles away from the extremities, it must not be pulled out or touched, but set externally as we have said, and the bandaging should be left until it heals.	But if it occurs in the sciatic bone, or is shattered, remove it.	0.5088276
