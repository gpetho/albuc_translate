O children, since I have fulfilled this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, by its completion in it, and by its expositions and declarations, it has appeared to me that you will complete that with this treatise which is a part of surgery through manual operation.
For the operation through manual technique is proscribed in our realm and in our times deprived of all, while greatly endangering the science of it, and its procedures are hindered; and nothing remains of it but some slight descriptions in the books of the Ancients which they have altered and led to those errors and misconceptions whereby the understanding of it is clouded and its power and art prolonged.
And it has seemed to me that you enliven that through the arrangement of this treatise according to its second way of exposition and declaration and abridgement; and so that the forms of the instruments of cautery and of the other tools of the work come through addition of declaration, and through preparation of it, which cause is necessary.
But the cause whereby no good artificer is found by the hand in our times is because the art of medicine is long, and that one who practices it before he be exercised in the science of anatomy, which belongs to Gualia, knowing the parts of the members and their forms, and the conjunction and separation of them; and having the knowledge of the bones, the nerves and the sinews, and the number of these, and their issue; and of the pulsating veins and the quiet ones, and the places of their issue.
And on account of this Hypocras says that one whose name is great but in action small, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already said of this in the introduction to this book; for who is not learned in that which we have said concerning anatomy, it is certain that he will fall into error whereby men will die, as I have seen many of these, for some are formed in this science and throw themselves from that without learning or experience.
For I saw a foolish and experienced physician incise a scrofulous abscess on the neck of a woman, and incised some arteries of the neck so that much blood flowed and the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who, when he had extracted a stone from a man whose condition was improved, and the stone was large, came to him and drew out that stone with a piece of the bladder so that the man died on the third day.
And I called to them to draw it out and saw that on account of the size of the stone and the disposition of the patient that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received stipends from a duke of our land for surgery, and he undertook to treat a negro who had suffered a fracture in his thigh; and preparing with his ignorance, drew out the fracture over the wound with powders and splints with strong compression and did not leave the wound to breathe.
And he let him loose according to his desires and bound him and left him for several days and commanded that we unbind the ligature; and it was thus until the thigh and the leg were apostematized, and it came to ruin.
And I was called to him and made preparation to unbind the ligature, and tranquility was achieved and he was eased of his pains.
But the corruption was nonetheless confirmed in the member so that I could not restrain it and the corruption continued to circulate in the member until the patient died.
And I saw another physician who perforated a cankerous abscess and it was ulcerated for several days until the evil of it grew great with its lord.
The cause of which is that the cold humor is pure, and it does not come to him by iron at all but that it be in a member which suffers that it be opposed to all things.
And on account of this, children, it is necessary for you that the operation through manual technique be considered in two ways: one is in operation which is associated with health, and the other in work whereby there is peril in the greatest dispositions.
And I have already expounded that in every place of this book in which occurs operation whereby there is error and fear; so that it is necessary for you to guard against that and leave it, lest the foolish bring about your harm through speaking.
And therefore take up your weapons with diligence and with God's protection, and your patients with gentleness and firmness.
And use the best way through God's grace for the sake of health and praiseworthy success and rid yourselves of terrible illnesses of difficult cure, and arm yourselves against that which causes you to fear so that trembling in your faith and in your name does not abandon you: for more remains for your glory and beyond in the world and in the last days for your saints.
Galia already said in some of his books: "Do not heal a bad illness lest bad physicians be named."
And I have arranged this book according to three chapters.
Begins the division of the book and first of the first part. The first chapter ordered concerning the feet, in the forms of the instruments and the tools of the cauteries, and of that which is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of bleeding and piercing, and of cupping-glasses, and of wounds, and of extraction of arrows and their likes, all capitulated and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, of reduction and of dislocation, and of cure for twisting and their likes; a chapter ordered concerning the feet and the forms of the instruments.
That I say the quality of the humors of that cautery and of the nocent things in it, and in what condition cautery is prohibited.
Therefore I say that the speech of the quality of the humor of cautery and of the nocent thing in it is long and prolixed, and subtle through science, and secret hid away; and already many wise men have spoken greatly of it, and from it they have disagreed, and for me a little of their speeches suffices, fearing prolixity.
And therefore I say that cautery confers universally on all complexions, save two complexions which are complexions of coldness without matter.
In the complexions of coldness and dryness with matter they disagreed; for some said that cautery is beneficial for it, and the others said the contrary of this, that cautery is not convenient in illnesses which are by quality and dryness, for the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that an illness of coldness and dryness be cauterized.
And he said the contrary of this that through cautery benefit is done in every illness of coldness and dryness which one sees in the bodies of men for when you compare the body of man and its moistures to the complexions of fire, you moisten the body of man.
And I say by the speech of that which, that experiment that already many times I have discovered.
But it is not necessary to come over here that which is already demonstrated and exercised in the chapter of cauteries by previous exercise, and has known the diversity of the complexions of men, and the disposition of diseases in their bodies, and the causes of those, and their accidents, and the space of time of those.
But in the other complexions, there is no fear over you, and especially in the moist and friction diseases, for all the doctors have agreed upon those, and are not disagreeing upon using cautery on them.
And know, children, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire and its goodness, is that it is a simple substance, whose action does not reach any other member except the one being cauterized, and does not affect another member with it except with minor harm.
But the action of the burning medicine reaches those members from which it is distant, and strongly brings about disease in the member difficult to heal, and strongly causes it.
But the fire, by its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do that except to make superfluous. And it is known to us through experiment and through the longevity of service of study on the truth of causes; and because of this I am excused from the length of speech. And if it were not that I was not read in this book to you, secretly hidden by the fire, and the quality of its operation on the bodies and its expulsion by which you expel diseases, with philosophical speech demonstrated, which would be acute in your ears.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time in which it is appropriate to perform cautery and pause at the best time of spring.
And I say that cautery is convenient in all times, because the harm by the accidental time is submerged in the benefit of that which is attracted by the cautery, and especially if the cautery is for pain or necessary pains, strong and violent, which do not tolerate delay so that they fear the evil that comes, which is greater than minor harm coming from the time.
And you should not listen to them, O children, or they will not believe it except the common people and foolish doctors; so it is that for this disease which is healed by cautery there is no reduction in all times, and they pause at that consequence.
And the cause is not as they think it to be, for cautery is only in place of medicine which alters the complexion and dries up the moistness which are the cause by which pain comes.
But cautery surpasses medicine in value and power of its operation, and grandeur of his lordship.
And it is possible that his disease will return at some time of the year, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his disease, and its power, and what has been prepared in his body by the accumulation of excesses in him, and what has come upon him through acquisition in foods and like those causes; but if the disease in which cautery was administered is a subtle disease in a member with few excesses and moistness, so that cautery of teeth for pain and its likes, it is possible that the pain will not return in him, but that happens little.
And it is a common saying that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and it is a true saying, not that they understand it to be, for they believe that there is no healing that benefits through medicine or other cause except cautery.
And the cause is in contrast to that; and the intention that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is not unless the manners of healing are administered in some diseases, and those medicines do not confer, and then at the end of the cause the man is administered cautery, and benefits from it. And from here we see that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the intention which the vulgar and foolish doctors understand it.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say it except for the equality of gold and sublimity of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not make it strong, and that is not absolutely true, for I have already proved and demonstrated that it does not do that except in some bodies without the others, and cautery with it is good and better than with iron as they said; but if you perform cautery with fire with gold, it is not declared to you, because it is made according to the amount you wish according to the roughness of the gold, and it prepares itself to receive friction; and if you apply ignition on it, the gold melts by the fire, and in the fire some sheets are placed so that the artificer sees through the occupation of that.
And because of that cautery with iron is made more lightly and closer to the correctness of operation.
And I have already arranged this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and have arranged those of the head among the feet, so that elsewhere I will ask him what he wants from it.
The first chapter:
This cauterization confers to moisture and coldness the accidental servant of which there are two causes, and it is caused by soda and multitude of flux, called neuritis, from the head to the parts of the ears and from the eyelashes flowing, and multitude of sleep, and of toothache and of gum inflammation, and universally of all disease that comes through friction, such as paralysis, lethargy, and apoplexy, and like in those diseases.
The form of this cauterization is this: first of all command the patient to be evacuated with laxative medicine the head cleansing, for three or four days, according to that the power of the patient and his age and habit.
And then command that he shaves his head with a razor, and then let him sit between your hands on a heated bench, and let him rest his hands on his feet.
And then pause the edge of your palm, and then put your fingers between your eyes. But however, when that part of the middle location has been reached, mark it with a tent, and then ignite the olive-oil cautery, of which this is the form:
And then put that on the marked location, in such a way that it descends, and your hand be slightly pressed there, and you revolve it.
And then lift your hand slightly and look at the location, and if you see already some quantity of the head uncovered, as well as the amount of hair, then lift your hand again, and if it has not returned your hand with that iron, with another, if it is cooled, while it is seen by you what I have told you.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it over the location, and let that be for three days.
And then put on it cotton soaked in vinegar and let that be on it until the scar of the fire is destroyed. And then heal the location with tetropharmacon unguent while it is healed.
And they said that when the Roman plaster is wet, then as many herbs are put on it, for that is better and more beneficial.
And some of them said that the jaw should be cauterized within the bone, and have the cautery within it until some part of the substance of the bone is burnt.
And then let that be scratched that which is burnt in the bone, and then let it be healed.
Others said that they reached the bone with the cautery before they put pressure on the strong bones, and this is the form of little Alcphatis. And they think that from that place they expel the vapors from the head.
And if the ulcer has been open for a long time and is not healing, it should be treated until it is healed.
But I have not seen these two kinds of cautery at all, except in some men according to the way of fear; and that one, as far as I am concerned, is a thousand times better for health when it is; because the head is devitalized by solution of continuity with him as we have witnessed in other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a frail nature.
And the first kind of cautery is more safe and better as far as I am concerned; and that one should be used for health, both its use and its work.
Chapter second.
Of cautery to the head.
When in all the head there is a chronic and long-standing pain which is prolonged in the patient, and he uses leeches and cupping glasses and caput medusae and plasters and poultices and bandages and cauteries and similar remedies, and especially if he has already been cauterized with one cautery which does not benefit him at all from those causes, then consider that if the patient's head is of a strong creation in its nature; and it is not frail but finds great pain from great heat, then cauterize it with another cautery after that first one. Then cauterize that above the crown of his head with a cautery until the scalp is split open. The scalp having been split and the quantity which we have mentioned having been opened up, cauterize that with a cautery in the back part of the head at the place which is called the foramen magnum —- and it is that place on which the ventouse is applied. And loosen your hand in it, and do not open the bone, for the patient will find much greater pain from that than from all the other cauteries of the head.
And I will tell you about this cautery in its place, because the cautery by which they cauterize the crown of the head and the occiput is much more subtle cautery than that with which the middle part of the head is cauterized; and this is the form of it.
Chapter third.
Of cautery for a new wound, not old.
When a sudden pain occurs in the front part of the head, or pain is extended to the eye, let it be evacuated with medicated washings, and let the other treatment be administered, which I have written about in the different diseases; and if all do not help, then cautery to it is in two ways: either cauterize with a sharp medicine that burns, or with iron.
But cautery with a burning medicine is that you take some alum and scrape it, and put the extremes of it on both sides of the head. Then cut into the site of the pain in the temple with a pointed lance until you have made a hole in it underneath the scalp, and cover it up.
And then tie it up over there with a bandage so that it might be tightly bound; and let it stay in that place for the space of three hours; and then loosen the bandage, and treat the alum, and let the ulcer remain for two or three days; and then put your hand over it, submerged in warm water, until the site becomes swollen.
And then cure that with an ointment until it is healed.
And if you want, do that with some burning medicines which I have written about in the second treatise on burning medicines.
But the cautery with iron according to this way: heat up the cautery of which this is the form:
and it is called a nail-shaped cautery, because the head of it has the shape of a nail with some curve to it, and in the middle part of it there is a small protuberance.
And then place it over the site of the pain, and hold your hand so that it might not be burnt by the cautery which is underneath; and move the iron little by little with speed.
And if the amount of it that is burnt by the heat of the cautery according to the thickness of the scalp were as high as the size of your fingernail, and raise up your hand so that the artery underneath might not be burnt, so that there might not come a flow of blood.
And then moisten the cautery in salt water and place it over the site for three days; and then apply a poultice soaked with warm water, and cure that with an ointment until it is healed.
And if you want, cauterize with the edge of a scalpel according to the cautery, and beware of cutting into an artery in this new wound that is not old.
Chapter fourth.
Of cautery for an old wound.
When you cure a wound with what we have said about the previous treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not help, and you see for the disease that it is not sufficient to it what we have said about the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire, then when you ignite the cautery cut until it turns white, place your hand over the site of the pain with a bandage and tighten that while you pierce the artery underneath and it comes out into the bone.
However it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the mandible, which is worn down by chewing, and that the ligament not be burnt and the nerve underneath it, and that no spasm come over it.
And if it is about the custody and caution of the flow of blood from the artery that it is cut, for there is danger in the cutting of it, especially for him who ignores what he does and is inexperienced and unskilled; and let the operation stop at the beginning.
And I will come with remembrance of the rule for the flow of blood accidentally from the artery according to its own way, in its own place in this free book.
And if you see that this disease does not help this cautery and you see the body of the patient tolerable, cauterize it in the middle part of the head as we have mentioned, and cure the ulcer until it is healed.
And if you want, administer the cautery which we have said in the chapter about stretching of the artery with cautery having two edges, and this cautery is better and more suitable.
Chapter fifth.
Of cautery for pains in the ears.
When in the ear there is pain from heat and it is cured with caustic remedies and with the other treatment which I have written about in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then ignite the cautery, and this is that one which has the name puncta, of which this is the form:
And then prick it with the cautery and heat it, and let it be moved around the whole of the ear as a wheel is turned, or in the circle of whichever part if the pain is in whichever part. Lengthen it with the cautery from the rim of the ear little by little so that you do not touch the site with the tip.
And if the cautery of ten points in all of the ear, and it, and then cure the sites until they are healed.
Chapter sixth.
Of cautery for torture.
Torture which is cured and cautery does not help except with remedies of the spices which come from phlegm, according as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the area that hurts due to dryness or due to a spasm in the nerve.
When you treat this kind of torture with poultices and bandages and healing remedies, and don't see any improvement, then you must cauterize the patient in three places: first at the root of the auricle, second a little below his temple, and third at the junction of the two lips.
And apply your cautery opposite to where it hurts because softening only comes from the side that is healing.
And the way to perform cauterization is to cauterize it on the right side of the highest part of the auricle a little bit above the corner of the head, and another one at the temple, whose length should be according to the length of the finger, and hold your hand with the cautery until half of the thickness of the hair is burnt.
And this is the form of the cautery, it is a kind of knife whose shape is described above. However, one should be more careful because it cuts deep in the skin. And if there are too many bumps on the surface, cut them a little bit.
Then treat the area with what is described above until it heals.
Chapter VII.
On cauterization for ancient apoplexy.
When apoplexy is ancient and you treat it with what we have described above but don't see any improvement and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries: on all of the corners of his head; and with cautery on the middle part of the head as we have said before; and with cautery on the neck. And the way to perform cauterization is as it is described above.
And he has already been cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is more effective this way; and he will be cured with what we have described.
Chapter VIII.
On cauterization for oblivion caused by phlegm.
Give the patient large poultices and pills that are purifying at the beginning.
Then rub the whole head of the patient and place on his neck a plaster made from honey as it is described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply it a few times, because that is the way to perform cauterization. And do it according to what we have said above.
And if he heals well with this treatment, good; and if not, then do to him three cauteries in the back part of his head which should go from the highest part of the head down to the neck. And place between each cautery the thickness of a finger, and treat the cauteries with what is described above.
However, if you see improvement and the patient tolerates it, then do to him cauterization in the middle part of his head; and if you see even more improvement, then cauterize him on both corners.
Then treat him until he is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped as it is described above.
Chapter IX.
On cauterization for a hernia and on softening of the whole body.
Give the patient poultices and treatment for the head as we have said above; then rub his head, and cauterize him with cautery in the middle part of the head, and with cautery on all of the corners of his head, and with cautery on the back of his neck, and with three cauteries on the spine of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the softening of the body to give him trops and the patients tolerate it and the apoplexy is strong, then cauterize him with four cauteries on the spine of the back, and lastly with cautery over his head until half of the thickness of the hair is burnt, and lift your hand. Then treat him until he is healed; and let this cautery be olive-shaped.
Chapter X.
On cauterization for epilepsy.
An epileptic is not cauterized unless the cause of his epilepsy is phlegm.
And therefore give the patient treatments for the brain at the beginning of his illness with herbs and with other remedies as we have said in the division when the patient is strong and tolerates the excessive use of remedies.
And if the patient is a child who does not tolerate remedies, then administer healing poultices and masticables to him for several days with the benefit of foods.
Then rub the head of the patient, and cauterize him with a cautery in the middle part of the head as we have said before, and with another cautery on his occipital bone, and with cautery on all of the corners of his head. And if the patient is strong and tolerates it, then cauterize him with cauteries as we have said before, having paralysis and softening of the body on the spine of the neck and the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped as it is described above.
However, if the patient is a child, then apply a subtle cautery according to this way:
Chapter XI.
On cauterization for melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are moist and rotten humors and phlegm, then cauterize him with cauteries as we have said in having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is excess and decline to melancholy, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him to drink what purifies his brain as we have said in the division.
Then rub the head of the patient, and make a decently made turban out of linen and place it on his head, and then hold it in place.
And let the patient be seated, and let him be held upright.
Then apply a liniment; and it is more worthy of being made from old sheep's wool. And warm it over the fire with moderate heat as we have said when he is in him. Then apply it on the middle part of his head on the circle, and hold it in place until it is cool.
And do this to him once a week for several times, with the other treatment of him being good until he is healed; or if you want, cauterize him making small points according to his condition: this is a kind of cautery which softens the brain equally.
Then apply it wrapped in wool or in cotton wool.
Chapter XII.
On cauterization for water descending into the nose.
When you have declared the beginning of water in the nose due to the sinuses as we have said in the division, then start and give the patient to drink what purifies his head, and guard him from all moistness.
And let him sweat in a bath with vinegar for several days.
Then command him to wash his head, and cauterize him with cautery in the middle part of the head; and then cauterize him with two cauteries on two temples if it is the beginning of water in two noses, or on one side if it is the beginning of water in one nose.
Strike with cautery all the veins and sinuses which are under the skin; and let the cauteries be long in length according to the length of the temples.
And guard against flowing of blood when he is cauterized; and if you see flowing of blood from him, stop it with some medicine which is possible for you.
I have come with wisdom that is in the extraction of arrows and in the bandaging of those [wounds] and the cauterization of blood flows.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the heads of the bones with two cauteries recently produced.
Chapter 13.
On the cauterization of ancient tears.
When tears of the eyes are old and frequent and the veins and arteries through which they flow are manifestly apparent on the surface of the head and it is verified that this is superfluous flowing phlegmatic fluids, then cauterize that with a cautery as we have recounted in the chapter on beginning of water gushing out in the eye, and with a cautery in the middle of the head and with two cauteries on the skull below the temples, and with two cauteries on the skull below the bones. And if it is necessary to add [to the cautery], then cauterize that in all sides of the eye socket over the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
On the cauterization of the stench of the nose.
When you are treating that with what we have said in the division and your treatment does not benefit, then you prepare and give to drink to the patient the cow's hoofs for three nights; and then shave his head and cauterize the middle of his head with a cautery made from an olive tree. And then cauterize that with a cautery made from a clove with two cauteries over the two eyebrows beneath the hair, a little one.
And be careful of the arrow that you do not burn it.
And of the cautery made from a clove, this is its form:
Chapter 15.
On the cauterization for softening of the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened due to sickness or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery made from this lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you like, cauterize that over the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in its entirety, and let them be elongated from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the amount of eyebrow.
And do not press too much with your hand with the cautery, but according to the amount that the upper part of the eyelid is attached.
Chapter 16.
On the cauterization of the eyelid when the hairs are converted to the parts within and close the eye.
When the hairs of the eye are converted to the parts within so that they close the eye, there are two ways of cauterizing them, either with a hot iron or with a burning medicine.
If with a cautery of fire, command the patient to look down at that so that he pulls his hairs down as they grow out and are cut off; and if it closes by itself, then you strengthen his eyes with a bandage so that he does not rub them as the hairs grow out.
Then when they are growing out and curling, then place the patient's head on your knee, and then draw a sign over the eyelid of his eyes with a pen, make the sign according to the shape of an olive leaf, and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
And then place cotton dipped in white vinegar or in mullein tea on the eye.
And then light the cautery of which this is its form:
And then cauterize over the figure which you have drawn, bit by bit, in small spots, until the surface of the skin is burned black and appears like an olive leaf, all apparently even.
And a sign of the health of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs of it lifted up from the punctured eye.
And then raise your hand and lay him down for three days, and then place on him cotton with balms until the scar is healed. And then treat that with ointment until it is healed.
But if they return for some reason and the eyelid is softened, then do the cauterization on that again entirely as you had done at first.
But if the hairs are in the eyelid beneath it, then cauterize that until it is elevated to its natural place and curled back and the hairs do not poke the eye.
But the cautery with burning medicine is that you command the patient to look down at his hairs as they grow out and curl back, and then let it be made from linen the shape of an olive leaf.
And then take a pounded soap and of live coals a handful. [Chapter title:] Take that and mix it with the ashes, and then add to those ashes honey, and make that into a poultice so that it is not cold; and then spread that on the linen which is made in the shape of an olive leaf, and place that on one eye or both; and let the eye be closed with a bandage and the patient's head be in your lap.
And place the thumb on the medicine and press that a little and let him not rub it as he feels the burning of the medicine, for the burning is in him as if by fire.
And then when he perceives that the burning, let him look at the medicine and bite it with his teeth; then when the burning ceases, let him wash the eye with water and then consider if he sees the eyelid raised as it is washed by fire or by incision, for then it is well; and if it does not return to that of the medicine on the spot where the medicine has not been applied and is not blackened as your operation is completed and the eye is contracted.
And then place on him a bandage so that the scar of the wound is eradicated, and then cure that with an ointment of theriac or another until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, after your operation, to watch diligently so that no pus falls into the eye from the medicine, and if the eyelid several days later is softened and some cause of the hairs poking into the eye, then repeat your medicine on that spot of the eyelid which is softened, and properly as you have done at the beginning, and then bandage him until he is healed.
And this is the shape of an olive leaf.
And know that men's eyes are diversified according to size and smallness, and therefore according to that is made your contraction.
And do not take the path of straightness to that to which it is directed in this art.
Chapter 17.
On the cauterization of a fistula that is in the tear duct of the eye.
When you are curing a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of illnesses and your treatment does not agree, then know that you cauterize that according to this manner: command the patient to place his head on your lap, and let him hold his head by some servant so that it is not rubbed nor moved by his head.
And then place on the eye of him cotton dipped in white vinegar or in mullein tea.
And then light the cautery of which this is its form:
Which is hollow, like a reed or a feather made from a vulture, with one extremity from which the cautery is made.
If you wish to go further into the other extremity, then you can do so by using a tent.
However, the one who is concave is better for your work.
Then squeeze the fistula if it is open, and draw out from him pus and dry up that place. And if it is not open, then cut it open and extract the rottenness from him.
Then place on him the cautery which has been well lit, and have your hand close to the cautery at the start of the nose so that your hand does not get burned or the patient disturbed, and then apply the cautery on the gums of the hole and corrupt that place.
And so if at the beginning of your cautery it penetrates into the bone, that is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, as needed; and leave that there for three days, and then place on that spot a poultice and wrap it up with a bandage until it is healed.
But if eleven days have passed and it has not healed, then apply to it a sharp, corrosive medicine so that the bone is uncovered and cut according to what suits you in your chapter.
And there is another way of cauterizing a fistula which some people say at the beginning: enter into the place of the fistula and open it up, and then in that fissure place soft solder with which is its shape; and pour into that the quantity of one ounce of melted lead; and keep your hand with good retention so that the patient is not burned as the melted lead does not reach the hole of that; and cover what you have placed over the hole of the patient with cotton or water, for the lead adheres to the place of the fistula and heals it by a marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about cauterization and treatment, that is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a blow to the nose and reduce the fistula into the nose according to what will come into its proper place.
Chapter 28
On cauterization of a split in the jaw.
Often there are fissures in the lips, and especially in the lips of children.
So if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the sections and your treatment does not benefit, then ignite the cautery with a small knife in this way that it is filled:
And let its cavity be according to the thinness of the knife.
Then place that gently into those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat that with ointment so that it is healed.
Chapter 29
On cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula or in the palate or in the roots of the teeth, a pustule is formed and then bursts, and then becomes old, and pus and blood flow out, and there is a fistula, and you treat it and your treatment does not benefit, then when you ignite cautery according to the quantity that is received in the fistula, then place that fire into the hole of the fistula, and keep your hand so that the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and at its back do this one or two times; and then treat that with what we have said about treatment so that it is healed.
And so if the pus is discharged and it is healed, that is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and cut away the corrupted bone according to what comes into its chapter.
Chapter 30
On cauterization of teeth and softening of gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are aching, and you treat those with medicines and do not help, then place the head of the patient into your lap, and ignite the cautery in the form which will come there, so that you place the canule over the tooth and insert into it the cautery ignited quickly, and keep your hand close to the patient's mouth so that the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth where it has pervened.
And then lift up your hand, and repeat the cautery several times according to what you want.
And then the patient should fill his mouth with salt water and keep it for an hour, and then spit it out, for the aching tooth is calmed and the softened gum is strengthened and the corrupted moisture is dried up.
Chapter 31
On cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or in it is cold or red, or the treatment with medicine does not help, then cauterization in that place is according to two methods: either cauterization with an iron brand, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with an iron brand is that you take an iron brand and heat it in a charcoal fire, and then grab the hot end and wrap it in a cloth and place it on the end of the tooth gently until it is cold.
And then repeat that several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cloth in the fire below it, and place that over the painful tooth, and place the hot iron on top of it so that the iron reaches the cavity of the tooth.
However, cauterization with fire is that you await the needle of iron or of copper, and let it be in its center some thickness and the keenness of the fire not reach the mouth of the patient.
And then ignite the cautery in the form which will come, and place that over the tooth and keep your hand so that the cautery is cold; and do this several times because the pain still continues or on another day.
And have the patient fill his mouth with good water and keep it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the form of the cauterization.
And cauterize with what you wish extreme according to what is possible to you.
And this is the form of the needle:
Chapter 32
On cauterization of hernia.
When hernia are of phlegm and cold humors and are not cured by medicines, and you wish to cure them gently, then ignite the cautery such that its smoke reaches the hernia on one side, and then place it ignited on the hernia another time, so that it reaches the bottom of the hernia.
And if the hernia is small, then place the cautery according to the quantity of the hernia, and then let it be for three days and place over it a poultice soaked in ointment so that it is heated up by what the fire has burned.
And then treat that with ointment and bandages so that it is healed.
Chapter 33
On cauterization of throat and constriction of voice.
When moisture comes upon the throat of the lung, and especially when it is due to coldness of complexion, then have the patient evacuate at the beginning with laxative medicines, and then cauterize that after the root of the larynx in the place which is inflamed.
And be careful that you do not bring the cautery to his throat or burn any part of him except a little.
And cauterize this with another cautery at the joint of the neck in the last vertebrae of the patient. The cautery for him should be a hot iron according to the previous manner.
Then treat the patient with what has been previously described so that he may heal.
Chapter 24.
Of cauterization for illness of the lung and cough.
When cough and lung illness are caused by cold humors infiltrating, and the patient has no fever nor consumption but rather an ancient illness, then cauterize him with two cauteries over the furcula in the locations beneath the collarbones, and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cauteries be hot according to the previous form.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be with the pointed cautery that is called 'puncta', the form of which has been described in the puncturing of ear pain.
And let the points be placed within those; then treat the patient with what is previously described so that he may heal.
Now let the cautery have three ramps, for there are three cauteries to be done according to this form; with one blow you can do three cauteries like this:
Chapter 25.
Of cauterization of the tickling in the throat.
When the throat is dislocated due to slippery humors and has not yet returned to its proper position, and it is displaced by even the slightest movement as we have testified, then first reduce the dislocation, then let the patient return to his normal posture and let him lie on his back or his left side; then raise his chin which is in the front part of the tickling up towards the parts above with your left hand fingers if the joint is dislocated in the front.
And let the cautery have two points; and this is its form:
Then cauterize where it penetrates into the other side; then the figure of the cauterization will be as follows with four cauteries:
And sometimes it is adjusted according to the account by which there are eight cauteries.
Then place a little salt on the cautery and let the patient adhere to tranquility, and do not disturb the member for some time until it is comforted.
And if the dislocation is above and tight then do this: cauterize over the muscle with a hot cautery or with pointed cauteries, for the joint is confirmed and the humidity removed and the patient healed.
Chapter 26.
Of cauterization of the stomach.
When there is a movement in the stomach and the humors multiply within it and extract from its natural place and if you continue the methods of cure without concern, then let the patient lie on his back with his arms and legs extended and cauterize him with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet according to the amount of a finger with a hot cautery, and two cauteries below the ribs so that the figure of the cauteries comes to a triangle; and separate those which are not fitted because they will make a piercing.
And if the depth of the cautery is according to the quantity of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cautery be according to this addition, and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this is a cautery according to the form of a circle according to this form.
And let the stomach be punctured at where this cautery frightens him: and you sense on the stomach according to the quantity that you wish with tentation, and then cauterize him at the points; and then treat him with the cure that has been previously described so that he may heal.
Chapter 27.
Of cauterization of a feverish liver.
When one feels in the liver pain due to chill or humidity or from grossness and it is driven from its natural place by an excessive egress of superfluous humors, and is treated with what we have said but without concern, then let the patient lie on his back with his arms raised, and sense three cauteries according to this form and quantity placed on the liver below the hypochondria where the position of a man's elbow would be.
And let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger, and let the cauteries be according to the length of the body towards the right.
Do not move your hand while placing the cautery.
And if the amount of that which is heated is according to the thickness of a finger's tip and there is not much heat; and if the patient stands on his feet; then let him sit, for he has already extended himself and raised his arms.
And to you it is possible that you cauterize these cauteries with a cautery needle when you are subtle and prudent in the art.
And beware that you do not apply too much in the cauterization, and let the surface of all the skin be heated so that it penetrates throughout the body and into the intestines, for here the liver is subtle; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Of puncturing a boil on the liver with a cautery.
When there is a boil or ulcer on the liver and you wish to know if this boil is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the liver the patient will suffer grave pain and acute pain.
And if it is in the tunic of the liver then with the pain being very acute and having fatigued the doctors with his cure.
Then let the patient lie on his back, and sense the location of the boil with tentation; then let the cautery be like a needle, the form of which has been described in the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery throughout so that all the skin is heated and it penetrates into the intestines, where one would expect pus to flow.
Then treat him for the cure of other boils so that he may heal.
And do not use this form of cautery except by him who has practiced it in the art of medicine and in whose hands many illnesses have been cured; but instead experiment this once or twice on a patient, but then let them stop.
Chapter 29.
Of cauterization for a hernia.
We have observed the old cauteries of the roots of aristology for a hernia caused by cold humors infiltrating according to this manner: take from the roots of aristology a long dry root which is found, and let it be of the thickness of a finger.
Then soak it in oil and heat it over the fire, then cauterize with a cautery at the location which is between the continuation of the furcula near the neck; and with two small cauteries below the armpits, one slightly declining towards the part where the beard grows, and two cauteries above what declines between the fifth rib and the collarbone, declining slightly to the parts behind; and let there be a cautery at the middle of the chest; and another cautery at the location which is between the two shoulders, and two cauteries on the sides of the chest below the armpits.
And do not put your hand on the cautery, but rather hold it in front of you in plain view.
And some ancient writers say that there are some people who use a cautery made of iron similar to a needle and they ignite it and apply it to the space between the ribs until they reach the apoplexy and the pus is discharged, just as we have said about the apoplexy in the liver.
But with this piercing by cautery, there is no fear, for when it happens in the location of a fistula to which there is no cure.
Chapter 30.
Of the cauterization of the ulcer.
When you cure the illness of the ulcer with what we have said about treatment in the division and do not delay your treatment, then the cautery on it is according to three methods, all of which are correct, one of which is that you make three cauteries or four depending on the length of the ulcer according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, the figure of which has preceded.
And between each cautery, the thickness should be the thickness of a finger or a little more, and the manner of the cautery should be the same way we have described in the cautery of the liver alike.
And do not put your hand on the cautery, and let the patient be elevated above his head.
And there is another way to cauterize, which is that you ignite the cautery having two turnings, the cause of which we have said in the chapter on dislocation of muscle, and elevate the vein which is at the end of the ulcer through which passes the jaw of the left patient.
And let your elevation be such that you elevate the vein according to the length of the body so that the cauteries are made according to the width of the body.
Then insert the two turnings, ignited, into it through which you penetrate the vein from the other side.
And then pull out the cautery; and so there are four cauteries made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three turnings.
And then you treat the cautery once it has stopped bleeding for several days, for it is better that the other causes precede in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
Of the cauterization of hydrocephalus.
A cautery is not cut in hydrocephalus but rather in the anus properly.
When you cure hydrocephalus with the methods of treatment we have said in division and do not delay your treatment, then what you should cauterize are four cauteries around the anus and one cautery on the stomach, and another cautery on the liver, and another cautery on the ulcer, and two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right side of the foot, and another cautery on the stomach. And the quantity of the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the thickness of the vein.
And then let the cautery bleed openly so that it bleeds for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient of curing after the cautery with that which it may be for so that two intentions are added to him and healing is encouraged by him.
The shape of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be key-like according to that which is above it preceding, and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped according to what precedes it.
Chapter 32.
Of the cauterization of feet and of the thighs.
When the feet are apostematized in hydrops and filled with yellow water, then you should cauterize the feet on the instep of the foot in nocary which is between the auricular and the annular, and elevate your hand with the cautery and do not turn it; and then elevate your hand and do not return it at all, for the yellow water will exude.
It is the cautery according to this shape: and then make two cauteries on both thighs, and in each thigh let there be made a cautery with the end of the cautery-knife. And let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh: one from below and the other above the middle part of the thigh; and over each thigh, two cauteries.
And let the wound bleed openly without curing for a long time so that some water exudes from it.
And then cure them with those causes which we have said.
Chapter 33.
Of the cauterization of a body of the belly.
When a body of the belly is from rubbing and from moisture so that the digestive and retentive virtues are impaired, which are in the stomach and in the intestines, and it is cured with those methods of treatment and does not delay, and sometimes the patient suffers a cautery from an exhiberant virtue, then cauterize it with a large cautery on its stomach according to what has preceded in the cauterization of the stomach, with the cautery of the circle and four cauteries around the anus subtly, with a key-like cautery subtly; and with a cautery over the anus over aloee greatly, or two cauteries.
And if sometimes the humidities are abundant and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize it over the penis and over the intestines, and tightly close two cauteries over the stomach near the inguinals, for this is a perfect cure of the rejuvenation of which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
Of the cauterization of ancient hemorrhoids.
When it is in nature to have ancient hemorrhoids or one of thick humors rubbed or of corrupt humidities and they are cured with that which we have said in division and do not delay your cure, then cauterize them with three cauteries over the pus below the small vertebra of the back triangularly, and with a cautery above the navel through two punctures.
And if it happens that the stomach of him is rubbed and his food is not digested and his face is sometimes apostematized, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery according to what has preceded; and with a cautery on the liver, and another cautery on the ulcer with a key-like cautery, and let the cautery bleed openly for some time, and then cure it so that it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Of the cauterization of an eye near its incision.
When you excise an eye, then ignite the cautery which is assembled like a needle. Then insert that ignited into that excised eye, and let your hand be over it until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do it once or twice, for if there are several, then cauterize each of them according to what we have recounted, and then cure them with that which corresponds to them in the gums so that they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery over the anus, it is better for rejuvenation.
Chapter 36.
Of the cauterization of fistulas which are made in nature in the openings of him.
When nature does not obey the work which we have recounted in its place and the patient is terrified by it, let him be healed with cautery.
Therefore when you see a fistula in nature and it is old, with rotten water and corrupt humidities, and therefore that which is best to do is to pierce it with a subtle needle, and then know the quantity of its depth according to what we have said before.
Then ignite the cautery which resembles a needle. And then place that burning cautery in this fistula, and according to the amount it penetrates.
And repeat on that cautery until those corrupted humors are burned up once or twice or three times according to the quantity of your need.
And beware of burning a nerve or vein; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder or hernia, then beware of all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you are certain that it does not penetrate.
Then heal the wound where it was done.
And if the wound is sealed and the materials removed from it and remain like that for a long time, then know that it has healed completely.
And if the materials are not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating into its bone or that its bones are corrupted, or that one of those causes for which a recurrence will come to mind in that place.
Chapter 37.
Of cauterization of the sinuses.
When in the sinuses there is pain from rubbing or from a great windiness and because of this the patient's head is hurt, then it is necessary that you cauterize that above the sinuses with a cautery needle of which you will learn by memory.
And then quickly cauterize it again a little bit lower, so that three cauteries will come out lined up, and therefore there will be more behind in succession.
Chapter 38.
Of cauterization of the bladder.
When debility and softening occur in the bladder due to rubbing and humidity such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it in the lowest part of the pus-filled bladder, where the hairs of the pubic hair begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side, and with another on the left side.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the quantity of the pus; and cauterize it with a cautery in the lowest pus-filled part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let it be a needle cautery as it is processed.
Chapter 39.
Of cauterization of the hernia.
When there is rubbing and humidity in the hernia, and because of this impregnation is prohibited, and its menstruations are corrupted, and they are delayed in being provoked, and pain occurs due to their retention, then it is necessary that the place be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, just as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the lowest pus-filled part of the back, or with two cauteries, and let it be a needle cautery.
Chapter 40.
Of cauterization for the dislocation of the elbow.
When moist humors are infiltrated in the part of the elbow, and this is caused by a dislocation of its joint, and the sign of it is that the bone protrudes over the other when they are compared between each other. And the place of the dislocation is blocked in where it was bent.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient above the part of the elbow with a circular cautery needle, just as you will have discovered by feeling in the circuit of the part just as it is bent, and so that the part falls into the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery of which it was preceded be the form in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not at hand, then cauterize it with three cauteries with a large olive-shaped cautery needle.
And let the cautery be done according to the quantity of the spiciness of all the thread; and then heal that which was done until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
Of cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes in the part of the elbow and this is caused by rubbing and humidity, the patient is cured by what we have said and does not confer, and it is old, then it is necessary that you release the patient from gross humors with fetid pills or artificial pills or similar; and then cauterize it.
And the manner of the cautery in that is according to two manners: or cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
They go according to two known manners, of which the one is that you cauterize it above the part of the ankle with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and do it on those good and deep. And let the space between each cautery be the quantity of the thickness of the finger, and if the cautery is olive-shaped or large.
Sometimes let the cautery be in the middle above the head of the elbow so that there are four cauteries.
And if you want, cauterize with the circle of which its form is preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the elbow, so that it is a containing circle and burns the spiciness of all the thread.
And this is the manner of cauterization in sciatica when the pain is attached to the elbow and it is not extended into the leg.
But if it is extended into the leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the leg above the place to which the pain goes; and with one cautery above the ankle in four places a little from the hairy part.
And if the cautery cuts, then let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the spiciness of the thread.
And if the pain goes so that it is extended into the place between the fingers of the feet, then cauterize it where it goes in with cautery for three points or four or more if it hurts there.
And if the pain goes down to the knee of the leg, then cauterize it there with a cutting cautery.
And beware in all cauterization that you do not finish with the cautery until it burns nerve or large artery, and that because of this there is much harm to the patient or contraction.
And you have seen one of those which they cauterized on the ankle and finished in the cauterization, and fire filled up inside so that a tumor was achieved in the leg, and it perforated and corrupted all the leg. Then a strong solution of the belly occurred, and then death.
And if the pain is in two parts equally, then cauterize each one according to this manner.
And the wise men said in the cauterization of the elbow that this is the manner of the cautery: make it like a nail circle, of which the circuit is the length of the palm; and let its holes be according to the thickness of an almond or a little more.
And inside that circle let there be another third; and let the space between them be the quantity of the thread of the finger; and let those circles be bent in two parts; and let the length of those be a thread or two threads, and make it in that margin of iron decently bent in the circles; and this is its form:
Then it is ignited in the fire so that it becomes hot and scatters sparks, and then it is placed over the part of the elbow, the pain lies over its side. Then cauterize it with three cauteries around in one go.
And let that be left for three days; and then plaster that with a poultice and leave the wound open for several days; and then heal that with ointment until it is cured.
Al-Buqaysi's days: Oh sons, we have used this type of cautery sparingly due to the terror instilled by those who guard him, and because we have found few who are willing to watch over him.
But of the good cauteries that he endures, and finds the place on him.
But the cautery with medicines that burn, you will make two circles having an awl pierced in which is inserted the tip of the iron door; let the length of the parts in the nature of them be two walnuts or acorns those.
And if the space between each one is the quantity of the thickness of the finger; and they are open below and above, and they are held together according to this form:
Then place the part of the armpit of the patient on his side, and press your hand over the part of the armpit; then take some water and pour it between the two circles, and let its quality be with the fire little by little, and hold that for the quantity of an hour, and let the patient endure the biting and the squeezing of him - for he will endure that biting as if from fire - until the biting ceases.
And then raise your hand with the instrument and wash the warm water all over the armpit.
And let that be left for three days and place a poultice over it until the blackness of the squeezing is gone, and let that be left for some days, and then pus will flow from him; this is last in healing.
And then heal that with ointment until it is cured.
And if the pain extends into the thigh or leg, make him stand in water according to how it is made in the armpit equally.
And this is the way of warm water, and I have already written that in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take an ounce of alkali and a non-extinguished part of both in one part, grind them and place them in a new pot in which the bottom is pierced with a small hole, according to the quantity that goes into him.
And place below the bottom of the other pot a pot glazed inside, and pour over that alkali and live embers of warm water which covers those by an inch, and then squeeze those with your hand by good compression, and let the hot water drip from him into the lower pot.
And then collect all that water and pour it over the other live embers and another renewed alkali, because that sometimes rises with great force, which is administered in very active doses in medicine and in cauterization of the other members, because that operation makes fire.
And some medicines with which wide cauterization is made, such as theriac and honeyed vinegar and soap embers mixed together.
And a man of the olden times recounted the operation and the cure with which it is cured the pain of the armpit and sciatic vein, and he magnified that much indeed, and said that it did not need any other cure, and that it is healed by one application like a blister, because it enters deeply in a bath and perspires, and then it goes away.
And let it be taken from the root of a certain plant, and if it is not obtained, let it be taken from a recent fig, and let that be ground with a little salt and placed on the armpit or thigh or leg where there is pain, and let it be bound up.
And let that be left for the amount of three hours or for the quantity that the patient tolerates the biting of it.
And then put him in a bath and when his body is heated, take him out into the sun, for the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that it does not matter if anyone uses cauterization with these medicines unless there is also an evacuation of the body.
Mays Ja Escorides said that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with a goat's tendon, it benefits him much; and let the cauterization be done according to this way: take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it between the instep and the heel.
And then take a dry goat' tendon and inflame it with fire until it is made charcoal; and then place it over the wool and let it be left until it is extinguished. And then repeat that, and do not cease doing that until the biting sensation reaches the armpit and the pain ceases.
And this way of cauterization is called the cauterization of cows.
Chapter .Xlii.
Of the cauterization for pain in two.
Sometimes pain is in the back due to various causes, such as from chill or from piercing or from excessive evacuation, and for similar reasons, from infusion of wet and friction.
And cauterization is not done except in this sole case which is made by effusion of wet material.
So when evacuation of the patient is done with fitting pills and like that, let them be made over the back where there is pain in three lines according to its breadth, so that you start cauterization at one end of each line towards the other, according to the amount tolerated by the patient and the strength of him.
And let cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you want, cauterize with three cauteries or four with a mid-clavus cautery according to this form:
Chapter .Xliii.
Of cauterization at the beginning of gonorrhea.
Many times this malady occurs in young children, and its sign at the beginning in children is that they experience stricture of the urethra in the penis during urination as well as erection and movement.
And they feel tightness at the last vertebrae of the back and of the loins which begin to rise above the others.
And then when you see that and want to prohibit it, let it be cauterized with a cautery which is circular according to this form: take the cautery over all parts of the vertebrae evenly.
And if you want, cauterize around the circuit of the vertebrae with a pointed cautery by two lines or three. Let the points be close to each other.
And then heal the place until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cauterization is not administered in gonorrhea which is made by spasm of nerve.
Chapter .Xliv.
Of the cauterization for gout and joint pain.
When joints are made by wet humors which infiltrate each part of the body, then when pain occurs in the feet, it is usually called gout by doctors.
And therefore if gout caused by friction is healed with the way of cure and the pains are not gone away, then cauterize it.
And you shall cauterize that especially after evacuation around the circuit of the joint of the penis with many cauteries.
And let it be olive oil of which this is its form:
And if it is necessary that points be made on the surface of the penis, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pains enter the testicles or to the other joints, and it goes many times, then cauterize that on each testicle with three cauteries or four on all sides with this olive oil cautery.
And if you need to perform cauterization on the patient, then it is necessary for you to cauterize them with a pointed cautery instrument without applying too much pressure with your hand before doing so, and only around the area of the vein.
And if the pain extends from the joints into the stomach and intestines, then administer the cautery as we have described in its respective chapter.
And if the pain is only in the hands and is called sciatica, then make points on the circumference of the fire vessels as they revolve, puncturing in those two lines.
And if there is remaining pain in the fingers, then puncture on the circumference of the fire vessels on each knuckle and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pain extends for several days into the hips or muscles, then cauterize each of these parts all over.
And do not discharge the patient from good regulation and reception of medicines, for if there is good regulation and phlegm is discharged with this cautery they will recover, God helping.
Chapter .45.
On the cauterization of broken bones.
When a rupture occurs in the angles and the intestines are pushed forward out of their cavity towards the genitals, and this is how it usually starts, then you must order the patient to stop eating for the day and use healing remedies so that the rupture can descend from his belly.
Then follow the patient's back with your hands over his spine, and order him to hold his breath as you examine whether there is a hole or the intestine or hernia has appeared.
Then return it with your fingers and touch the rupture on the bone of the hip, indicating the end of which is similar to a half-circle at the upper parts of the body.
Then ignite the cautery, whose shape is as follows:
until it becomes red and blisters form. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient' s thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then place the cautery on that indication with your hand holding the cautery straight, and apply it there until you reach the bone of the hip within the muscle; and repeat with another application if you do not achieve this on the first application to the bone.
And carefully observe the position of the intestine during the cauterization so that you do not burn it such that it brings death or another serious illness to the patient.
And know that when you apply the cautery and do not reach the bone, your procedure will be incomplete.
And know that the cautery for children should be thinner according to their size.
Then treat the area of the cautery for three days with wine until the scar of the fire has healed.
Then treat that with other remedies until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on his back for 40 days until the area is sealed and healed.
And know that you should regulate his diet according to the length of time it takes him to heal, so that the rupture does not come out again due to the effort of healing.
And when he wants to get up after 40 days, then administer a decently made ligature and have him wear it for another 40 days.
And he should be rested from work and the consumption of food and drink, and from violent movements, for when he uses this healing regimen entirely he will recover.
And now I will describe the healing of ruptures in other parts of the belly, and so at the beginning, and you want me to translate, then cauterize that rupture with a red hot cautery according to its quantity, and it is what has come out from the vein; then treat that as we have said, and it has not been adjusted.
And now I will say some first principles that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this form, because it is touched by probing:
and it is drawn as a line that goes through the length of the rupture, and another line above it; then place your hand with a nail-shaped cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter .46.
On the cauterization of torture.
When there is pain in some parts from bruising or impact, and the pain persists for a long time and does not yield to any medicine, then you must cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And the cautery should be performed on all parts according to its magnitude and smallness, its strength and weakness, the location of torture and pain.
So if he is healed by the first cautery, it is good; and if not, then do the cautery again; for usually those pains are caused by punctures of a member near that member, so that you must cauterize them in order to heal the patient.
Chapter .47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
The lepers sometimes receive cauterization for great benefit, and especially if the leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And so when you want to cauterize him, consider whether the leprosy is dry and as that which is healed by what we have said in the division, not this one, and be afraid of the patient that the corruption spreads through his whole body and all its complexions, then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: with one in the middle of the head, and with the second lower down on him, above the forehead; and both over the horns; and with one behind, on the nape or back of the neck.
And finally, your hand with the cautery lightly on the bone until a small impression is made, and from him are displaced the scabs, so that the expiration of thick vapors is relieved from him; then cauterize over the pus according to what has been prescribed.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the body and appears manifestly, then you must cauterize him with those cauteries which we have said in the head; and with a cautery on the end of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two sides of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two sides of the neck, and with six cauteries on the spine of the neck, and with one large cautery over the spine near the armpit, and with a cautery on each shoulder blade, and with two cauteries on the knees, and with one on each ankle, and with two cauteries on the hips, and with one great cautery over the spine, and with two cauteries on the shins, and with two cauteries on the tendons of his arms, and with one great cautery over the tendons of his feet, and with two cauteries on all the joints of his hands and feet.
And be careful of the nerves which are upon the heel so that you do not burn those.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the hip and with another over the mouth of the stomach, and with another over the tongue.
And know that when you bring the cauteries closer together, they benefit more and are more effective; and know that the patient does not have pain from the cautery, but as if his body is stupefied.
And those who have great or few cauteries according to the parts and joints as it is preceded by the spices of the tools.
Then treat the cautery with flour of bran cooked in honey and with the other treatment until it is healed.
Here begins the forty-eighth chapter.
Of the cauterization of a stupor.
When a member is paralyzed or asleep and is treated with medicines, oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then you should cauterize the paralyzed member with cauteries according to the size of the member or its smallness.
And let your cautery enter the thickness of the vein a little. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes there is cauterized a stupor which lies in the hands and feet, and in the vertebrae of the back, and see the course of the nerves which move that member, and the stupor is removed.
But do not presume about it unless he is skilled in the anatomy of the members and in the going out of the nerves throughout all the body moving.
Here begins the forty-ninth chapter.
Of the cauterization of leeches which are morphea.
When leeches are ancient and do not respond to any of the ointments of medicine, then you should cauterize them with a little hot cautery according to the quantity of the thickness of the vein until the whiteness and color is removed and the color changed.
Then treat it with bran and lentils, and rose oil, and leaves of arnica, and pigeon blood or blood of a wild goose, each one being a portion and all being mixed together, and then let it be bound up in a cloth and placed over the spot until it is healed.
Here begins the fiftieth chapter.
Of the cauterization of warts.
When a wart begins and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a ring cautery around its circumference as it is turned.
And the wise say it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle of it; but I have not seen this, because I am afraid that it would be ulcerated and I have seen this happen several times.
And it is more appropriate that it is cauterized around its circumference with a ring as we have said, or with sharp cauteries.
Here begins the fifty-first chapter.
Of the cauterization of tumors.
When a tumor is delayed in its maturation, and also because of the superfluity it produces that, or because of the condition of the patient, when he is old and decrepit, or few-blooded, or because of time, and you want to hasten the maturation of the tumor; then cauterize around its circumference with small sharp cauteries; and then let it be lanced so that it will hasten in maturation.
But if you want to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the shape of it: and apply it in the middle of the tumor so that it penetrates the vein.
And if the cautery is in a place which is lower down, so that the body of the arm is lifted up; then treat it until it is healed.
Here begins the fifty-second chapter.
Of the cauterization of corrosions.
Corrosion is a corruption that walks in the member, which corrodes it as if fire were eating dry wood.
Therefore, if you see this corrosion in a place which suffers cautery from fire, then heat small nail-like cauteries a little, and large ones according to what is convenient in that place in which the corrosion is.
Then cauterize it all around so that you eradicate all the corrosion and not leave any cause of it remaining.
Then let it be bound up for three days, and apply over the cauterized spots a poultice of soft liniment so that the scars are all eradicated and all the corruption.
Then treat it with ointments that engender flesh.
But if after three days the flesh does not grow there and is healthy, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on that which was removed in the corrupt places.
And corrosion is treated sometimes with sharp medicine, for that is halfway to cautery. But nevertheless cautery with fire is the purest youth-giving remedy.
And I have also said the cure of it with sharp medicine in the division, and therefore take that when you will have need of it.
Here begins the fifty-third chapter.
Of the cauterization of warts and of the others like them.
Many times there appear beneath the feet of the sick person who is called a claw, and it is a great cause, deep-seated, which pierces the foot; and cautery of them is according to two manners, namely cautery with fire and cautery with water.
But cautery with fire is that you ignite the cautery bent like a pen of an owl, which is made of iron according to the quantity that contains the claw all around, and it has fine edges.
Then apply that ignited cautery over the claw, and then turn your hand with the cautery around the claw so that the cautery reaches the depth of the claw. Then let it be bound up for three days until the arm begins to move. Then poultice it with mallows bruised with salt, and apply the poultice over it for one night, for that will eradicate the roots of them.
Then treat the spot with an ointment that engenders flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not converted, and many times it occurs in the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then take a quannula of lead or iron or of an owl-pen, and apply that over the claw; and then pour into the quannula a little water, and hold your hand there and turn the cautery around the claw so that the water reaches the depth of the claw.
And thus do them all over the body, coming from within.
Then treat those warts whose roots are eradicated with that of the ointments which engender flesh.
Here begins the fifty-fourth chapter.
Of the cauterization of tremors.
When it comes to a tremor through rubbing of the nerve or through fever from rubbing, or through another cause like that, then take that you cauterize that with four cauteries, or with v over the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra with one cautery; and cauterize in the feet of him, and on his stomach with a cautery of olive oil.
And if the tremor of him is relaxed and the health of the sickness rubbed, then it is good; but if not, repeat the cautery in those places where the rub is made.
Here begins the fifty-fifth chapter.
Of the cauterization of white spots on the body.
When in the body white spots appear and pustules are split open which are made of coarse corrupt materials, therefore take when it appears that there be cauterized over all head of the fistula with a subtle cautery with a rod of mirtle, the end of which is extended with fire; or with long razors, or with a cautery lentecular.
And sometimes cauterization with garlic is applied at the beginning of expulsion according to this method; and they are not believed, and the superfluity is disrupted by doing those things, and healed from those things.
But it should be done with proper evacuation through phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
Of cautery for the flow of blood accidentally by incision of an artery.
Sometimes there is a flow of blood from an artery that is cut through the wound, or through the incision of an abscess or cautery on the limb, and sometimes they appear similar, and it is difficult to stop that flow.
So when it happens to someone, then you should cover the orifice of the artery with your hand and place your finger on that orifice, and sometimes push that finger inside until the flow of blood is stopped and does not come out again.
Then place on the wound some large and small olive-wood coals, many in number, and blow upon them until they are very hot.
And then take some of those coals, either small or large according to the place and wound in which the artery is broken, pushing them quickly into that vein as soon as you have removed your finger, and hold them there until the blood flow is stopped and that artery is bound up and restricted.
And if the blood is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you remove your finger and tighten the cautery, then take another cautery which has been prepared in the fire, and therefore do not cease doing this one after another until the blood flow is restricted.
And be careful that you do not burn the nerves that are there, and that no other evil comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to restrict the blood in those cases except by one of four methods: either by cautery as we have said, or by extraction if it has not been extracted; for when it is extracted, its extremities are burned and the blood flow restricted; or by being tied with a thread or ligature with strong pressure; or by having remedies placed on it which have the virtue of restricting the blood flow, which should be pressed with a bandage with decent pressure.
But he who applies decent restriction to it by ligature and pressure with a bandage, or by the position of burning causes and similar things, does not confer anything but harm.
But if this happens to someone and the doctor is not present, or medicine, then open with the tip of your finger over the orifice of that vein as we have said before, and understand that it should be pressed with great pressure on him until the blood flow is stopped from the upper part of the wound; and do not remove your finger from over the artery; and sprinkle over it water which has been rubbed with something very cold until the blood is congealed and thickened; and then stop at what needs cautery or medicine.
Of incision and piercing and puncturing and phlebotomy, and of wounds and their likes.
We have already said in the first chapter of all diseases in which cautery with fire is convenient and suitable medicine, its occasions and causes, and the instruments necessary for it and the forms of the cauteries; and we have ordered the chapters from the superior part of the head to the feet.
And we will now proceed in this chapter in that way, so that the seeker may be eased; and then on what he has demanded.
And before we begin that, know that in this chapter there is something of terror which is in the first chapter on cautery.
And be careful about it, for in the operation which is in this chapter there are many times cat evacuation, which is by blood, by which life is lost through sprinkling on the vein or incision of an abscess or opening of a wound or piercing of a stone or similar things. And they are all accompanied by fear and trembling, and in the end death comes to them.
And I warn you that this does not happen to you, for many times it happens due to the manners of men with their many manners of diseases. And there are some who go astray because of their disease and die because of it, and also because of the vehemence of that with which they find themselves in their disease, and because of the length of their disease, and because of the illness itself which signifies death.
And there are those who give it to you in their sleep and say so, hoping for health from that, and whose disease is harmful to them.
And therefore do not consent to anyone who comes to you in this way; and your caution should be greater than their cunning and your greed; and do not presume any cause about it except certain knowledge which verifies it from you, and to whom a praiseworthy outcome comes.
And use it in the cure of all your illnesses from prediction and indication of that to which health is converted; for in that there is aid to you regarding acquisition of fame and memory, praise and glory.
Oh, children, God directs your understanding and does not keep from you his direction and protection; for that is in his hand.
And I have ordered this chapter distinguishing by chapters according to that which precedes in the chapter on cauteries, of the cure of the head to the feet, so that it may be eased for you what you demanded and of which you had need.
Chapter one.
Of the cure of water which is contained in the heads of children.
Know that this disease sometimes happens to children after childbirth when the mother raises her child's head in her arms.
And sometimes because of a hidden cause which is not known.
But I have not seen this disease except in children; and to all of them whom I saw the death came upon, and because of that it was known to me as happening in them.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always enlarged because he could not breastfeed due to the size of his head; and yet the moisture increased inside him until fire came upon him and killed him.
And this moisture is either accumulated between the brain and the bone, or it is accumulated below the bone over the skull.
For if the operation in him is that the moisture is between the brain and the bone and the abscess is small, then you should open in the middle of the head with an incision in the width, and let the length of the incision be two fingers so that the moisture runs out; and this is the form of the spatum:
And if the moisture is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two incisions here according to this way:
And if the moisture is below the bone, a sign of it is that you will see the seams of the head open from end to end, and the water is expelled when you press it with your hand on those openings; and it is not hidden from you. You should open in the middle of the head with three incisions according to this way:
And then pull out all the moisture; and then tighten the incisions with bandages and plasters; and then anoint it on the fifth day, and strengthen the skull with oil, and cure the wound with ointments and poultices, and strengthen the head with equality; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture so that the limb may be comforted and healed.
There is another method of incision that considers the size of the abscess and the collection of pus, as sometimes it is larger at the back of the head, or in front, or on the right or left side; so pay attention to the incision where the abscess appears and the collection of pus, and finish according to what you think is best.
And be careful not to cut the artery and cause a flow of blood and kill the patient by that flow of blood through the evacuation of moisture.
Chapter II.
When it comes to a boil or abscess on the ears or feet, and it is old, and there is no response to the treatment with medicines, then the best cure in this case is to make an incision of those two arteries.
And then, when you want to make an incision where the patient is affected in his head, and approximately rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries become apparent, and then tighten the neck of the patient with some cloth; and consider where the pulse is, and the places above each side of the ears are pressed down, and they are hidden in some people.
And then mark the artery with a needle, and make an incision on each side with a knife so that it comes through the bone, and do this all around the head.
And if you want, insert the knife below the artery and cut through to the parts above.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers wide, for when a vein is cut, blood rushes out in pulses, which jumps out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear at the touch, then measure from the ear the quantity of three fingers, and mark with a needle, and cut into the bone.
And that which comes out is the amount of wine an ounce. And very little comes out from him, more or less, and all that is according to the amount that appears in the strength of the patient and the filling of the artery in him.
And consider the wound, and therefore if anything remains on the bone that can cause a headache, then cut it out so that an abscess does not develop.
And then strengthen the wound with small feathers and strips of linen cloth, and cure it within until it is healed.
Chapter III.
Of the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When some people suffer from old migraines or abscesses in the temples, due to cold humors and qualities in the eyes, or old, violent headaches similar to those, and are treated with medical remedies without success, then we have found that extraction of the arteries in the temples, or cauterization of those as I have shown is effective.
And the manner of operation and extraction of these is that the patient turns his head to them; and understand the artery in the temple, for it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden in some people by the force of rubbing.
And if it is hidden from you, then tighten the neck of the patient with some cloth; and rub the area with a rough cloth or pour warm water on it until you see the artery clearly. And then take the knife, whose shape is as follows: And then you scrape it gently with that until you reach the artery; and then extract it into the upper parts as far as you can, pulling it out of its sheath and uncovering it from the layers below it, in all directions.
But if the artery is thin, then wrap it with a thread, and make an incision of it from that one part according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened and tightened, and there will be no flow of blood, for if they are not cut, it will not flow.
And then discharge blood from an ounce. within three.
And if the artery is large, then tie it in two places with strong double thread of linen or cords lengthwise, and do not cut it before the hardening of the wound occurs and cause a flow of blood.
And then cut the superfluity which is between two layers; do this in that hour or another hour.
And if you want, cauterize it with a cautery within the bone with a scalpel so that its ends are cut, and it will be in place of that work.
And it is better to do this when the patient has no fever or a cold complexions, for cauterization is of those causes that help to dry up moist humors, and therefore it is better in youth.
And then extract the arteries that are near the site of a previous wound, and let them be wrapped with powdered linen decently made, and then cured with dry medicines that make the flesh dry and with poultices until it is healed.
And if while you operate another vein appears from the artery, then you tie that blood with a thread, or cauterize it, or scrape the site of the wound, and tighten your hand over it so that the blood is restricted. And if none of those causes are present to you, then place your finger over the site so that the blood is coagulated, and moisten the area with very hot water rubbed vigorously until the pain subsides, and tighten according to how it feels.
And what is easier in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize it with this cautery having two points, because you have marked the two sites with a needle, and then burn each one, with fire, until they reach the bone and cut the artery into two places, so that it is lengthened between its ends, for it is not consolidated at all by this cauterization.
And this is the shape of the cautery:
And you wrap the site with a cloth so that it is cauterized. But if it is milder heat than two points is better, for if it is sharp with two points it approaches each other rubbing, and do not cut into the flesh quickly.
Therefore when there is any thickness in those, the heat of the fire is held in those and the flesh is cut more gently.
And this work is better in all works and easier.
And let the space between two points be the quantity of the thickness of the finger.
Chapter IV.
Of the treatment of acute and sharp pains in the ears.
When there are sharp pains and the veins on the top of the head are visible, and medical remedies do not help in that regard, and the face of the patient becomes red and he feels walking as if ants were crawling on him, and his ears are tired, and the heat is intense within him, and the eyes are exhausted by the intensity of tears, the old ones are cured by this operation with a sponge.
And you command the patient to shave the hairs on their forehead, and then inscribe three equal incisions on the forehead, evenly spaced according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure reaches two digits: let the first fissure be evenly spaced according to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a little finger beyond the movement of the eyelashes which are in the tear duct, and the third from the other side.
And be careful of the incision on either side of the arches, and lengthen your hand from the continuation of both mandibles. And if the space between each incision is the quantity of three digits, adjust it.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or dry rags to stop the bleeding with which you dried the blood.
Then insert the spatula of two sharp ends, and this is the shape of the incision: It begins at the temple and goes towards the second incision. Excise all the membrane which is between two incisions with the scalp, and then do the same with the incision on the other side into the second incision. Then place this spatula and insert it into the first incision again, but this time use another instrument called a cutlar, sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
And place the sharp side towards the membrane and the blunt side towards the bone, and move it around so that it reaches the middle incision, and cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the limbs.
Let the incision continue up to the membrane, and then do the same in the middle incision up to the other incision.
And when blood comes out in equal quantity from both sides, squeeze the places of the clotted blood.
Then place in each incision a piece of cotton wool, and place on it powders mixed with wine and oil, and pour onto it vinegar so that no ulcer forms.
And on the third day loosen the ligature and administer a great effusion of tepid water, and then dress the wound with ointment of basilicon mixed with rose oil and other things so that the wounds are healed.
CHAPTER 5:
Of the treatment of ulcers by cauterization and of the ulcers which descend from the parts inside the head.
When the cauteries are done and continued, and one sees the ulcers of the patient become smaller, and the protection of them is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and because of that the hair, and in the brow there is acute pain and intense pulsing, then know from these accidents that the matters and cauteries do not come except from many veins in the parts inside.
And the best treatment for them is this: command the patient to shave his forehead, and then inscribe a fissure in the middle of the forehead, a little according to its length (and begin with the fissure of the left temple going towards the right temple; and let the incision be made into the bone; and lengthen your hand from the eyelashes of the temples which are bitten because of chewing), so that the bone is uncovered.
Dry up all the blood with sponge or dry cloth, and then stuff between the two lips of the fissure cotton wool or lint. And then sprinkle on it powders mixed with wine and oil so that there is not formed an ulcerous cautery.
And when you loosen it and see that the ulcer has become smaller, then know that one should wash the bone so that the meat begins to form on it, and then treat those with an exsiccative regime which causes the meat to wither away, just as if one takes two parts of wheat flour and four parts of gum mastic and mixes them together into a plaster and applies it to these wounds of the flesh at birth.
CHAPTER 6:
Of the treatment of what cauterizes in the ears.
The whole cause which cauterizes in the ears is one of four species, either it is mineral stone or causes something like stone, just as iron and vitriol, or it is plant just as chickpeas or beans, or it is volatile just as water and wine and their likes, or some animal.
And when stone cauterizes in the ear or other cause similar to those causes which do not form a growth in the ear, and hold the ear to the sun, and if one sees the stone, then distill on it some cause of violat oil or sesame oil, and then administer its distillation, and make them sneeze with snuff, and plug the nose because of the sneezing. And then place in the circuit of the ear some pieces of cloth or wool, and lengthen the ear to its parts above, for many times it is bored by these causes.
And if it is not bored, then administer its extraction with the subtle instrument called epicyclical forceps, of which this is the form:
And if it is bored by gesti, let it be; and if not, then administer its extraction with the subtle hook of little duplication.
And if it is not bored by that, then make a cannula of ram and insert the tip of the cannula in the hole of the ear and close over the opening of the cannula with wax and softened oil so that there is not open except the cannula. And then extract it by strong吸引力, for many times troops have been found with this.
But if it is not bored in this way, then take hollow alum or of the type prepared with which the ears are compressed with a little quantity, and place that on the end of the ear, and then wind cloth around it decently placed. And then insert that into the hole of the ear with ease, and then draw out the ear from its moisture.
And if it is not bored by all the causes which we have recounted, then you cut to such an extent that there ensues ulcerous cautery or spasm.
And the way to cut it is that you first make the patient's vein of the septica vein and extract its blood according to the nature of it, and then do that in such a way that there are not two veins in the place where one has been pricked before him, and convert the ear towards its parts above, and pierce with a small incision in the root of the ear because of the grayish color of it at the point which has been pricked before. And let the incision be in the shape of the moon so that it reaches the stone, and if the stone is found, hold it with instruments; and then close the incision at that time with speed, and treat it so that it is healed.
And if the cause cauterizes in the ear is one of the fats which grow and are swollen, then administer its treatment and extraction; but if it does not obey your command, then take the slender tweezers according to this form: And administer with that the incision of that fat which has fallen in the ear.
And do not do that when you think that it has been moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place that in many pieces, and then extract those with forceps or with subtle tweezers, or with incision just as we have said, for the extraction from it is eased.
But when the water which is entered in the ear causes sneezing at the beginning, and fill his ear with some cotton wool, and pour on that ear in which there is the water, and if by that it is bored, let it be; and if not, then take thin stones like fingers according to their length, and heat those in the fire a little, and the patient inserts one of those into the hole of his ear and sucks on the one from which there is the water, and press with another stone over that stone which is in the ear. Therefore do not cease until all the urine has been expelled.
Therefore do not cease until all the urine has been expelled. And when the urine has been expelled, take a piece of paper or linen and place one end in the urethra and extend the other end towards the fire until it burns, the length of it.
And then put in another one and do this as many times as needed until all the urine is expelled, and apply this also with a catheter as already described.
But in the extraction of an object which has entered the urethra, if it is a small object, remove it as we have already said in the section on division; but if the cause is due to a large object that blocks the flow of urine, then use forceps and tongs, and the cause of this is usually a foreign body lodged in the urethra.
But in the extraction of a worm that has grown inside the urethra, if you cannot cure it with what we have already said in the section on division and on the treatment of discharges, then you must look at the urethra under the sunlight.
And if you see the cause of the worm, then remove it with forceps or fine tongs; but if you do not see any cause, then take a catheter that is narrow at the tip and wider towards the end. Insert the narrow tip into the urethra according to how much the patient can tolerate; and then suck strongly with your mouth several times until all the worms are expelled.
But if you cannot access it due to resistance, then stop and close the opening of the catheter with wax as we have already described; then administer the distilling remedies which have been used before in the treatment of worms, and find this also in the section on distillation remedies.
And use this instrument to pour the medicine oils into the urethra; this is how it should be made: Make it of silver or brass, narrow at the tip and wider above, with a small hole in it.
And then stop it up with a plug so that it fits snugly into the opening of the catheter where it is needed. And if you want, take a reed and wrap the end of it with cotton, and then pour oil into the cavity of the instrument, or juice from herbs, or anything you want to use from these medicines in the catheter — and that is how it should be used in the urethra —; then insert the reed with the cotton above it and squeeze with your hand that end of it gently until the oil is expelled into the cavity of the instrument and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what has been inserted in the urethra should be warmed slightly with fire. And be careful that the cause which you distil in the urethra is not too strong, because the medicines for the urethra do not tolerate it.
Chapter 7:
On the treatment of inflammation of the urethra.
Sometimes children are born with an obstruction in their bellies which is not punctured, and this also happens to some adults, with inflammation in the middle of the urethra due to a blockage or from pushing against it; and this inflammation sometimes occurs at the opening of the urethra, and sometimes deeper inside.
And that which occurs in the middle of it, which does not allow urine to pass through, is a more difficult condition to cure.
And if you succeed in allowing urine to pass through, look at the urethra under the sunlight and examine it. And therefore, if you see swelling, open it with a thin spatulum of which this is the shape:
If the end of it is narrow, with one edge sharp and the other not; and let the spatulum be made of two sides of lion skin so that it does not harm the urethra.
And if the inflammation is due to flesh grown in the urethra or in its middle, then cut it with fine tongs and pierce that spot forcefully until all the flesh is removed.
And if the inflammation is in the middle of the urethra, take a thin reed made from lion skin and warm it slightly with fire, then insert that into the middle of the urethra.
And therefore, if you feel swelling due to the difficulty of urination because of obstruction, relieve that pressure easily; and be careful not to harm the nerves of the urethra.
And then place a bandage around the urethra according to the width of the opening which you have wrapped with Egyptian liniment; and do this for several days until you are sure that the plaster has dried out; or take some ash and dip that in water and sprinkle it over the area, and if you see that the urethra is already swollen, then remove the ash and replace it with another kind of ash which you have wrapped in a cerot made from rose oil, until the swelling subsides; and then cure that until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then immerse a sponge or bandage in warm water and place it over the urethra, and use the other treatment which constricts the flow of blood, which is described in the section on distillation remedies.
Chapter 8:
On the cure for athezil which occurs under the eyelids.
Athezil which occurs under the eyelids of humans sometimes produces moisture, and sometimes it is dry.
Therefore, you must have them pulled by tweezers or tongs, and tear them with a spatulum made from their roots, and then place it over the spots after they have been crushed.
But if bleeding occurs with pain, then cauterize them with a small, thin cautery.
And the best cauterization is to make incisions and cuts several times until all causes of those roots are removed; and when they have been cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9:
On the cure for grandeyssa which occurs under the eyelids of humans.
Many times it occurs under the eyelids of humans due to some cause which is similar to grandeyssa in its strength and hardness, and because of that, grandeyssa is called.
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture under the eyelid on top and underneath.
Therefore, the appearance of it is that you must consider if the grandeyssa occurs in it due to something appearing from under the eyelid and is swollen all around; and the cause of it is cold.
Therefore, pierce it with a slit through the width, and then scrape all of that gently until it is released, and then close that with tongs and cauterize it.
And if the figure is large, then adjust it with a suture; and cure that until it is healed.
And if it is small, you will not suffer harm from that because the eye restores it and heals it.
And if the grandeyssa is declining towards the inner parts of the eyelid under its surface, then open it and close that grandeyssa with tongs, or you can cut it, and press all around it, and if the eyelid due to incision is elongated, then this will not be noticed in any cause.
And then begin by washing the wound with salty water, and heal the area with an ointment that will promote healing.
Chapter X.
Of the treatment of a ulcer on the eyelid.
A ulcer is a grayness that is engendered in the membranes of the eyelid, and it mostly affects infants, aggravating the sight of those and causing pain to their eyes; and they cannot bear to look at the brightness of the sun because of this.
And so you will see these children always rubbing their eyes, and sleeping on their faces; and the eyelids of their eyes are moist, covered in inflammation, and there is a sign of swelling within the eye; and when you press on the area with your finger, you feel the swelling within.
And a certain kind of bandage is put on the patient who rests his head on your lap; and you drape cloth over him and make heat from it, and make a circle according to the quantity that contains arterosclerosis from all around, and then place that upon it and press with your fingers all around so that the swelling is reduced in the middle of the circle, and then open in the middle of that moisture with a spatula inserted through the slit, and the slit should not be larger than the one made in flabotomy.
But in the first stage, be sure to cut all the way through to the artery so that you reach the swelling, for in most cases the swelling comes through the slit as a white grayness.
Then extract that with tweezers which you have wrapped between your fingers at the outside edges and twist between the right and left hand so that it is pulled out.
And be sure not to press into the slit with the spatula so that you do not reach the eye and damage it.
But if you do not see the artery at the beginning of the slit, but you can press into the slit a little with ease so that the artery comes out; then extract it as we have said; and then moisten cloth in water and wine and place them over the area and hold them tight with a bandage.
And so some put salt and place it in the cavity of the slit so that what remains of the moisture comes out.
Then heal the area so that it is cured.
But if an ulcer occurs in the eye, then heal it with soft bandages until it is cured.
Chapter XI.
Of ways of touching the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes there are hairs that are pushed downward and are pulled out, then those harm the eye and cause ways of illnesses as well as continuous tears and inflammation of the eyelids and membrane, which is a cause of destruction of the eye called tactinir of the eye, and it can be cured in four ways: by cauterization with fire; or with an acute medicine as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery; or tactinir is caused by incision and suturing; or by cannula, as I will explain.
Then have the patient rest his head on your lap; then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it turns, all is well; if not, insert an awl into the slit where the pus is below the eyelid, and let the awl go above the hairs — close to the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow — close to the hairs, and draw out the pus towards the top of the eyelid, and turn it with your finger.
Then open the slit within the eyelid below the hairs with a spatula inserted into the tear duct from above into the lower tear duct; then extract the pus and place small pieces of cotton or cloth underneath the eyelid, and then bandage over the eyelid with a tent so that it forms the shape of a leaf of mirt.
But let the shape be according to the amount of swelling of the eyelid, for this is diverse in men, for some there is a great quantity that is inserted into the eyelid according to the amount by which the eyelid is inflamed.
Then open with the spatula over the two lines that you have drawn, and begin from the tear duct from above into the lower tear duct. And if your slit is close to the natural hairs, as thick as a king's hair.
Then insert the needle into one of the two angles of the artery, and then scrape away all the inflammation, and then close with a stitch the two lips with gum or fine wool, and wipe away the blood, and attach what overflows from the hairs above two eyebrows with some causes binding, if you wish to do so, and otherwise it will not be cured.
Then let the stitch of the hairs be loose within three or four days, and then heal it.
And if you wish, remove the bandage after the stitch, and heal that with something that dries and constricts, for the eyelid is raised because of the sealing of the bandage and the inflammation of it; but a stitch is better. So therefore we say these things about taxinir.
But let there be rest on the patient, and it is a good operation, and let there not be fear.
There is another way in taxmir, and it is that you mark on the eyelid the shape of a leaf of mirt, and then raise the eyelid with three hooks separated and gathered according to this shape:
But if that is not possible, let the hooks be held, and if it is not straightened, then take an awl in which there is a thread and insert it into the middle of the shape, and insert the other end close to the tear duct, and press between your fingers the hairs with equality, and then with those raise your hand with an equal raising, raise all the area over which it is marked as we have recommended.
Then close the two lips of the wound with a stitch, and heal that so that it is cured.
But if an ulcer occurs because of your incision or slit, heal the ulcer with ointment and bandages similar to it.
And some times it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are turned inward, so then use what we have said about incision; but a stitch in every case is more natural.
Taxinir with cannula is according to this form: And it is that you turn the eyelid and split the figure that is within according to what has been described; and then with skill make two cannulae or two thin probes of which their length is according to the length of the eyelid and their width is less than the width of the spatula. And you have already split at the ends of some of these parts where you have threads.
Then gather each one with subtlety under what overflows of the eyelid of the eye, and press the cannulae in some places with strong pressure, and let it be for several days, for the eyelid because of the pressure will die and become black and fall off when you remove it.
But if it is delayed, then cut it with tweezers, and then heal the wound so that it is cured.
So when it is healed, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not sting.
And this is the form of two cannulae which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Of raising warts by the hole with a needle when the wart is hard.
When the warts are unnatural, hard, rough and painful to the touch, then the operation to be performed on them is to take a thin needle and pierce it into that sensitive spot of the wart very gently, and then tie off its extremities with thread very gently. And let the length of the thread be about the size of a palm.
And then tie another thin thread beneath it quickly, and knot the ends of that one if you wish.
And then let the patient hold his head in your lap, and be near the sun so that your work is revealed, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the wart which has need of skill, and let it penetrate the eyelid rapidly while you pull that one above the natural wart out.
And then pull the wart up from below and insert that into an ointment, and let there be one or two or three warts, and no more.
And then pull your hand away so that the wart is forgotten with the ointment in the eyelid with the natural wart.
But if it is drawn out with the ointment and the wart is not extracted, you shall draw out the ointment to the sides below with the thread which you have tied to it so that in being drawn out, the ointment of the tract remains above.
And wipe that with the vision of the eye, for then you will extract the ointment and the thread, and let each one and close the eye, and leave the clot for two or three days so that the wart adheres to its place and grows over good flesh.
And if the wart is more short, then take a long hair from one of the natural hairs and let it be elevated with that, or let the thread enter so that it is drawn out to some length, and then you elevate that.
Chapter 13.
Of the cure of a wart which comes in the eyelid above.
When a wart comes in the eyelid, and is contraction of the eyelid when it is drawn inwards to one side or the other, through bad consolidation of plague or of scars or of cauterization, and is called leporine, and this wart is either natural or accidental, and is made through consolidation of plague or of scars or cauterization, or through likenesses to them badly cured.
The way of the operation on it is that you split that consolidation and separate its lips, and place in it what is between a fold of linen cloth, and tie those so that they are healed.
And do not think that you use cure of it from the causes which dry up, constrict; for if you do that, it returns with pustule worse than at any time before.
Use in that of causes which soften like fenugreek, and moisten with the water in which there are roots of it, or ointment dyaquilon, which should be liquified with some of the oils, and immerse in that the fold, and cure with that.
And the secret of your cure is that you pierce with complete skill so that it is not consolidated according to its form at the beginning.
And this operation which we have said, is not but some rectification of ehalixacrati which does not return the form of its place according to what it was before.
Chapter 14.
Of the cure of a wart which is made in the eyelid below.
This alxacrati which is made in the eyelid below, which is named veritably alxacrati; and it is of one natural, another accidental.
But accidental is made through plague or through split or cauterization or through other likenesses.
And the way of the operation on it is that you take a needle in which there are double threads, and place that in the flesh, and let it pass from the tear duct on the left into the tear duct on the right, so that the thread comes to both extremities of the flesh.
And then extend the flesh to the sides above with the needle and sew that with the needle, and insert with spatulum ample. And so if it returns the shape of the eyelid according as you wish, well then; and if not, take the needle and place that in the split figure, and with that turn the eyelid, and split the two fissures on the sides of the eyelid below.
And let the extremities of the two fissures be of two angles of the incision which you have made so that they meet, and be made of them an angle between which when they are gathered together is made figure.
And this figure is Greek letter: lambda.
And then stitch the flesh that by the quantity it is the side of it acute below it, that which closes the eyelid.
And then sew those parts separated and heal them with what we have said of the medicines softening and of the poultices so that they are healed.
And if alxacrati comes through split or suture or cauterization, then you shall split with a flat split over the hairs of the eyelid according as it is preceded. And then separate with the poultice between two lips according as we have said.
In the sum of the speech of the cure of alxacrati when it is above or below, let there run in it operation according as it is prepared from the form of alxacrati, and that is in form of many differences.
And the wise artisans prepare skill in every way which is possible to them so that they make return the figure to the natural form or near it, and the patient according as it suits him of the operation and of the instruments in the greater dispositions.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to many men in whom the eyelid is solidified more above with the albumen of the eye, and it is prohibited from the facility of its movement and of its natural works, then you insert the extremity of the needle below the eyelid, and elevate it upwards, or extend that with the nail.
And then you insert the adhesion with spatulum subtle which does not have the sharpness of the incisions, having obtuse a little so that the patient is not disturbed after the operation, and remove the spatulum that it does not hurt the eye by its sharpness.
And let your incision which cuts out that adhesion with facility so that the eyelid is returned according to its natural form and that all the adhesion be healed.
And then you put in the eye salted water with which you wash it; or distill in it zunia dissolved in water.
And then separate between the eyelid and the eye with poultice of linseed, and place over the eye wool infused in albumen of egg, and on the third day use causes consolidating so that it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Of incision of nail and of eminence of flesh of the tear ducts.
Know that the nail is according to two manners; for it is nervous, and is similar to hard chaff subtile; or it is not-nervous, similar to white moisture congealed, which when the iron touches it, or it is forced to take by needle, is cut off and the needle is not placed in it.
And both species do not begin unless from the tear duct major so that there goes little by little covering the view and forbid light and the movement of eye.
The manner of proceeding in the examination is that the patient inclines his head to you, and then you open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand, and then collect the fingernail with tweezers and extend it to the parts above. Then take a needle and insert into it a hair of horse or bullock or cow, or similar, or strong bile, or double the end of the needle little by little and push that into the nail, and pierce with the needle the nail; and extract with bile the nail; and extend that to the parts above, and with the hair scrape the sides of the nail which touches the pupil. And so you follow that with the hair into the back of his eye.
And then you insert the remainder into the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula or small forceps, and cut the flesh of the tear duct naturally so that through its incision it does not cause continuous flow of tears.
And the nail with the sole tweezers extended or with bile, thus as we have said; and then is scraped with a spatula lion whose form this is:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and that it cause rupture in him, and that the pupil be perforated.
Then the incision releases into the eye a little trimmed salt or made of cinammon, and let that remain until the next day; and then cure that with water that covers it so that it may heal.
And if the nail is not nervous and you cannot put the needle into it, or it is not pierced with the tweezers, then many times this kind of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed thus as an eye, and is described in the division.
And if you want to split that, then open the eye of the patient and take a fine spatula lion with file sharpened according to this form: with subtlety. And if you see that it is rarefied and withdrawn and it has taken root in the eye, then distil from your mouth into the eye made of cinammon or with fine roe or with trimmed salt, and cover the eye until the next day.
And then repeat the operation until all that is of it is removed, unless a cautery wound be in the eye, for then you cut that and cure at the beginning the apostema until it heals.
And then repeat your operation on that with reason until it is healed.
The membrane of the tear duct, if noted in the eye from great harm, is suspended with tweezers; and insert that from one part, and do not finish the incision so that it does not cause flow of tears.
And then distil into the tear duct fine roe or made of cinammon until it is healed.
Chapter .xvii.
Of incision of algusardenic and what is born of flesh pressed in the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some people there is born red flesh and it lies on top covering the pupil, or drawn near or stretched out upon the eyelids and strongly press the eyelids to the parts outside and it is attached like a bullet wound.
But the operation on him is that the patient inclines his head to you; and then open his eyes and collect all of that flesh with convenient tweezers for that, and hold that with a forceps or basket; and then cut the flesh at the beginning until it is all finished with the scissors, and be careful of the eye not to injure that after your operation.
And let your incision be with which you cut those or with a spatula which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps with which ashbell is collected according to the form of it; this chapter will tell you.
Then when your incision is completed and all that flesh is withdrawn, then fill the eye with trimmed salt, or distill into it red powder and similar to it of the medicines which are corrosive, and place over the eye outside a piece of eggshell until it is secured from cautery wound.
And if there is any cause of algusardenic and there is lordotic wound cautery, and you fear cautery wound, then cut the eye and cure that wound with what releases that wound; and then repeat on it the operation until it is healed, and similarly do in the flesh which lies upon the eye of this kind.
But however you see that all cure of the eye is done by natural or accidental way, doing with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations unless you see that this member suffers those operations.
Chapter .xviii.
Of collection of ashbell in the eye.
Red veins which are tested upon the eye and prohibit its operation, and they darken the eye over the course of days.
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which there is ashbell is strong and in it there is not another disease than ashbell, then collect that ashbell.
And it is that you command the patient to incline his head to you, and then suspend those veins with one tweezers or two according to your prudence; and let that pair of tweezers be of fine double according to this form:
or so two pairs of tweezers gradually inclining one to the other according to this form:
And then let those veins be collected with fine forces, with subtlety, and wipe the blood now and again, until you see those veins are withdrawn from the eye and are rolled up;
And be careful that you do not injure the eye with the end of the spatula; and if your operation is on the left side before the sun, and keep it firm in your operation and do not pierce except those veins.
And when you have finished, then distill into the eye fine green or roe so that with its sharpness it may corrupt what is withdrawn of the ashbell.
But if it is not possible for you to collect all of that in that hour, then you plaster all with what releases his pain, and let him for several days until his pain is calmed and he is secured from cautery wound.
And then repeat on him according to the manner in which it was healed.
And this is the form of the tweezers:
Chapter .xix.
Of reduction of arizati to the nose.
When you heal arizati with cautery or with acute medicine burning according to the previous narration of it and is not healed, then do not put anything in it except that you open the wound because of its maturity, and extract all the humidity which is in it and the pus until its bone is uncovered.
And then when the bone is uncovered and you see in it corruption or blackness, then scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is formed of rough iron and let the end be rounded thus with a file or ground with a pointed file (thus as in the following form).
And place that over the rotten part of the bone and then roll that between your fingers and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is rasped.
And let that be done several times, and then restore the part with astringent and styptic causes.
Then if the place is consolidated and there is born good flesh in it and the body of the wound has been separated from the sania and he has stood for 40 days, and is not renewed nor cauterized nor happens to him accident, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then it is not in him to open the fracture in the shape of a nose, and according to this manner: and you uncover according to bone with iron or with sharp medicine, and with sir discovered the bone, then you take traction according to this form:
Let the extremity of him be triangularly ironed, and his shaft be first extended within the extremity thus with force as well.
And place that against the bone, and let it be close to the tear; and lengthen your hand a little from the hole, and approximately rotate your hand with traction inside so that all of the bone penetrates, and he feels the patient through his ass that atroba wind to exit through there when you place your hand.
Then restore the site with astringent medicines, drying as you have been taught.
Then when the flesh and the site has hardened, then the matter which flowed out of the orifices is returned to the nose; therefore here is pus upon the patient.
Chapter 20.
Of reduction of the eminence of the hole.
When the hole eminences by its totality and not happens in the movement any damage nor decrease, then you must loosen the patient, and let him follow, and let him pause wind in his neck without scarification and suck through good sucking; and then place over the hole liniment which should be made of astringent and aloe and myrrh and sandaraca, and then strengthen the bandage over the hole with soft words.
And the manner of the words is that you take pieces of linen cloth, and each piece be doubled in four folds; and make from those words.
And then place those one over another according to the quantity of which has the hole necessity. And then strengthen over those with a hard cloth with strong stricture; and iterate the ventouses with sucking without scarification; and stop the ventouses and let him the hole tight both day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament is softened, then you must that it be very tight.
And stop the bandage both day and night as we have said.
And if you see the hole already reduced, good is; and if not, then iterate the bandage with the words and the stricture and the ventouses until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the tunica uvcea.
When disruption in the tunica uvcea, and is eminent and processes out the eyelids thus with a grain of sand, and it is orrazada the form of man by that, and want to that incision, then the operation in him is as we have recommended, that you insert the needle in the root of the uvea of the part below in the part above, and then place the needle another in which is thread double of the part of the tear, and make that penetrate and let the first needle according to its disposition; and then incise the site of the double thread and lift with it the part of the uvea in the circuit of the needle, and strengthen that word.
And then extract the needle and place over the hole wool infused in white vinegar and let it into that the thread falls with the grape.
And then cure the hole with that which comforts that within which the plague is healed.
And some few times gather from all party with circle of cloth within the hole adjust eminence great, and then be perforated by the spatula subtle that comes to the preon of the hole, and run the humidity albugineous, and descend the hole and in so far.
And then strengthen until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Of cure of alconati.
This illness that is called alconati is not but putridity which is adjusted in the hole like water descending and it is not that.
But the manner of doing in it is that you make the patient sit on the seat prepared and straight, and then take his head in your hands of two parts and hold him so that you see the putridity coming to the parts below, and then be dried and not descend, and be obscured the light, and the patient see the causes thus with vision.
And if it does not descend below, know that it is water.
But if not prepared the descent to the putridity with that which we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take spatula subtle and fen him over the panniculus cernent a little from the continuation of the conjunctiva with the tunica cornea in the crown (into the hole whet), until the putridity is pushed out.
Then when it is pushed out, then you distill in the hole water tail in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then be cured by the other causes until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Of the cure of water descending from the hole.
We have already said the species of the water in the division and which suits to pierce with sermo declaring, then that according to health.
Then you make him sit between your hands upon a pillow and tie his hole up, he tightly.
And then place close to the eyelid of his hole your left hand, if the hole in which is the water is the left; or with your right hand, if it is the right.
And then with your right hand take almighty, if the hole is left; or with your left hand, if it is right.
And then place the extremity of almighty close to the crown for the thickness of the thread in the white of the hole from the part of the lesser tear, and then press almighty with force and rotate your hand by that.
And then penetrate in the white of the hole and feel that almighty is already come to seen cause.
And let it be the measure of the way of almighty to the preon the measure of the space which is of the pupil within the end of the blackness, and is the crown of the hole; for you will see with that pupil with the vision of the hole by the clarity of the tunica cornea.
And then place almighty within the site in which is the water, and then you pull it down a little and another, and therefore if the water descend so, then see the patient that on which open his sight so soon, and almighty in his hole.
And then rest a little; therefore if the water is descended, then you rest that another before almighty be pulled out.
And therefore when it is dried and not descend, then you extract almighty with facility, and rotate by that your hand a little to little, and then dissolve in the water a little of salt clear of gemma and wash the hole within; and then place outside the hole cotto or stopa or wool infused in rose oil and vinegar with that the hole.
But us and those who so of our time pause over that eaten by white vinegar.
And if not obeys to you almighty to the instrument of the hole by its hardness — for it is thick one of the men of which the hole is hard word  —, then you make him sit the patient that on which eat by white vinegar.
And then pierce by that conjuncture, and do not finish your hand in the hole, and it is not unless you make way to almighty site subtle.
And then enter almighty according as we have said.
And the completion of your work, it is prepared for the patient's sleeping place, made in a dark room, in which he sleeps on his back, and all movements are prohibited.
And pause in nature for him so that it is clear his nature, and not harm his head at the right or left side at all.
And be the bandage according to his disposition within the third day.
And properly loosen that in that dark room and expose the wound to view, and show him some causes, and then return the bandage within the seventh day.
And not think that you do this in the time of healing or immediately after the infusion. Have care that you displace it so that the water can gently flow through the pipe with ease.
But if it happens to be a boil, then loosen the bandage before the seventh day, and rectify that with water so that the boil will subside.
Then you cover his sight and place over his face a mask by which the movement of him is restrained until he is for several days in that dark room.
And then it should be gradually transferred and conversed about its causes.
And know that in some cases it is not necessary for the disciple to see some things, and then you are anxious about the operation.
And now it has come to us from some of those who are in the Artach , and some say that they made fire in Ayrac Magdaam by which water is sucked.
But indeed I have not seen it in our land, nor is it read of in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the species of Magdaam for which there is one upon those who ignore them:
And they are made of iron or steel properly, and their ends be with this subtlety triangularly, the acute end thus with that is the shape.
Chapter XXIV.
Of the cure of a wound in the nose.
When in the nose there are grown diverse meats joined of which is some cause that is assembled to scorpion of mots, or polyp, and this illness is called polypus because it is like that peep represented. And from him it is cancerous meat, scaly, of dusky colour; and from him it is that it is meat of lion not of dusky colour.
Therefore in that which is in these meats not fraudulent or cancerous, do so the patient open between your fingers and placed in the sun, and open the nose of him, and pierce the tip of the finger in those meats. And then extract that to the forepart, and then you will see that which has been understood from those with a sharp instrument of the one part into which you know that all the meat is removed; for if there remains in him any cause for which the abscission is possible, then you rate that with one of the subtle instruments with facility into which he has not remained any cause. But if it is lorded over with blood or there is a boil, then you place to him that which you will; or if it is of the malignant boils, then cut and cauterize that into which bleeding is abscinded and all the caves are open.
And then it shall be removed from the nose, when the incision is made, with wine and water or vinegar. But if the nose is open and from it proceeds moisture into the palate, then you know that it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate according to that which you do, then you know that inside him is meat in the pus sub-bones of the nose to which no abscission has been arrived.
Therefore then do so you interpose bile to him of which there is any grossness, and in him move mots, nuts, and pause between each nut the quantity of the finger or less, and enjoin the patient and interpose one end of the bile in the nose with the ray or another cause by which it is possible to him.
And after that which has been done, let him throw his breath into that which arrives at the canals of the nose, and be breathed over his gullet, for troops like this seem to do this action, and it is a slight cause to that which he wants to do.
And then pause the two ends of the bile, one end that goes over the nose and another which goes into the nose, and then administer a scissor of meat with the nuts that are in the bile, and do so until you know that the meat is removed from the nuts of the bile.
And then pull out the bile, and pause in the nose the abstraction of blood a sponge , and do so for three days or more until the gum has corroded all that which is separated from the meats.
And then at the end of the cause, pause in the nose a cannula of lead for several days until it is healed.
But if you find that the cure is exhausted, use that.
And this is the form of the instrument to head-purger with which oils and medicines are distilled in the nose:
And do so from silver or iron, which is like a little open lamp, likewise with a little hole, and the meat similarly.
And if you want, make a cannula closed likewise with cane, and the cannula of the instrument to head-purger and be flat, uncovered; to which is handle in his arse, with which you have that when you heat in him oil or water that you want of the sucks and the causes.
Chapter XXV.
Of the yls in the ends of the nose.
Many times it is born theyl in the ends of the nose, and is magnified and swollen for several days until what is stopped to him.
And because of that you insert that in the commencement of the appearance of him, and withdraw it altogether. And then pause over the place or cautery or medicine burning which is in the place of him.
But if the incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider whether it is suppuration, hard, of dusky colour and of little feeling, then do not touch that with iron because it is boil; for many times to that which you insert this suppuration becomes great malice on him who had.
And if the boil is of the colour not dusky and there is incision possible in all that, then evacuate the patient and insert that without fear, and bind it around until it is healed.
Chapter XXVI.
Of the suture of the nose and of the lips and of the ear when the connection is dissolved by water or like.
Know that when there happens solution of continuity in one of these cartilages, few confer in that operation unless in some men.
Therefore do so when also for some cause of those that you consider whether it is fresh water with his blood, and then join the two lips of the wound with suture, and then heal that until it is healed.
And if the lips of the wound have already been separated and each has healed, then you must scrape away any dead flesh from the wound so that it may bleed. Then, tie the two lips of the wound together tightly and put on powdered dragon's blood and crushed aspen wood over it, then apply a layer of diafinicon plaster or one of the other consolidative plasters, and leave it on for two or three days, then remove that plaster and replace it with another, and leave it on until the flesh has healed naturally.
But the manner of the suture is to bring the wound together or with needles as we have recommended in the suture of the belly, or bring the wound together with thread in such a way that you and your assistant know how it was done.
Chapter .XXVII.
Of the extraction of those causes that come from both lips within the wounds.
Many times in these wounds between the lips of men you will find certain hard bumps resembling grains of ergot, and some are small while others are large.
Therefore, you must turn the lips inside out and cut into each of those hard bumps from all sides, then fill the wound with powdered sage until the bleeding is stopped, then wash the wound with wine vinegar and treat it with something astringent until it is healed.
Chapter .XXVIII.
Of incision of the flesh pressed against the gums.
Often there is flesh pressed against the gums, which the ancients called albus, so you must lift that up with a hook or what you have there, and cut it at its root, and let the pus flow out or the blood.
Then place powdered sage or other astringent or drying powders on the wound.
And if that flesh comes back, cut it again secondly, and cauterize it, because then the cautery will not let it come back.
Chapter .XXIX.
Of reason of teeth with iron.
When there are rough, sharp sores on the surface of the teeth in the wounds and holes between the gums and also within the gums, some are black and are made yellow or green by corruption of the gum and the teeth are made loose.
Therefore, you must put the patient between your knees and hold his head in place, and pull the teeth in which those sores appear and the causes seem like sand so that no cause remains inside them, and this removes the blackness and yellowing and others until they are cleansed.
Therefore, if that is the end of what is in the beginning of the root, then that is good; but if not, then you must go back over the root on those teeth again and again on the second and third day until it reaches the final state that you want.
And know that teeth have many needs for various tools of different shapes according to how they are prepared for your operation. And therefore the file with which the tooth is filed for the wound between the teeth is another type of file than that used to file between the teeth according to other forms, and you should prepare those types of files which you will see immediately.
Chapter .XXX.
Of extraction of teeth.
You must cure the tooth of its pain by all means and delay at all costs in complete extraction of it, because there is no cause that exceeds the appearance of it when it has been extracted, for it is a subtle substance that is an obstacle in its extraction.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, then you must be certain which is the painful tooth, for many times the pain deceives the patient and it appears to be in a healthy tooth, and you extract it and yet the pain does not cease until the painful tooth has been extracted, because we have seen this through the operation of the barbarians.
Therefore, when you are certain which is the painful tooth and that you know it, then you must scrape around the circuit of the tooth with a spatular in which there is some virtue so that it dissolves the tooth from the gum entirely all around, and then pull it out by its roots with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little until you loosen it.
And then grab it tightly with strong fingers or strong pliers, and hold the patient's head steady so that he does not move, and pull the tooth according to the right method so that you do not break it or give the patient greater pain.
And if there is a cavity, then take one of those instruments and put it below the tooth from all sides with ease and force the extraction of it just as it was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or hollow, then you must fill that crack with a piece of cloth and squeeze it with the end of a thin rod so that it is not broken when you tighten it on it with your fingers.
And you must open it widely with a scarification around the circuit of all parts of the gum and be very careful that you do not break it or tear it apart, and return to the patient because the first pain of it is great.
And be careful that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and audacity in the extraction of them, for they do not follow what we have recommended; because many times they bring great illnesses on men which are very difficult to cure, and their roots are all worn away or some of them, or that you extract it with certain bones of the jaw just as we have tested.
And then the extraction of it should be washed with wine cauterium or vinegar with salt.
And if blood flows out of it, therefore, as we have said before, take some quantity of salt and sprinkle it on the wound, and if that salt does not stop the bleeding, cauterize it.
The shape of the forceps and thin tongs with which the tooth is extracted at the beginning should be long, narrow-tipped and thick, so that they do not bend when you operate with them.
And let them also be as wide of handle in the middle so that when you tighten them they do not bend, they should be short in length.
And let them be made of Indian iron forged and hammered, and in their tips be teeth with which the others bite into each other and tighten with a strong descent, and sometimes the tips of those are the shape of the beak of an owl, so it is hooked, and they are of strong constriction.
Chapter .XXXI.
Of extraction of teeth and the dislocation of the bones of the jaws that are broken.
When you must extract a tooth that is broken due to some cause, then you should hold the wound closed with a bandage for one or two days until the wound is softened; and then use the instrument or forceps whose tips are joined together like the beak of an owl or hooked, the shape of the forceps:
Their tips should be made with pliers or a file.
And if it does not obey you with those forceps or tongs, then you should cut into the root and strip away all the flesh and put in the instrument called the lever, which is a short lever whose shape is as follows:
Let there be a small one of short thickness, and not so wet that it is not broken.
Therefore if through this the vein is cut, it is good; and if not, use some other instrument of which these are the forms: The form of the first instrument is triangular in its extremity, and in which there should be some thickness.
The shape of the second instrument is that it should have a triangular and very fine point.
And now you are helped with this instrument having two spikes, and whose form is as follows: and with other instruments which are used in pulling teeth; for it is done with this instrument which is like the jaw of a large animal, and this is its form:
of the triangular bent point, short or curved, and in which there should be some thickness, and not wet enough to break.
And another wisdom is that the instruments of the teeth move and are like other instruments.
But the wise and subtle artist will find for himself many ways according to what he learns from the operation and various illnesses; for there are various illnesses which the ancients did not describe or use proper instruments for because of their different shapes.
But if the bone of the jaw or other bones in the mouth are broken, then the foot must be cured where it is convenient with some of those instruments and forceps which we mentioned in the extraction of teeth roots, and use the action for which this is the form:
And some thickness must be applied little by little, and the hole held closed with the mouth so that it does not open or escape until all the bone is healed; then restore the area with appropriate medicines for this.
But if it is a small fracture, then cut away the fracture and the blackness from it, and cure the area inside until it is healed.
Chapter XXXII.
Of the cure of teeth protruding above others.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural shape, and especially when they do so in women, and especially in older women, then you should consider: if the tooth is next to another tooth and there is no way of closing or binding it, then cut it; but if the tooth is next to another tooth, then drill it with this instrument whose form is like a pig's jaw, and which is made from Indian steel with a very fine point.
And your drilling should be such that you drill it for several days according to the hardness of the tooth, and that none of the other teeth are harmed.
And if the protruding tooth is worn away by grinding, then grind it with an Indian steel file whose form is as follows:
And all of it is made from Indian steel, and the point is very fine; and it is like small needles, and with the file which is used to make needles, the tooth is ground little by little over several days with ease, so that no other tooth is harmed or worn away. Then line it at the end, and cut it with a very sharp razor.
And if the tooth of which one side is broken and cuts the tongue, then you should grind it until that fracture is flattened and rounded off, so that the tongue is not cut nor the speech impaired.
Chapter XXXIII.
Of restoring broken teeth with gold or silver foil.
When teeth are knocked out and broken due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot chew, and your cure with styptic medicines has not helped, then in order that they do not rot, they must be strengthened with gold foil rather than silver, for silver turns black and rots within a few days, but gold never changes.
And the foil should be so fine and thick according to how much can fit between the teeth; and the form of the repair is that you take the foil and place twice as much between two healthy teeth, and then it grows with two curves of the foil between two broken teeth, or if one or more are broken, until it reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. Then repeat the bonding inside at the break from which you started, and strengthen your work with ease and skill so that none of it is broken.
And your bonding should be such that you bond the foil so that it does not open at the roots of the teeth.
Then cut away the excess foil with tweezers or pliers, and add those to each location with action, and cover them over and conceal them between the healthy tooth and the broken tooth, so that they do not harm the tongue. Then let it be bound thus tightly with thread.
But if it is loose or torn, strengthen it or those with another foil in the same way at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the repair of two healthy teeth and two broken teeth, as they are bound thus:
And when one or two teeth fall out and return to their places, and are regrow thus as we have described, and rot again:
Then let it not be done except by a wise artist.
And sometimes it is appropriate to use some cause of cow bones, and it is made in the form of a tooth, and placed in the hole from which the tooth fell out, and strengthened as we have said, and remain and serve with that for a long time.
Chapter XXXIV.
Of the cutting of the ligature which appears in the tongue, and prohibited speech.
This ligature which appears under the tongue sometimes naturally, or accidentally occurs due to a blow which has already healed.
And the operation is to open the mouth of the patient, and lift up his jaw bone which is under his tongue; and then insert that nervous ligament according to its breadth so that the tongue is released from its binding.
But if there is any hardness or knotting in it, and that is due to the hardening of a blow, then you cut and split it according to its breadth so that you have split the ligament and the knot is dissolved.
And be careful that there is not any fissure in the flesh of the jaw, and that you split only the membrane, and there is a flow of blood.
Then let it be washed with vinegar or with sour wine, and then place the tongue in its socket, so that there is a wound which the patient does not close so that it is not healed again.
But if blood flows, then place a piece of charred wood over the hole; but if the blood stops, then cauterize the hole with a cautery which is appropriate for this. Then let it be cured by the other causes until it is healed.
Chapter XXXV.
Of the extraction of a ranula under the tongue.
Sometimes there occurs under the tongue an abscess which resembles a small lump, and it prevents the tongue from its natural movement, and when it is enlarged and fills the mouth:
And the operation is to open the mouth of the patient and examine the abscess.
And if you see it of a dusky or black colour, hard, to which the patient does not respond with feeling, then do not touch it for it is rotten.
And if it is white, and moist, then place the tip of the needle in it, and split it with a very fine point; and if blood flows while you are operating, then pause over it with charred wood, so that the blood is stopped.
And then return to your task, washing the wound with wine and salt, and treat it with another ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Of the extraction of an abscess from both ears, and that which occurs in the throat, and of other abscesses.
When there is swelling in the throat, there are glands which are united like cotton, and which become enlarged and are called two ears; when you treat them with what we have said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider whether the abscess is hard, of dusky color, and of little feeling; then touch it not with iron.
And if it is of red color and the root is large, then touch it not with iron through the flow of blood; before you let that be matured, either you will pierce that or it will burst by itself.
And if it is of white color, soft and the root of it subtle, then that one is to be incised.
And the operation upon it is that you consider, before your operation, whether the abscess has rested with complete rest or if it has diminished by any diminution; and then let the patient lie before the sun, his head in your lap, and open his mouth, and the servant take hold of his tongue with his hands, away from the instrument most noble of which this is the form:
And it shall be made of silver or of bronze, and it shall be subtle like a needle.
Therefore when you press with that the tongue and it is shown to you the abscess, and put upon that your instrument, then take hold of it and insert that into the hole outward as far as you can. Another one is that you pull on some of the membranes; then incision that with an instrument of which this is the form:
Another one is that you pull on some of the membranes; then incision that with an instrument of which this is the form: and it is like tweezers, except that the ends of it are curved so that the openings of each one is in the direction of the other, very sharp, and it shall be made of iron tempered hard.
But if this instrument is not present to you, then incision that with spatulum of which this is the form: And it shall be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have incised one part, incision the other according to this manner of incision, and then let the patient recuperate from water rubbed on.
But if there ensues a flow of blood, recuperate with water of decoction of husk of pomegranate or leaf of mallow, and similar to that from the causes constrictive until the flow of blood is restrained, and then cure that until it is healed.
And sometimes in the throat there are other abscesses other than those two ears; and incision them according to what you see and say in the incision of two parts alike.
And I was once treating a woman of an abscess which was occurring in her throat; and that abscess was of dusky color, of little feeling, which had closed her throat, and the woman was breathing with difficulty, and she had prohibited eating and drinking water, and she was brought to the point of death unless she had stood for one or two days.
And that abscess had grown so much that it had made two holes through which pus was flowing.
Therefore I cut the throat carefully and put in one of them a probe, and drew out that pus and a great part of it, and then I incision the other side from where I understood the other tract; and then I opened the mouth of him, and grasped his tongue, and then I put the probe into that abscess.
And then I cut out a great part of it, and there flowed from it only a little blood. Therefore the throat of that woman was completely opened, and she began at once to drink water, and then to take food; therefore I did not cease to incision that abscess many times for a long time, and an abscess succeeded in place of that one which I incision until it was prolonged.
Therefore I had the throat of her cauterized and then sewed it up, therefore from that I walked around and did not know what God made of that one.
Chapter 37.
Of incision of membrane when it is abscessed.
When catarrh occurs in the uvula, and it is abscessed and is long, then it is named perpendicular; and if it is at its lower part thick and round, then it is named buba.
But when it is healed with what you have said in the division and your treatment does not confer, and then there occurs that the abscess cauterized is last from her and is subtle; and if it is to that length and is bloody, of dusky color or black, and is not to him sensible, then beware that you incision it for in that one is fear over the patient.
And when you see that according to the manner that I have said of its whiteness and length, then make the patient lie down and press his tongue with an instrument of which you have described the form, and then put the probe in the new one, and draw that downward and incision it with one of two instruments of which you have said in the incision of two parts.
And beware that you incision it except what is adjusted over the natural term for addition, for if you incision from it more, you will break his speech.
And then the incision, use what we have recommended in the incision of two parts, and cure that one until it is healed.
But if the patient was frightened by the incision of him, beware that you use gentleness in the cauterization of him without fear, and the manner of the cautery in him is only with sharp water; and it shall be that you lay the head of the patient in your lap, and then press his tongue with the instrument which we have said, and then take of the water which we have said in the chapter of cauterization, and confer with that live cause, and pause that not thick nor subtle, and of that fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the form:
Let the end of it be hollow in which is paused the medicine as with the concavity of spoon of ray; and pause the instrument with the medicine over the uvula, and the patient let lie on his side so that flow saliva or mucilage of the mouth of him because no any cause descend over the throat of him and that it thaws that.
And then hold your hand with the medicine, and express that over the uvula for the space of a half hour until you see that to be blackened and dulled by the biting of the medicine.
And if you wish, take thread and wrap that over the end of the ray; and immerse the thread in the medicine and insert the ray with the thread into a cannula of above so that the thread adheres in that cannula, and do that as many times until you accomplish what you wish of the cauterization of the grape, and then let it dry that for three or four days.
And if indigestions that repeat the medicine, repeat that, and then the cauterization cleanse in the circuit of the grape with thread immersed in wine, and cleanse with that what is in the circuit of it of the medicine; and be washed with rubbed water, and be cured with ointment, and teeth with remedies until it is healed.
And this kind of cure is more safe than incision and longer lasting in terms of fear.
Sometimes the uvula is cured by something more subtle than cauterization and incision; it is cured by sub-fumigation in this way: take calamus, hyssop, oregano, rue, Arabic thistles, camomile, bromides, and similar ingredients from among the herbs, and prepare all of those things, or some of them, in a bowl, and let them be submerged in agreeably sour wine, and let the wine boil; and let the bowl be properly luted, and let there be a hole in the middle of the bowl through which an appropriately-shaped instrument made of silver or copper is placed; it should be made of silver or copper.
And the end of this instrument is inserted into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the uvula over the glottis, as the uvula becomes very fogged up.
And you should repeat this several times until it is dry; be careful not to perform this cure during the beginning of an appetite for food, because it will increase the appetite too much; rather, you should wait until after he has eaten something.
But if you do not have this instrument available, then take a reed and attach some wool to its end, so that the patient's mouth is filled, because the wool prevents the steam from burning the mouth.
And this cure is good for health.
Chapter 38.
On the extraction of thorns and what adheres in the gullet, and other causes.
Many times there are adherences in the gullet or a thorn in the throat or some other cause.
Therefore, you should extract whatever is visible there, by pressing the tongue with an instrument in front of the sun, so that what is in the throat will be revealed to you.
And if what is hidden in the throat is not apparent to you, then make the patient vomit before the food has digested in the stomach; because often the cause of an obstruction in the gullet is thrown up by vomiting; or the patient should swallow a piece of soap or a piece of lettuce stem or a piece of dry bread; or he could take a piece of dried sea sponge, and chew it hard while spitting out the saliva, and then press his throat with your hand, because when this reaches the place where there are thorns, they will come out. Or take an eel and chew it with vinegar, and let it be inside the mouth and spit it out; or take a pig's ear and chew it and then spit it out.
But if they are not dislodged by the causes we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in the following shape:
And the point should be made with a plucker, and the point should be larger than the rest of it; and in the end of it there should be a concavity which you insert into his throat with ease.
And let him hold his head up, and be careful not to touch the bone of his throat, so that it does not push against the bone or the thorn, or that the doctor with his hand.
But let the patient himself put it in, according to his knowledge of where the obstruction is located and let him press down from above, and pull up the instrument with his hand, according to the amount by which he is prepared for it to be dislodged.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of blood clots from the gullet.
When blood clots are treated with what we have said in the division of cures by medicines and not by cauterization, then look to the gullet of the patient from above, as you press his tongue with an instrument which we recommended.
Therefore if you see the blood clot, extract it with a small needle or with very fine tweezers, gently and decently.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a hollow reed and insert it into the patient's gullet, and then place a red hot iron in the concavity of the reed, and do this as many times as necessary (as long as the blood clot is dead and comes out of his throat), and let the patient abstain from drinking water for the whole day.
And then take a rag wet with water, and wipe his mouth with it; and do not spit out any of the water and let him sip the water little by little with his hand, because the blood clot will come right away when he feels the water.
But if it is not dislodged by what we have recommended, then sub-fumigate the patient with camphor or asafoetida through the instrument which we recommended in the sub-fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, as long as it is necessary.
And there is another way of operating with sub-fumigation: take a bowl in which are burning coals and the bowl should be covered with a cloth in the middle of which there is a hole, and fix the end of the instrument in that hole; then do the sub-fumigation; and let the patient close his mouth over the end of the reed, so that the sub-fumigation does not escape as long as you know that the sub-fumigation has reached the blood clot, because the blood clot will come right away.
And if it does not come out, then repeat the sub-fumigation many times; and let the patient abstain from drinking, and eat salty causes and alms, and do not drink water; and if this treatment is followed, then the blood clot will be dislodged.
And this is the form of the instrument with which blood clots are extracted from the gullet when they are seen; and it is similar to tweezers except for the fact that there is some curvature in it. This should be inserted into the gullet, and its end is similar to a stork's beak, which is hooked, so that when it grasps something, it does not let go; therefore, when you press on some cause, it will not slip.
Chapter 40.
In which is the sum of the tongue in regard to obstructions and their sections.
Obstruction are of many kinds, according to what is remembered by us in this book.
And they are diverse in their penetration and sections by two methods: the first is by the nature of obstructions themselves; and by what we understand from moisture.
And the second method is by the places where they occur: for example, an obstruction that accidentally occurs in the head is different from one that accidentally occurs in the anus; and an obstruction that occurs in a fleshy part is different from one that occurs in a joint; and each of them is treated by operation.
And there are some obstructions which do not need to be penetrated, but only the maturation of the pus in them or the completion of them.
There are also obstructions which do not need to be punctured but only the maturation of the pus in them or their completion: or they are near a joint, for when an obstruction occurs near a joint, its nature is prolonged by the parts around it and it strongly corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint; or it is near the main member, so if you delay its penetration until it matures, then it will corrupt the main member; or it is near the anus, so do not puncture it until it matures. May you know the time of the piercing of the pustule, and that is when it has matured.
And you will know that it has matured when there is a lessening of the pain and fever, and also a decrease in redness and pulse, and a sharp point to the head of the pustule, and other signs.
And you will know that the piercing has been successful when it occurs in the lowest place of the pustule and pus comes out from the healing of the prominence.
And the piercing should always be done along the length of the skin or body, if the pustules are on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet, and in places of the veins, nerves, or arteries; and, finally, in any place where there is no reflection; for in those places where there is a reflection, use piercing according to that member.
But when the pustule is on fleshy tissue, it is better to let the piercing be done within it as it has been stated; for if you pierce that which precedes it, the body of it is prolonged and the pus flows out from it along with a lot of thick matter, and its lips are hardened and the depth of it.
But some pustules should be pierced according to the width of the skin or body, depending on the necessity, or according to that member from which one suffers.
And you must administer a small piercing on the smaller pustules, and for the larger pustules, a large and ample piercing or many piercings according to the variety of their sizes.
And there are others that are pustules in which the cord is hollow and has been cut, when it is done so that a pan is made from it, that is, as much as one can make from a horse's hoof, or from a bullock's hoof, or even more.
And there are those that are cut with a three-pronged incision, and there is one in which it is cut like the shape of a fern leaf, just as the pustules on the angles of the nose.
And there are those in which a round incision and a moon-shaped one is administered, and they are similar to those.
But if it does not happen like that with superficial pustules, then you must pierce that one with a superficial piercing, or a flat one only.
And when the pustule is large and has already collected a lot of pus, pierce that one and do not be afraid to extract all of its pus at that time; first draw out some from it, then plug up the pustule until the next day, then draw out a larger portion, then do this many times according to its degree until it is fully drained.
And especially if the patient is of cold nature, or a woman in labor, or a small child, or an old person in weakness, for the animal spirit is many times resolved by the discharge of pus, and soon dies after, then you operate on them.
Therefore, keep this chapter with great caution, and when you pierce those pustules, wash the sores, and then consider if the sore of the pustule is little, or is a flat section, then you administer the remedies of lead or of red copper; and if the pustule is large, and its fissures are many, then you must pause the needle in each crack as they come out together.
And if in the pustule a part of the cord is abscised or you have hollowed it out all around, then you must complete it with old lead, or with thread made from linen or from lead cloth, just as when one treats pans or roots, without moisture; and strengthen that one on the third day; and then process and cure it with what one uses to heal sores.
But if blood flows in the hour of your operation, then you must administer water mixed with vinegar and wine in which a cloth of lead has been soaked, and place that over the location of the flow of blood many times.
But if the flow of blood persists, then you must administer remedies and cures and powders which I have mentioned in many places in this book and its divisions.
But if it is in the winter time, and the location of the pustule is the site of many nerves, then you must mix powder with wine and oil that is hot, and place those on the locations.
And if it is in the summer, and the locations are fleshy, then you must place powders that have been moistened with water and oil or wine and oil on them; and let all of this be done until the third day, just as we have said, and then you must dissolve the pustule and wash it and administer to its cure whatever is convenient for it.
And that is what is necessary for the knowledge of the cure of pustules universally, but according to the way of distinction I have already said about every pustule in which manner is the way of its cure specifically.
Chapter 41
Of the section of pustules that come in the cord of the head.
In the cord of the head are small pustules, and they are of the nature of joints which contain membranes that are to them attached; and their nature is varied.
And from them are bumps, and from those are those that contain moisture similar to lime. And from those are ones that contain moisture similar to powder, and they resemble them in appearance; and from those are ones that are scaly and hard.
And in the section of all of them, and in the extraction of those there is no fear, just as when one extracts thorns, it does not contradict the artery.
And the operation in the section of those is that you express them with an instrument whose shape you see here, the one which is called entremes, as long as you know what it contains.
For if that which it contains is moisture, then split that one with a section according to its length by a superficial section according to this form:
And begin the section at line .B to line .G. Therefore, when the moisture has been discharged, then you will scrape that one from which that moisture was evacuated, and do not leave any cause of it behind, for returning many times, if any cause remains.
And then immerse it in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in water and salt; and fill that with the sore, and let it remain until the next day, for by doing so you will corrode all that remains of that membrane.
And then apply ointment on that one again and again if it needs it, until you are confident that no cause of that membrane remains; then cure the sore with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pustule contains a fatty nodule, then you must insert that one according to this form: by section having the form of a crook, and cut the edges between the two lips of the section and scrape that one from all around, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane which contains that one.
But if your artery causes a contradiction, then do what I have told you before.
And similarly do in the pustule that is lapified by section and cure according to what I have told you before; and section on pustule that is lapified is pus-like, for it is of little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these pustules in the head of some people in whom there is no moisture; and their cause is that one who has struck on a pustule in the head of an old woman and blocked the pustule with a hard, rough, white pebble, which could not be broken, and if he strikes it, it bleeds.
But with other swellings that appear on the head other than this one, which is not in this chapter, such as swellings that come to the heads of infants and behind the ears, the incision of all of these should be superficial.
And make the incision from the lower part of them so that the body is relieved from the disease in the lower parts.
Then treat those with what is appropriate for that kind of treatment.
Chapter 42.
Of the incision of scrofula which occurs on the neck.
These swellings often appear on the neck and armpits and elbows; and sometimes they appear in other parts of the body.
And those that appear on the neck, and many of them are engendered among themselves, and all scrofula of these is within their own tunic, and so with the nodes and swellings of the head, as we have already described.
And the species of these scrofula are many; some of them are stony, and some contain moisture, and some are malignant and do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that which you see of good disposition in the Touching, of which the color of that which is manifest is similar to the color of the skin, and is swollen in all parts, and is not annexed by the nerve of the neck, nor by the veins, nor by the artery, and is not deep, then you should investigate that with a superficial cut of the part above to the part below the body of the line of G. between the line of B., and scrape that from all parts, and extend two lips of the skin with your fingernails, or with many nails if you have need of those, as we have said in the swellings of the head, and extract that little by little.
And it is more careful that the vein or nerve not be cut.
And let the spatula not be very sharp, so that you do not touch your hand with cutting, or disturb the patient, and cut what is not necessary to cut; for if you cut a vein or artery and forbid yourself from your operation, then stop in the wound vinegar tripe or other powders which stop blood fluxes, and tighten the wound, and let that which rests be rested the acuteness of the swelling and let the wound be softened and begin to become pus. When the blood is cut off.
Therefore return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then inquire with your finger if there is any cause of the other little scrofula; therefore cut those and cleanse them.
And if in the root of the great scrofula is a vein, then you should not cut that scrofula from its root. Before, let that be lifted with strong thread and let it be left until it falls by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton which you have already immersed in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut that scrofula all the way through, then you should bring together the two lips of the wound and suck at once, so that no superfluity remains.
But if you see that there has been superfluity due to the size of the scrofula, then you should understand cutting its root, and opening that and administering cauterization and what is said.
And of those scrofula that contain moisture, pierce that with a superficial incision where it appears to you the place of its maturity, and make an incision of that which is the bottom of the body, as we have said.
Then administer cauterization, with ointment and bandages to those, so that it corrodes what is broken of the corruption. And then when you see the wound already cleansed, then treat that with generative flesh ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Of the incision of the pimple of the swelling within the throat.
The ancients spoke of this incision in the epiglottis, and I have not seen any man in our land who that has been done to him.
And this is the inscription of the word of those.
But in men who have squintiness, so that the extraction of the epiglottis is avoided, as it is not made a cure so that all the veins and the major ones of the patient are here.
But in those who have swellings hot in the mouth or throat or two ears, when the disease is not in the gullet, there use the incision of the epiglottis to avoid the loss which is made by piercing.
Therefore, when we want this, let us cut the epiglottis below three circles of the circles of the epiglottis, or four with small incision for the breadth in that which is between two circles by quantity; let the incision be in the membrane, not in the cartilage, and that location is convenient to incision, because it is deprived of flesh, and the vessels of blood from him are open.
And if the patient is fearful, then let him extend the skin of the throat with his fingernail, and then split the skin so that he comes to the gullet, but avoid the blood vessels if he sees from those any cause.
Then cut the cricoid according to what we have recommended; and it is signified over the incision of the gullet by the flame which comes out from that which is from him broken and by the abrasion of the voice.
And let the wound remain open for some time.
Therefore when the hour is healed in which piercing is feared, bring together two lips of the skin of the wound, and sew that only over the cartilage.
Then administer medicines which make flesh to grow within so that it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the sum of the word which we have recommended, exposure is not unless you see some of those swellings have oppressed the throat of the patient, and the patient has come into death, and his breath is choked, and some go to cut the epiglottis so that the patient breathes the breath over the location of the wound by any respiration, and he is saved from death.
And for that command to leave the wound open until the wickedness of the disease is consumed; and the wickedness of it is for three days; and then therefore command to sew the wound, and treat that within so that it is healed.
And that which I have seen by my physicians is that one servant press a knife into his throat and cut in there a part of the pipe of the lung, and he was called to the cure of him, and choked the breath so as it is choked of the dead, and opened the wound and choked the blood which was coming from the wound.
Therefore he confessed that that had not cut a vein nor artery, and the wind issued from the wound, and he treated that within so that fire was healed.
And I did not believe the servant unless he had put his finger into his throat, and then after some days he returned to the place of his dispositions.
Now I say that in the incision of the epiglottis there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Of incision over swelling which occurs in the throat, and it is called hernia of the throat.
This swelling named hernia of the throat is great swelling according to the color of the body, and it happens in women.
And there are two types of gout, one that is natural or accidental.
The natural type cannot be cured.
The accidental type occurs in two forms; one is like fatty nodules and the other is like an abscess caused by a nodule of an artery, and there is fear with that one. And one should not make an incision on him with a knife except in the case where it is small. And examine him and if you find it like a fatty nodule and not attached to any of the veins, then open that up just like the nodes and remove everything inside from the skin and bursa; but if it is examined throughout his entire being and it is cured by what remedy goes inside so that it may heal.
Chapter 45.
Of the sections of the types of nodules.
There are many types of nodules, and I have already described all of their types in the division.
And one should thus account for the difference between a nodule and an ulcer as long as there is doubt.
Therefore I say that with an ulcer there is heat, fever and violent pains until the ebullition of the superfluity ceases; it is completed putrefaction, and then the fever, pain and heat cease as well.
But with a nodule, there is no heat or fever or pain, and it contains that which the lion has in its throat, a proper sac.
And they are according to the color of the body, and their origin is with a hernia, and they are made in such a way that it can be major or minor; and they are of two types: either fatty and containing moisture, and the colors of moisture are many, according to what I described in the division.
Therefore, when one arrives at the cure of nodules, he should probe and investigate it to its origin with an instrument that is called an introme, according to its form in the chapter that is next.
And it is the method of investigation of ulcers and all nodules; take this instrument and insert it into the most moist part of the ulcer, and rotate your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the membrane.
Then close your hand according to the size of the ulcer and extract the instrument and consider what has come out in its wake.
And if moist matter of any color comes out, then open it up with a superficial incision as I have said for the other ulcers.
And if you do not get moisture from the instrument's passage, then know that it is fatty.
And dry it out with an incision in the shape of a cross according to this form: In the same way that it is taught, and suspend it with pins, and scrape away the membrane from every part with ease, and guard the skin or sac, if you can, on it, and extract that pus with the nodule.
But if it is broken in the operation and it is not possible to extract that pus all at once, then take it in bits so that no cause remains within him.
Because if any cause remains within him, a little or a lot, the nodule will return according to the most.
And if you see that some little part remains within him, then complete the wound with some powdered caustic and strengthen the wound, and place over it what creates an ulcer cautery, and cure it by another remedy until it is healed.
And if it is a large nodule, then cut its two lips and cure it with that which incarnates.
But if the vein is pulsatile or not, then cut and pour into that place a mixture of three parts vetiver oil and one part lye, and let it rest for two days or three until the mixture hardens; then return to opening what is broken in the nodule.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of the necessary instruments for incision and piercing.
Of those are the forms of the intromes, and they are of three types: one is large, and of them is medium-sized, and of them is small.
The form of the large introme is as follows:
The form of the small introme is as follows:
They are made of iron, of hollowed-out copper, of pointed ends bent properly, so that the instrument pierces into ulcers.
And these are the forms of the experiments, and they are called albur, and one of them is called berid.
And they are of three types: one is large, medium-sized and small.
The form of the large experiment, its shape is:
The form of the medium-sized experiment, its shape is:
The form of the small experiment, its shape is:
They are convenient for ulcers and exitwulas and pustules and sores caused by bones or other causes.
And they are made round, large, like a lion's tooth, with large needles with which the membranes are sewn, and they are made of rammon citrine, or of rammon or iron, or of silver, and the best ones are when made of rammon citrine.
And they are made of black lead, and which agree that through them are openings in the cavities where there is a reflection, which are reflected by their elevation with those reflections.
And they are of three types: some are long, and some medium-sized, and some are short, according to the amount of the width of the ulcer and the tightness of it.
Form of the large experiment of lead:
Form of the medium-sized experiment of lead:
Form of the small experiment of lead:
The forms of pins are of many types, and some are simple, which have only one curve, and they are of three types: large, small and medium-sized.
And their bodies are pinched, and they are of three types.
And some of them are pinched having two curves, and they are of three types.
And some of them have three curves, and they are of three types.
And all those are necessary in their place.
Form of a small simple pin, its shape is:
Form of a large one having two curves: Form of a medium-sized one having two curves: Form of a small one having two curves:
Form of a large one having three curves:
Form of a medium-sized one having three curves:
And these are the forms of knives with which they cut and pierce nodules and ulcers, and they are of three types: one is large, medium-sized and small.
Form of a large knife:
Form of the medium-sized knife:
Form of a small knife:
And the edges of those with which incision is made are sharp and the others not-sharp, and they are not stopped in such a way, but to be done gently in the scraping away of nodules by fear of piercing of vein or nerve, and for them is healed the sore and gained tranquility by little due to the scorching which gains the excoriation of the ulcer.
These are the forms of bandages, which are of three kinds: large, medium and small, just as you will see.
They are made of wool and only look like silk with which it is made alcohol.
And is on the outside covered with a needle and thread and on that side it goes inside and out, as you want, just as you see.
The forms of sponges, which are hidden between the fingers on both sides of the punctured abscess and do not hurt the patient, and they are of three kinds: large, medium and small. And these are the forms of them:
The forms of cups with which the flow of blood is stopped, and they are of three kinds: large, medium and small. The form of them is:
They are made of yellow wax, round with some length, and thin.
And that these kinds of leeches are great, medium and small, because with them you stop the flow of blood with speed in necessity, and then when there is no medicine at first.
However, do not use them to stop bleeding in any part of the body, and only use them on fleshy parts, such as on the soles of the feet and on the thighs, and on the flesh of the arms, and on the breasts and belly and the groin, and similar to them in the fleshy parts.
And some of these instruments are made small like slices of figs according to this form; by which blood is stopped when it is done by phlebotomy or incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round according to this form:
Chapter 47.
Of the cure of the breasts of men which are resembling women's.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are swollen because of the habit of sleeping as they begin to be hairy, and then the breasts become swollen and resembling women's breasts, and firm.
And for whoever has this, cut them with a lunar section according to this form, from line B to line G, and then scrape away all the swelling, and fill the wound with an embodied medicine, and then sew closed the two lips of the wound, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the breast declines towards the sides and is softened by its weight just like a woman's, then cut it in two along its middle with two sections resembling a lunar figure, of which each contains the other because of their end, so that the major line contains the minor according to this form from line B to line G. And then scrape away the cord which is between the two lips of the wound, and the fatness, and apply what we have said about the sewing and powders that are necessary in the cure until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of what must be cut for the uneasiness of the patient and for the flow of blood, then fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it there until it corrodes what is rotten from the swelling, and then cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of puncturing abscesses that come below the nipple.
Those abscesses which come below the nipple are of the kinds of scrofulas, hard, and they contain a bag which is sac-like.
And some of them contain moisture; and those that contain moisture should be punctured with a lunar section according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all the contents of the abscess are evacuated, then fill it with old vinegar and leave it for another day.
And then the wound is stopped and cured with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess of the kinds of knots and scrofulas is, then you cut it according to what we have said in the section on scrofulas with gnawing.
But if the wound is extended into something that causes burning pain, then apply to it a cautery according to what we have already said about it.
Chapter 49.
Of the section of abscesses that occur through an artery or vein.
When an artery is broken and the vein is collapsed on it, then many times abscess occurs: for when the abscess is through an artery, it is longly aggregated in the bowels of the body; and when it is forced into the abscess with the fingers, you feel a quack in it that there is stridor.
And what is through a vein is round to the surface of the body.
And the section on this abscess is difficult, and especially in that which is below the armpits, and in the angle, and in the neck, and in many parts of the body; and it is large, therefore its cure by cautery is avoided, and that which is at the extremities, or to the head, must be avoided.
But for that which is from them by inflammation of the orifice of the artery, cut it in the vein with a long section; and then open the section with nails, and the artery, and free the tunics so that they are discovered.
And then place over it an awl and make it penetrate to the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, — which causes you to press on it in extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
And then puncture the place which is between two membranes with a needle so that blood flows out from it all that is in it, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then apply cure to which is engendered pus within so that the membranes fall, and then cure it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess from the section of a vein, then you must hold with your hand what is possible to you of the abscess with the vein, and then insert the awl below the place which you have held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and there will be in it double thread within so that you draw out that from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a fine thread according to what we have said to you in the thread of two parts with two extremities.
But if you fear that the thread is drawn out, then insert the awl so that it penetrates all the abscess because of the first puncture of the awl, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in its middle part so that when it is soaked what is in it, then you cut the superfluity of the vein, and leave what from it is tied.
And then pause over it powder which you have soaked in wine and oil, and then apply the cure which is made with water and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 50 of the abscess which occurs by twisting of nerves.
Just as abscess occurs in an artery and vein, and similarly abscess occurs in nerves when they occur in their compression or occur by superfluous beating, and similarly.
And it is made of them in the places of the helpers or of the talus, or in any place where the joints are crushed.
And it is a heavy pustule, and it is similar in color to the rest of the body, and there are six of them on his arms, and when they are pressed with force, the patient appears to be in a stupor.
And it is not a pustule located in the chest area, but rather below the neck, and he is sick all over, and he does not want to go forward or backward.
Therefore, for those who have pain in their joints, it is not advisable to use a hot iron, because it would quickly cause contraction.
But for those who have pain in the head or forehead, apply a spatulum on the neck. But if there are few pustules, then cut them out with forceps at their roots.
And if it is large, then open it with a knife, and remove the pus; and close the wound with stitches, and heal it so that it may recover.
Chapter 11:
Of the incision of a pustule which happens to the jaw and happens in the stomach.
Some people have many warts on their stomachs and other parts of their bodies, which are called warts because they resemble fungi, the roots of which are fine but the tops are thick; sometimes their lips are also affected, and they can be either small or become very large.
And I have seen one such person whose two warts in his stomach were very similar to fungi; their roots were fine and they were not different in color.
And sometimes the lips of these people turn inside out and split open, and moisture runs from them all the time.
Therefore, when I cut into one of these, I found that it was about an inch and a half deep. The other was about an inch deep.
And when you cut into them, consider whether the patient is hot or cold, and if the color of the tissue is white, then cut it with a wide knife, and let it be cauterized in the fire, for many times the pus is expelled through the incision; and if blood comes out, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient is fearful and anxious, do not cut it with a hot iron; but rather take some fresh pitch, and spread it on that area, in the manner we have described; and let it rest for two days.
Then tighten the pitch around the thread; therefore, do not stop tightening the large thread around it until it is completely cut off and falls away by itself.
But if the wart has a thick root, then cutting it will cause fear and terror, especially when it is in the stomach.
But you may cut only half of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Then heal the wound so that the wound recovers.
And beware of cutting a wart which is dark in color, has little sensation, and seems to be very firm, for that one is cancerous.
And I have seen many such warts, just like cranes.
Chapter 12:
On the treatment of an umbilical hernia.
Umbdominal hernias are caused by many things; or by fissures in the diaphragm above the stomach, and the tissue or intestine of which they are made goes into other openings; or by blood coming from a vein or artery in front, or by restricted expansion in it.
But if it is from a fissure in the diaphragm and from an injury to the tissue, then the pustule will be of similar color to the rest of the body; it will have less pain, and it will appear at various locations. And if it is from a hernia of the intestine, then its location will be as we have described before, with greater and more violent diversity; and when you press on it with your fingers, it hides away, and soon returns; and it becomes very large because of internal heat and violent effort.
But if it is from moisture, then there will be pain, and it will not hide when you press on it with your fingers, nor be constricted or cut off.
And if it is from blood, then the pustule will appear with dark-inclining marks.
But if it is from fat, then it will be a heavy, large and hard pustule, and it will be according to a certain amount.
And if it is from expansion, then touching it will cause pain.
And the operation on it is that you should consider whether the umbilical hernia is from blood of an artery or vein, or from expansion; then you must not use the cure for it as we have instructed in the chapter where we spoke about hernias from arteries and veins.
And if the umbilical hernia is from the intestine or tissue, then you must tell the patient to hold his breath and be standing upright; then touch around the whole circumference of the umbilicus, and then command him to push his stomach out towards your hands over his chest, and then cut the hernia open at its highest point with a wide knife all the way around where you have touched it with the tip; then extend the opening to the sides above it with a large needle; and then tie it all the way around with strong pitch or strong thread in a decent manner.
Then open the hernia wide over the wound and put your finger into that hole and feel for the intestine; and if you have it caught or trapped by the ligature, then cut off the hernial sac and push out the intestine to the sides inside the abdomen.
And if you have caught the tissue, then take it with a needle; and cut away its excesses.
But if it is against an artery or vein, then surround it a lot and then return to your operation; and take two needles and put them in strong pitch and insert two needles around the hernia in the shape of crosses, making them penetrate; then tighten the hernia into four parts over the needles.
And if you want to, take away the needles and leave that place where the extended flesh is shrinking in and falling by itself; or cut it when it has become fine and is shrinking in, and then heal it with what covers it inside so that it may recover.
And if the umbilical hernia is from fat in it or moisture, then you must hollow out the pustule as we have said and draw away the blood or moisture which you find in it; then heal it with what covers it inside so that it may be consolidated.
Chapter 13:
On the treatment of a hernia.
We have already said, in the division, about the kind of hernia and how it is treated with remedies, and that it is difficult to treat a hernia with an iron without causing an ulcer; we have also spoken about a hernia generated from the mother and the caution in treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes a hernia can be in a place where its removal is possible, like a hernia which is in the breasts or in the thighs and which resembles the limbs attached to drawing out all of it, especially when it starts small.
But when it is old and large, you must not come near it, for I have not seen any such hernia recover from that.
And the operation on it is when it has been located as we have said, that you must precede and cut away the patient and purge them from black bile, then bind that hernia, if there is a manifest herniation discovered.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he will be operated on, and cut off all the nails of his toes; and then with a good sharp knife cut deeply into the tissue all around so that no cause remains from the roots. And let the blood flow freely without stopping it; and then squeeze out all of it from the wound by pressing with your hand or an instrument that you can manage, according to which instrument is available to you.
But if you are facing difficulties with the blood flowing from a vein or an artery, then cauterize that area so that the flow of blood is stopped; and then treat it with another treatment so that it heals.
Chapter .liv.
Of the treatment for dropsy.
We have already described, in the division, of the species of dropsy and the signs of each species; of the treatment for it with medicines.
And the one which is cured with iron is only the species of "althitas", and it is not approach iron for the species of tympany or of iposarca because they are deadly.
And when you have treated this species of dropsy timpanistre with medicines and it does not respond to your treatment, then consider; because if the patient is already weakened, or has another malady like another dropsy, as if it is in the chest or abdomen and similar to those, then beware that you do not treat it with iron, because there is danger in this.
But if you see the patient has robust vigour and does not have another malady except dropsy, and he is neither an infant nor elderly, then the manner of operating on him is that you raise the patient between your hands and press his abdomen with your hand, forcing the water out from under the navel; and then take a hollow thorn according to this form:
It should be of two pointed parts long, of acute extremity like a thorn; but it should have in it some shortness little by little, so that during the operation you do not pass into the intestine and that you take it out.
And then consider if the generation of dropsy is from part of the intestines; because in that case you should lengthen yourself from the navel by the quantity of three fingers at the lower ends, on the right side of him over the navel.
But if the generation of dropsy is from a malady of the liver, then your section should be on the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if it is from a tumour, then your section should be on the right side.
And you must not make your section over the side that the patient wants to lie on so that the superfluities do not flow to that place freely.
And then pierce all around with the instrument and insert into that section, and raise your hand with the thorn between the skin and the bowels, and squeeze it out; and if a nail or a little bit.
And then pierce the bowels so that the thorn reaches the desired place which is where the water is. And then take it out and insert an instrument of which this is the form: And it is like a slender silver tube; made of silver or of brass or of lion’s tooth, to which at the lower end there are two small holes, and on the sides of it three holes: two from one side and one from the other side; and its end is notched according to the manner of a pen, like this:
And at the upper end of it there is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately rises over the instrument, therefore it empties from the water in the momentary quantity; because if you empty more than that which does not happen in the moment, he will soon die by resolution of his animal spirit, or it happens to him five times that is near death.
But it empties according to the quantity of his vigour and according to how you understand the dispositions of the patient from the vigour of his pulse and from its goodness.
And then take out the instrument, and it will retain the water which is the cause because as soon as it is retained by the skin which retains the thorn that is over the bowels, of which we have instructed you to pierce according to this manner.
And then return the instrument on the next day if he can tolerate it, and take out a little bit of water, and do this for several days with fear, and beware of error so that the water does not flow out except a little.
But if you are afraid for the patient, and let out a great quantity of water, then treat him with sweat bath in hot sand, and expose to the sun for a long time; and treat it with drying medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize over the stomach and the tumour and the liver; and in addition to the extraction of the water according to what I have recounted before.
Chapter .lv.
Of the treatment for children whose places of urine are not pierced.
Sometimes, some of the children are born from the womb of their mother and the top of the mixture is not pierced (or it is struck tight or it is not in its place).
Therefore, there must be treatment with piercing of him immediately after he is born with a very fine thorn according to this form:
And then put in the hole a small subtle nail of lead and tie it, and let him for three days or for .iiii.tre.
And when he wants to urinate, he will be stopped up and urinate; and then return that.
And if you do not put in the lead, it is possible that the urine which goes over the place will not open this closure.
But he of whom the hole is tight must be treated with a nail of lead as we have said for several days until it is enlarged.
But those in which the hole is not in its place are swollen, the cause of which is that from those, he who is born and the hole is struck is at the end of the tip of the penis because it cannot urinate into the parts inside, so it raises the penis with his hand to the parts above; and there is no generation for him because the semen cannot come to the mother according to straightness, and it is a very harmful malady.
And the manner of operating on him is that the patient be bent over his chest, and then extend the tip of the penis with your left hand with violent extraction, and insert the tip of the head of the penis of the place of the foreskin with a sharp thorn, like this: or that you pierce any part, so that the middle of him comes like the head of the penis and that the hole falls into the middle place as it should.
And beware of causing blood flow in your operation because sometimes it happens; and stop him with it that you stop the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter .lvi.
Of the white which happens in the foreskin on the head of the penis and of whiteness and blackness and adhesion of the foreskin of the head of the penis.
Sometimes it happens to this white in the penis and is eminence of flesh which is harmful.
And one of them is harmful and another is not harmful.
Non-maligna, you should suspend it with a thread and cut it so that it opens entirely; and then put on it cotton soaked in egyptian unguent; and then he, treat it with unguent every day until he is healed.
And if the ulcer is malignant and discolored, then you should administer cauterization near its beginning and reason.
But if the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis and one part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you should treat the ulcer that is inside first until it is healed; then you can cure the outside part. For when you cure both parts at the same time, there is a risk that they will not heal.
And if you have seen infections in the glans and foreskin that are black and rotten, then you must cut away everything that is discolored and starting to rot or that is already rotten; then apply a poultice over the area made from ground grape seeds and bran sifted through a sieve.
Then treat it with another ointment until it is healed.
But if there is bleeding, then administer lunar cauterization in the following way:
For lunar cautery is beneficial in two ways, for stopping bleeding and for corrupt blood.
And if the glans is eaten away and destroyed completely, then you should insert a lead catheter into the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans (and this adhesion only happens in those whose foreskin is not circumcised; and it happens because of an ulcer or blister) you should cut with a blunt knife until the ligament is dissolved and the glans is separated from every part.
And if it is difficult to separate them gently, then you should cut with a knife some part of the glans and foreskin, for often the foreskin, when it is thin, easily pierces through its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin from the glans with a thread of silk which has been dampened in water so that they do not adhere again.
And let it be healed with quicksilver until it is consolidated.
Chapter .57.
Of the purification of children and of the cure for those who are circumcised.
Circumcision is not a cure for continence like other ulcers; but rather since it comes from our action and will, and its use is especially in children, it is necessary that we assign to it a better operation and easier path so they may more quickly return to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not prescribe circumcision for any of their free people, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only that we have acquired through experience, which cause is that I have seen most of the physicians and surgeons use circumcision and purification with a knife and with torches; they use cauterization with vinegar and incision with the fingernail.
And I have prohibited all these ways and not found better purification with forceps or cauterization with vinegar than with scissors, for often the foreskin escapes above, for the foreskin has two tunics, and the one on top is removed while the one underneath remains; so there is great danger of another incision and pain. And purification which is done by apothecaries, and is digital, that the surgeons use, does not secure the incision at the end of the male member, for it often goes into its hollow.
But in the operation with the fingernail, iron and corruption often result from your operation. And the foreskin of a child is short by nature, and often it happens in such a way that it does not need purification, and I have seen this.
But from the purification that is done with forceps and cauterization with vinegar, I discovered the goodness, for the forceps are of proportional incision, so that the keenness that is above is like the keenness that is below; and therefore when you press your hand in proportion, and you insert it according to a comparison at one time; and compression of the vinegar is made in the shape containing the foreskin of the whole, with which there is no error at all.
And the way of the first operation is that you make the child stand mostly if he is one of those who understand a little, and do not do it unless you tie the vinegar in his penis only, and let him be until another day.
And then make him happy in all those ways that are possible for you to receive his intelligence. And then make him stand between your hands, established and prepared, and do not be afraid; and hide the forceps in your hand or under your foot so that the child does not see those or any of the other instruments.
And then insert your hand into his penis and breathe on the foreskin, and draw it out so that the glans of the penis comes out, and then purify him of what is accumulated in it from dirtiness.
The shape of the forceps for purification, this is the shape:
Let the outside tips not be cut and the inside ones be cut so that the branch of the claw is not cut, and let the length of both keennesses be like the length of two handles equally.
But the mistake in purification is that often all the inner foreskin escapes or some part of it from the incision.
Therefore, you must stretch it from your finger in front of the place of the ulcer and insert it according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then cut off that with a needle and insert it.
But if they have passed three days and the ulcer that is inflated under the penis has not gone down, then you insert that until the ulcer is dried up with cauterization, and cut that off with ease, and insert it according to how you are prepared.
And be careful of the glans of the penis, for it will not hurt him.
And then cure him with that which the ulcer is consolidated from the powders of which we have spoken in the treatise on powders.
And if it is cut off from the foreskin proportionately, and it obeys the parts above, that does not hurt him.
But cure him with that which we have said until he is healed.
Chapter .58.
Of the cure of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by congestion caused by stone or by blood congestion, or by phlegm or by pus, and similar to those of which we have spoken about the ways of cure in the division.
And if that which we have said is not dissolved by water and the cause continues in the patient, then it is necessary to administer an extraction of him by instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver and let the cone be thin, also with a reed of bird feather with a thin rod as long as a palm and a half, to which there is a thin tube at its head.
And the manner of the emission of urine through it is that you take the folded needle and wet in the end of it wool or cotton with good lye; and insert the ends of the needle into the part below the syringe, and cut away with the nail scissors if there is any surplus of the wool, but insert it into the tube with force and with egg white and honey.
And let the patient lie on his back, and pierce his bladder with a piercing needle, and with oil of turpentine, and olive oil and eggs.
And then insert the syringe easily so that it reaches the root of the piercing; and then bend the piercing needle above to the part of the embelic; and then pull the syringe into it; and then pull it in so that it reaches the bladder, and that the patient feels the voided cause, and not according to this order, but the meat in which he went to tortuosity.
And then extend the needle with the wool little by little, because urine seeks wool.
Then expel that and cause urine carefully, and use the syringe; do not cease to do this and use the syringe until the bladder is evacuated and the patient receives some relief.
Chapter .lix.
Of the quality of clysterization of the bladder with camphor and with similar instruments which are appropriate for it.
When there is ulceration or pustule in the bladder, or congealed blood in it, or stasis of pus, and you want to distil water and medicines into it, then let it be done with an instrument which is called camphor, and this is its form:
But if in the end of it is hollow, then it is closed. And in that there are three holes: two from the one part, thus for urine;
In the beginning there is a hollow place into which one puts what is to be infused; and it is according to quantity that one stops up that opening, without addition, so that when any cause is withdrawn from the humidities, it is withdrawn, and when it is expelled far out, with that one stops it up, and when it is expelled far, according to how camphor is made with naphtha in sea battles.
So when you want to inject moisture into the bladder, insert the end of clapcedra in the moisture and pull by that which is pushed out from above; for the moisture is drawn up into the hollow of clapcedra.
And then insert the end of clapcedra into the piercing as we commanded in the syringe; and then pull the moisture with that which you pull it, because that moisture goes at once to the bladder, and the patient feels that.
Subtle form of clyster by which the bladder is clystpered, and this is its form:
And it should be made of silver or brass, the end of which is more pointed and resembling a small feather, and below a tube passes within it.
And then take the bladder of a person, and put into it the moisture which you want to clysterize in the bladder; and then bind that between two with strong ligature with folded needle, and heat that moisture over the fire.
And then insert the end of the clyster into the piercing.
And then squeeze your hand over the bladder with the moisture with pressure descending so that the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
But if the bladder is not at hand, then take a bunch of parsley and make a ring from it; and pierce that all around its roundness; and then insert a strong needle into those holes, as one revolves; and then add the ring so that it is added also like an egg, because you put in that what you want of moisture, oil and water.
And then hold that in the instrument and do by it as you did by the bladder, and express with your hand so that the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter .lx.
Of extraction of stone.
We have already said in the division the species of stone and cure of it with medicines, and the difference between stone engendered in the kidneys and stone engendered in the bladder, and its signs.
And we have said about stone for which cauterization is done with hand, and incision;
And the stone engendered properly in the bladder is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And we will now tell about that with manifest exposition and abbreviation.
Therefore we say that stone engendered in the bladder mostly comes to infants; and of its signs is that urine which emerges from the bladder is like water in its subtlety, and appears in it sand; and the patient rubs his penis, and moves it many times, and then it is erected; and with this there are openings in it.
And the cure of infants of that is that they attain 12 years; and it is difficult to cure in the old. But in the young it is easier for that which is between them.
And of that whose stone is larger and the cure is more distant; and if it is lesser, it is contrary to that.
Therefore when we come to the cure of that, first let us cleanse the patient with a clyster which draws out all the fissure which is in his intestines; for that fissure some times hinders the emission of the stone from inquiry of it.
And then let the patient be pressed on his feet and groan in pain until the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or that it emerges from some place or another.
And then let him do that between his thighs, while the patient's thighs are pushed down below, so that all of the bladder is made to incline downward.
And then draw that out and all of that out from it.
Therefore if you feel the stone in the space, then you stop at once with incision on him.
And if it does not come down completely to your touch, then let you anoint with oil the tip of the middle finger, if the patient is an infant, or the tip of the index finger if he is a youth completed, and insert that into his anus. And from the stone which you are standing next to, take out your dagger. And gently insert it into the neck of the bladder.
Then press gently with your dagger against that area and push out any air trapped inside through the opening that you have cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with their hand, and instruct another assistant to use their right hand to stretch out the intestines upwards, and with their other hand to hold back the rectum which is under the intestines, at the location where the incision is made.
Then insert a sponge, cut into a wedge shape like this: and cut through the rectum and intestines, not in the rectal area but on the left side of the buttock; and make a crosswise incision so that the external opening is wide and the internal one is narrow according to how much space there is for the stone to come out without causing any problems, and no more, because if you push the dagger too hard against the stone it will slip into the rectum.
And be aware that some stones have edges and ridges, making them difficult to remove.
Some are like a grape in shape, round, and easy to remove.
So if it has edges, cut along the fissure.
And if it is not loose, then you should either press down on it or grip it tightly with an instrument with a curved end and prevent the stone from slipping away; or insert under it a thin flexible instrument.
But if you cannot grip it, then make the opening a little wider; and if you see any bleeding, apply powdered vitriol to the cut.
But if there are more than one stone, then at the start you should push your hand towards the mouth of the bladder, and gently insert it; and push in a little bit more if necessary; and do the same if there are more than two stones.
And if the stone is very large, then you should not cut it too much, because one of two things will happen to the patient: either they will die or they will experience continuous dripping of urine, because the wound has not healed properly.
But you should try to push it out by pulling on it with forceps, or by pulling it in pieces with the forceps.
So when you have finished your operation, then fill the wound with cotton wool soaked in aloe and dragon's blood, and stitch it up. And place a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and water, over the wound to prevent any boil from developing.
Then tie up the patient around their waist, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, wash the wound with water and oil, and treat the wound with ointment of diaphoretic and diuretic herbs until it is healed.
But if a boil occurs on the wound, hot and corrosive, and it seems like the blood is frozen in the bladder, and as a result urine cannot pass through (and this is known as the egress of blood with urine), then insert your dagger into the wound and draw out that blood, because if it stays it will cause putrefaction of the bladder.
And wash the wound with sour wine, water and salt, and apply ointment of all kinds to it until it is healed.
And remember at all times during the healing process that you should press both thighs and apply the medicines which are placed on the wound.
And if the stone is small and it is in the middle of the penis, and urination is prohibited, then treat it with what you yourself have discovered to be the cause of the incision; for troops wounded by this treatment are accused of having had an incision, and I have already tried it, and it is that you take a punch tool made of iron felt, of which this is the shape:
with a triangular tip, pointed, attached to a staff.
Then take the penis in your left hand and pull it down so that the stone does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the iron into the penis, pushing easily until the punch reaches the stone. And turn the punch with your hand towards the stone little by little, and when you have made the incision on that side, pierce it from the other side as well; for urine will immediately be absorbed.
Then press your hand over the part of the stone that is outside the penis; for it is relaxed and is prevented from urination by the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not available to you for some reason which prohibits it, then take a hold of the stone from below with one hand, and with the other hand above the stone. Then squeeze the penis between two grips. Then pull it out. Then untie the ligature and clean the congealed blood which is made in the wound.
It is not necessary to tie the stone with a ligature from below, but only so that it does not return to the bladder; and the other ligature above, because when you untie the ligature, the stone will come out immediately, and then the wound will heal.
And for that reason when you tie the ligature above, you should lift the intestines upwards or allow them to fall back into place, and the wound will heal as we have said before.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of stones from women.
A stone in a woman is seldom found.
But if you see any such stone in a woman, then it is difficult to treat it, and it is prohibited for many reasons.
One of them is that women are very sensitive.
And the second is that you cannot find a woman who will tell her husband when she is chaste, or is of the women who have married virgins.
The third is that you cannot find a woman who knows this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision on a stone in women is different from the location of the stone, because it causes fear when cutting.
But if necessity forces you to do so, then take a woman who knows this art, and she will be hard to find.
But if you lack that one, then look for a midwife who is skilled in this art, or a woman who has experience as a midwife of women, or a woman who is an expert in this art.
Then have her present, and instruct her to do everything that you command her to do when she feels the incision on the stone; the cause of this is that if the woman is a virgin, then put your finger in her rear end and grab the stone.
Then if you find it, cut it below your finger, and then instruct her to push down on it.
But if she is not a virgin, then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina and grip the stone; then place her left hand over the bladder, and hold it firmly in place.
Then if you find it, then gently push her vagina towards the openings below, causing the stone to rise up into the opening of the bladder; and place your left hand over the wound, holding it firmly in place.
Then cut into that position on the halfway point of the knee down to the root of the thigh, from whatever side it is that he is lying on, and place the stone in that section, making sure that his leg is not bent under him by the stone.
And the incision should be small at the beginning; and then cut into that section, and if he feels the stone, then cut according to how much he knows the stone will come out of that section.
And know that there are many types of stones: some of those are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and they have bumps.
So you know what kind to cut for according to where you want to cut.
And if you see blood flow, apply ground vitriol to that spot and hold it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation until the stone is out.
And you should prepare some of the instruments that are used in the extraction of stones in men, so that you are helped by them in your operation.
And if you see blood flow and know that the bleeding is from the artery that was cut, then put powder on that spot and tightly constrict it with a bandage, and do not touch it again; leave the stone and do not extract it, for soon the patient will die. And then cure the wound.
So when the sharpness of the bleeding has subsided after a few days and the wound is closed up, then you return to your operation until the stone is out.
Chapter 62.
Of incision on a hernia lump.
A hernia lump is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white membrane that is below the chord of the muscles containing the bowels, and it is named membrane.
And sometimes it is in the subcutaneous tissue that nature has prepared for it in the region of the bowels, so that there is another bowel; and it is the chord of the muscle between the white membrane we mentioned earlier, and it is not anything else but a hernia.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness that happens to the muscles, so that material is poured into them; and sometimes it happens due to a blow made on the muscles.
And this moisture has many colors; the color of it is either inclining towards yellow or blood-red, or red, or it is black and foul, or it is watery white, and that is what is most common.
And the signs by which one knows that this accumulation of water is in the white membrane we mentioned earlier are these: for if it is in the white membrane, then the lump will be round and declining a little towards length like the shape of a bowel, and it will appear on the muscle, because the moisture contains it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in the subcutaneous tissue, then the lump will be round with the end of the bowel and because of this one believes it to be another bowel.
And if the moisture is between the chord of the muscles and the white membrane, then cut under the center.
And when you want to know the color of the moisture, then test it on the lump with a needle tip from which the end is removed; and according to what comes out on the end of the needle, judge what is inside.
So when we come to curing it with iron, then we command that the patient should be phlebotomized if it is possible for you, and have his body bled.
And then let him be re-bandaged over the hernia on any cause a little higher up, and put some bandages underneath it.
And then sit on the left side of him, and command the assistant to follow on his right, who will extend his hand to one side of two inches above the chord of the muscles and at the beginning of the navel.
And then take a broad blade and cut through the chord of the muscles from the middle location towards the length, so that it is near to the point.
And the incision should be made according to a straight line equally distant from the edge that is supposed to be of the membrane of the muscles, so that it comes to the white membrane encompassing it.
And cut it, and observe, and be careful so that you do not cut it; and your incision by which you cut it by section should be hanging by the greater bowel and subtly scrutinize by the incision according to how much is possible for you.
And then pierce the membrane full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the membrane above the parts below it; do not touch the chord of the muscles encompassing it, and cut the membrane in whatever way that is possible for you. And cut it in its entirety or in parts, and especially its sides more subtly, because if you do not scrutinize the incision of it carefully, there is no security that the water will not return.
But if the bowel processes from that hole of its chord in the hour of your operation, then when you will have completed the incision of the membrane, return inside it, and then join the two lips of the chord of the muscles with sutures, and then cure it as well as the other wounds, so that it heals.
And if you find the bowel rotten due to another illness, then see that you ligate the vessels which are over the suspensor, and extract the bowel, and then cure it as we said.
But if the moisture is accumulated in two parts, then know that there are two hernias; therefore cut that part according to how you did it in the other equally; and if it is your opinion that there is one operation, then do it.
And then you will wipe away the blood, and put in the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place over that another wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and expand it over the two muscles and the navel; and place over it doubled bandages and powder, and smear that with ointment which is according to this shape:
and then two bandages are tied and made into a pad of wool according to this appearance; and the extremities are bound with which they are pressed by the groin or with wet wool, and they are tied with constriction in the waistband of the trousers, and one extremity is pressed under the buttocks and the other is pressed at the beginning of the navel, and two extremities over two thighs and two extremities over two armpits, and all constriction is tightened in the waistband of the trousers.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially by cautery instead of incision with iron; and it is that you take thin cautery and cut through the chord of the muscles, and it is ignited according to how we recommended earlier so that the white membrane encompassing the moisture is uncovered, and then you take cautery according to this shape: and it is assembled like the Greek letter.
And then pierce through that membrane, and it is ignited so that all the moisture is driven out.
And then extend the membrane with hooks, and cut it with cautery, and scorch with thin cautery ignited; and cut it according to how it is possible for you so that you eradicate everything; and be careful that the fire does not touch the bowel.
And you should know that this operation is the safest and most remote from blood flow, and better than an operation with a section.
But if there is an abscess or blood flow at the time of sectioning or cauterizing, then you must treat any complication that arises from it with a cure that suits him according to what has been said.
But if the patient is weak and does not hope for a second operation due to its horror, then you should perform a puncture according to what I have recommended; and it is when this is certified that you must, based on what we have said about the significants, conclude that the hernia is watery.
Then you should have the patient lie on his back on a high bed, puncture the abscess in its lowest part with a spatulum, and make the puncture according to the length of the body.
And the opening should be wide enough for all the water to flow out.
Then place a pad over the wound and press it tightly to let the remaining water flow out. Then treat that area until the wound is healed.
But if there is a complication in the discharge of water during that time when you puncture it: and this is not done unless the white membrane at the opening of the wound causes a blockage and prevents the exit of water, then you should insert into the wound a needle or instrument with which the water is extracted from the hydrocele; or apply to the compression of the hernia a small.
And you should know that the water will return and persist for about six months or so; and when it persists, then it should be punctured in the same way as before, for the patient will thus spend his days.
Chapter 63.
Of sectioning on a fleshy hernia and its cure.
Know that in sectioning on this hernia, there is great danger of loss of life in the most favorable circumstances; therefore, I have seen its dismissal and saving through it better.
And I will remember the operation on that one and the properties of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the parts of which the body is composed and are caused by various causes: either by acute acute excess, which is distributed to the body, or by impact.
And its color is according to the color of the body, and there is no pain in it, and it is a heavy abscess.
And when it is very cold, its color is dusky, and it has no feeling.
And sometimes it is caused by a knot in the arteries, and by inflammation of those, thus after perception of it has occurred, or by inflammation of veins.
But that which is caused by inflammation of the arteries is known from the dispersion of the abscess when it is pressed with the fingers; and it does not hurt when touched.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed by any cause because of compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that in this species there will be sectioning on the other flesh; and you must insert the thread of the intestines, and stretch the membrane above them, and cut off the white capsule, and ligate them, and insert the suspensory more than you cut it from all parts of the membrane.
Therefore, if the membrane has already been consolidated with those flesh, then you must extract the membrane and insert it.
And if there is adhesion for any reason of the capsule, or between that which is between the vessels, then you must cut all that adhesion and insert it by a circular incision.
But if there is flesh growth in the area of adhesion which is behind it, then you must insert all that is of it, and extract the membrane as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and treat it with the other cure until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Of the cure of a hernia that is from blood vessels.
Vein is an abscess wrapped in some wrapper similar to growth with softening of the testicles, and it is made difficult by exercise and walking on the patient.
And in the cure of this illness, there is fear from that which is preceded by recall.
However, let us give the operation according to what they do first.
And I say that you should have the patient lie on his back on a high bed; and stretch the suspensory of the testicles below; and hold the thread of the intestines with your fingers at the veins which are proved to be in the scrotum; and let him hold his hands tightly, and extend those with violent extension.
Then insert with a sharp spatulum through a transverse incision in the right side of the vessels until they are uncovered.
And then cut off all that we have said in extraction of the artery which is in the temples.
And then stab it with a needle in which there is a double thread, and hold that in the first of the places where veins occur, and hold another one which is stabbed subsequently in the last of them. And then insert them in the middle place by a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract that which is accumulated of foul and putrid humors.
And then cure the wound with the cure of other wounds in which you want to generate pus for the vessels do not hurt.
But if there is vein in all the vessels, then let the testicles be extracted or that the testicles because of this are cut off from the vessels, so that it is deprived of all nutrition from the incision of the vessels, and that they are withered, or that it is cut off for itself.
Chapter 65.
Of the cure of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is by incision that ends in the capsule extended over the abdomen from the parts of the angles of the navel of the abdomen, because weakening the intestines of that rupture to any of the intestines.
And this rupture is of the capsule or of the incision itself, and there are these two species for various causes: impact, or by wounds, or by crying, or by elevation for some heavy cause, or by similarity.
And the sign of this is that it occurs little by little over a long time, and does not occur suddenly, and there is an abscess under the membrane as the capsule compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it is that when it is by incision of the capsule, because at the beginning makes a violent pain suddenly; and there is an abscess apparently below, and this is by effusion of the intestine, and the body of it outside the openings of the capsule.
And sometimes it is cast out with the intestine by the membrane, and this hernia is called intestinal stranguine.
And sometimes it is caused by swelling, and sometimes there is a crack in the intestine, and here it is retained, and it causes great pain of the patient, and sometimes it causes worse pain when it is pressed.
And in the cure of the species of this illness with iron there is danger, for it must be avoided in that.
The manner of the operation for this is to command the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand to the parts within its cavity if he obeys your instructions, and then he should be bent forward at the waist between your hands, and you should raise up his legs.
Then tie the cord which binds the testicles to the parts above, and cut through the whole length of the cords of the testicles; and place hooks on both lips of the incision according to your instructions for opening the incision with them.
And if it is possible, make the incision according to how much you can manage to have the hernia pushed out through it.
Then cut away all of the tissues which are beneath the cords of the testicles, as long as you can see the hard white membrane covering each part.
Then you should insert your finger into the space that is underneath the testicle, between the white membrane and the membrane of the hernia, and cut away any adhesions you find there at the back of the hernia.
Then pull the cords of the testicles towards you from outside, and while doing so stretch out the white membrane on top with your left hand, and lift up the hernia by the membrane to the edge of the incision; and command an assistant to hold the hernia in place as you dissolve any adhesions behind it using a suitable solution.
And check with your fingers that there is no cause for the intestine being wrapped up in the hard white membrane. But if you find any cause for it in him, then you should send him back to bed.
And pierce through the part below the cords of the testicles by an incision through which blood and pus can flow out as we have recommended before.
And apply a pad soaked in oil and place it over the wound; and apply the stitches we have recommended (and sometimes the white membrane is cauterized as we have said at the incision where there is fear of a flow of blood, for in some cases this happens), and leave the stitches so that they can fall out on their own.
But if it is delayed, then it should be soaked in water and placed over the wound so that it falls out as we have said.
And then heal the wound with the other method of healing wounds when it has healed.
Chapter 66.
Of a hydrocele.
In this hernia I have not seen anyone who has been cured by the application of iron.
And the first thing is that it is done as we have recommended in the hernia which occurs with wine; that is, you should ligate the vessels at the incision there with ease, and then dry up the pus in the region around it as it drains out.
And heal the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the rupture which occurs in the groin.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and the region protrudes.
And there should be no cause for the intestines to enter the groin; and if they do, that is rare; and return them inside at every hour.
But if the time is prolonged, there is an opening in the membrane through which the intestine descends into the membrane; and this happens because of the extension of the membrane at the groin as we have said, which causes it to be stretched out and become soft and swollen, and an abscess forms and protrudes.
And its cure is by cauterization as we have recommended before the description of it.
And sometimes it is cured by iron according to this method: and the patient lies on his stomach between your hands, and then you dry up the rupture of the abscesses which protrude with an incision according to its length within the space of three fingers.
And then tighten up the white membrane which is underneath the cords so that it is uncovered.
And then take a bandage and place it over the protruding part of the membrane, and press it against the abdomen.
And then sew together the two prominent parts at the end of the bandage around the membrane, and adjust them with stitches on both sides.
And then tie off the end of the bandage, and do not cut into the membrane at all, nor extend the hernia, nor any other cause as we have said in the cure for intestinal hernia.
And then heal that with the cure of wounds, and when you have inserted the threads, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is consolidated; because the membrane is contracted and the protrusion of the rupture is reduced.
And cauterization is better in this place, because pus is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
Of the softening of the cords of the testicles.
Sometimes the cords of the testicles in some men are softened because the flesh which is between them is softened, and they lack the necessary strength.
Therefore it is necessary in the cure of him who lies on his stomach according to his condition, and that all the softened cords which are on top of the natural cords be tightened up, and then sew together both lips.
And if you wish, cut off in the beginning the surplus of the softened cords with three or four incisions and with a firm stitch.
And then insert between the stitches; and then heal by the cure of the other wounds until it is healed and the threads have fallen out.
Chapter 69.
Of castration.
You know that castration in our law is forbidden, but it was remembered to me that I should mention it in this book; and it is not necessary for me to remember it except in two ways, one of which is for the sake of the physician when he is questioned about it, so that he knows how to cure it if it happens; and the other way is that we sometimes need castration of other beasts for our young ones, as with horses, oxen, pigs, and similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by strangulation or by incision at an opening.
But when it is done by strangulation, the way to do the operation is that we make the beast lie on its side in water so that his genitals are softened and are long and that they hang down. Then take your hand away so that they are resolved and do not appear beneath the touch.
But in a castration done by incision and cutting, you must hold the animal and squeeze the cord of its testicles with your left hand.
Then lift up the scrotum, and cut into each side with an incision so that two processes can be inserted.
Then cut those so that you have excised them. And do not let any cause be upon the body except for the subtle head which is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better which is done by compression because compression strongly leaves no cause in the testicles that the animal desires coitus.
Then cure the wound until it is healed.
Chapter .lxx.
Of the cure of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is according to two types: the first is when there appears a growth in the cord of the testicles, in that which is between two testicles, the shape of a clitoris in which there are female-like genitals.
And sometimes urine comes from that which is in the cord of the testicles.
But in women there is one kind: and it is that the vulva of the woman on the clitoris is like two testicles of a man, a little bit smaller at the entrance as well as the foreskin of a man and two testicles.
And the cure is of three kinds: two from men and one kind from women. And it is so that you cut into those tight meats until the pressure of that escapes, and then cure those with the cure of other wounds.
And for the second kind of men from which urine comes that is in the cord of the testicles, there is no cure nor operation on him.
Chapter .xxi.
Of léntine and prominent meat from causes in women.
Lentige is strongly tightened over natural causes in that it is and becomes tight, and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it becomes like men's and goes into coitus.
Therefore you must have the superfluity of léntine with your hand or a needle, and cut into it.
And do not cut all the way through, especially in the part of the vein, so that it does not cause a flow of blood.
Then cure that with the cure for wounds until it is healed.
But prominent meat is meat that grows in the womb of the mother and fills it up; it usually comes out at the openings according to the appearance of a tail (and for this reason some first called it "tailed malady"); therefore we cut into it as we cut into léntine, and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter .lxxii.
Of the cure for elephantiasis.
Elephantiasis is when the vulva of a woman is not perforated or has a small hole. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental it is due to a malady which has preceded it, and it is caused by tight meat or subtle swelling or thickness.
And it is caused either in the womb of the mother or in her ribs or in the upper part of her body or in the lower part, and it prohibits coitus and conception and childbirth, and it usually prohibits menstruation as well.
And the diagnosis of it is made by examination of the midwife, if the swelling is apparent, then it is near the vagina; but if it is not apparent, then you seek that out with your fingers or with a rod.
But if the swelling is due to subtle swelling and it is near both labia, then you cut into it and burst it open.
And it is so that you pause over both labia and also pause your fingers indicating the space in between with both hands.
And let the woman be on her back, her legs extended, and then extend both labia with force so that the subtle swelling is broken open and the perforation is opened.
And then take wool and dip it in oil and place it over the wound, and let it be for a day so that the wound is not closed.
But if the swelling is large and thick, then you cut into it with a spatule or with a blade of myrrh.
But if the perforation is due to meat, then suspend that with a needle and cut into it.
And you have the medicines that make the flow of blood stop without biting, like ahacatia and dragon's blood and onions, bound with egg white from an egg.
And then administer a wide lead bandage so that the wound is not loosely closed.
And hold it for some days and administer cold water.
Then it will be cured by the other cure of consolidation until it is healed.
And sometimes accidents happen in the mother's womb with other meats, and then you cut into them according to this way. But if it is due to an abscess in the head, then do not do anything to that abscess in any way.
Chapter .lxxiii.
Of the cure for hemorrhoids and of a tail and of red botul which happen in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are the appearance of orifices of many veins from which flows a continuous flow of blood; and when they are old hemorrhoids and they are like thumbs.
And I have already said in the division of those and their signs, and tell them also which ones receive cure and which do not.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and thumbs when they are in the womb of the mother and do not appear in the feeling, then in those there should be no cure with a needle.
But those which are in the orifices of the mother over which there is feeling, then those that are cured.
And let the woman be in warm water and then extend it with the fingers or with rough cloth, or cut into it with sharp instruments.
And then sprinkle over those the flow of blood from one of the sprinkling powders without biting, like ahacatia and similar to those.
And then let her feet be parched for an hour, and then place it in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then do that which is cooked in a mixture of hemp and pomegranate and walnut shells and similar things.
And take flour of barley and cook that with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with that over its back.
And if the blood is scanty, then boil it; and if not, attach two ventouse, and to the nipples its incision.
And take wool and dip it in juice of yarrow or in juice of marshmallow or in juice of wild celery with cooked wine, and make a plaster with that over the wound; and then cure the wound with unguents until it is healed.
And cure that until it is healed.
Chapter .lxxiv.
Of accidental piercing of the head in the womb.
Here is the translation: And I have already described these diseases, their kinds and symptoms, as well as their treatments in the previous section.
Now I will describe in this treatise the kind of swelling that appears in the body when it is caused by humors, and if you want to know how to perform the operation on it using iron.
Now consider whether the pain of the swelling at its onset is acute with percussion and phlegm and fever, and see if it subsides when you press on it, then do not incise it, but treat it with something that helps to mature the humor until the acuteness of the accident passes.
Now you should make the woman lie down on her side with her hips raised and her back bent, and her feet placed at the lower part of the belly, and let her thighs be spread out, and place her arms below her ears, and hold them there with bandages in a comfortable position.
Then the midwife should stand on the right side and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is dilated, the form of which will depend on the causes that will be discussed next.
Now when you want to administer this instrument, you should lubricate the tip of the womb of the woman, and what goes into the womb from the instrument should not be larger than the size of the womb, and guide the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the size of the womb, then you should place powder on the texture of the opening of the womb so that the insertion of any instrument into the opening of the womb is prohibited.
Now you should pour the liquid that runs through the instrument from above, and let the minister hold the instrument and rotate the liquid while the opening of the womb is dilated.
And when the membrane appears and is touched by hand and is soft and moist, then you should dry its head with a sponge on the tip of the instrument.
And when the humor is discharged, then you should place in the wound a sponge soaked in rose oil or an oily solution with some astringent quality; and place the sponge in the opening of the womb.
And insert a tampon into the womb, and over it a piece of clean wool soaked in water in which there are crushed mallows.
Then it should be treated for two days with an ointment that is appropriate for healing.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed with water in which there is a mixture of honey and water, and then with water in which there is crushed lilies or long aristolchia, and then return to using the ointment.
And if the wound is deep inside the womb, then you should be prohibited from treating it with iron, but instead treat it as we have described in the previous section.
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives how to treat living fetuses when they deviate from their natural shape.
It is necessary that the midwife knows the shape of the natural fetus by its description, and when you see the woman expressing herself from the lower parts and desiring to breathe the air, and being lifted up above what is on top of her, and hastening the exit of the fetus, then you will know that this position is according to nature, and it is the exit of the fetus above its head, and the second one with it or suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord.
Therefore when you see these signs, then the belly of the fetus should be compressed so that the fetus descends gently as if it were descending over its head, and the second one with it, and it is cleansed of those superfluities with good cleansing.
But the one that is contrary to this part is not natural or praiseworthy, for when the fetus exits on its feet and its body exits before its head and its hands, or by its foot, or or its head and hand, or by its belly, and strongly turned towards its neck, and resembling the non-praiseworthy shapes.
It is necessary that the midwife be wise and subtle in all these causes, and that she guard against error and deception.
And I will show you all the figures of those, and what cunning is in them so that it may be understood by that and be placed upon that.
When the fetus exits above its head by natural effort, and it is violent upon the woman and a difficult birth for it, and sees its strength already weakened, then do that, or let the women hold it, and evaporate its moisture with fenugreek powder and with oiled warm water.
Then the midwife should insert her finger with a small sponge and split it with that finger, or dry that with her fingernail while she inserts the sponge into the opening. And press the belly of the woman so that the fetus exits.
But if it does not exit, then let the woman be cleansed with poultice of psyllium and poultice of fenugreek with honey.
And then command it, the midwife, to be compressed and make it vomit with mild medicine; and take its mouth and nose for an hour, because the fetus will exit head-first immediately.
And if both hands of the fetus have exited at the beginning, then you should reduce them with gentle compression little by little. But if it does not obey the instrument, then place the woman on her side and lift its feet up, and then rock the woman from side to side while she is held so that she does not fall due to the rocking.
And if the hands are not bent back and the fetus is dead, then insert those and pull the joint of the fetus or hold the body by its hand with a cloth and pull it equally, for it will exit.
When the fetus exits on its feet, then you should push those up, and then turn the fetus gently, and then hold one of its feet and extend those gently little by little.
But when it has exited between the thighs, then you command it to be expressed, and make it vomit with medicine, for it will exit if God wills.
And if it is not exited with what we have recommended, then return the fetus little by little to its original position, for it will exit with easier exit.
And if it is prohibited by all that we have recommended, then take the poultice of alder and dissolved gum, and beat them both in the mortar with good percussion, and apply them to the moisture of the woman, to the lowest part of her belly. Then do that cut in lukewarm water, while you obtain the hypocondiums.
And when the lower parts of it are loosened, then do to it the fumigation of myrrh and apply that to it below. And when you have done the fumigation for an hour, then do that to rest on a pillow, and then make it vomit and open its mouth, and lift up the lower part of its belly with gentle compression, for the fetus will exit immediately.
Examine the foot laterally, while one of his muscles is stretched. Let it be reduced by flexing his hand; but if you cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and let her go.
And if she cannot go, then let her lie on the bed and strike his thighs with a violent concussion, and administer poultices which are made of mucilaginous herbs.
And if delivery has come on, then let her lie on her back, and study the reduction of the hand, and flex the foot according to its natural shape, and make the woman sneeze and command him to press in upon himself while it is dislocated.
Examine the foot over his shoulder with his muscles expanded and his fascia stretched out behind his mother. Let the midwife take the hand of the foot and twist it little by little, and let that be facilitated.
And when it is and how much it is flexed, then pause over the navel of him that which we have recom-posed of oil and mucilaginous herbs.
And then command him to flex his hand little by little, and when you have done that, then let her lie on one side and command him to be bent over on the right side, and then command him to be pressed in; and make her sneeze with a cold. Exit of the fetus prepared on the side.
When it comes out of the mother according to this manner, consider and then insert your finger inside that it may be evacuated of moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended over his face and neck, then insert that of the plum, so that it may not be retained and delayed.
And then press the fetus into the parts within, so that it may pause according to how you desire, and command the woman to press in on herself several times, and let him be dislocated with easy examination, if God wills it.
Exit of twins or many fetuses. Know that many times twins are born, and some times three or four; but that is strange and difficult to achieve; but the cause of it is nature, and they do not live.
And count those, if they are multiplied, a second one, and they are separated by the navel, distinguish those between the ligament in the navel of each of them; And some times they are dislocated so that it is an easy examination, and sometimes they exit through a non-viable examination as we have recomposed it.
And if they are difficult to deliver and reach what we have said about the non-natural shapes, then you cure them as we have recomposed it.
And if the midwife does what she does with facility and subtlety, and delay, and let it be prepared according to its shape according to how it is to him, bringing about health.
Remembrance of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and are aborted.
Sometimes they are formed in the womb in groups of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even ten, and I have indeed witnessed a woman giving birth to six all formed, whose cause was made through the measurements of the glorious wise ones.
And all that while, let it be in the science of the midwife, how strong she is to that small thing, and then pause at that, with which she comes to that.
Chapter .lxxvi.
On extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you cure the dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medicine and it is not taken out, and you must use cauterization with a hot iron, then consider if the woman is of sound health and has none of the accidents by which there is feared loss over her.
Then let the woman lie on her back over her shoulder, and his head be bent down and his thighs raised up.
And the minister must hold her by two parts, or let her be tied to the bed so that his body may not extend during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you moisten the mouth of his mother with oiled waters and a poultice of alder and of fenugreek and of flaxseed.
And then the midwife takes his hand with those oils and poultices, and then flexes his hand with facility in the mother, and then places his hand upon the place where he can catch the nails of the fetus.
And convenient places for that: then you consider if the fetus is prepared to descend over his head, and then you catch the nails in the joints of him, or in the neck, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or under the beard, or in the armpits, or near the ribs, or below the hip bones.
But if the descending is over his feet, then in the instep, or in the middle of the shins.
And let him catch the nail with his right hand and pause at the bend of it in that place which is between the joints of his left hand, and flexes his hand with facility and catches the nail in any of those places which we have said, so that he may reach the cause bent.
And then pause and catch another nail, or the third one if necessary, so that it may be an attraction together, and not an extension according to its uprightness only.
And let it be flexed to all parts, so that the examination of him is drawn away as it is done in tooth extraction.
And let it be flexed between them so that the extension is softened; and if any part of him is retained, then let the midwife anoint his joints with oil and insert a poultice and twist it upon what is retained.
Then if the part of the fetus is dislocated, then let the nails be removed into that place where it was pushed out; and do that until all the fetus is dislocated.
But if the hand is extracted before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it by flexing him, then let the drape be wrapped around it; and then extract it so that all of it is dislocated, and insert it into the joint of the hand or in the wrist.
And do that you do in the other hand and in both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or there is difficulty in flexing him in examination, or he has watery swelling on his head, then let the midwife insert between the joints aspen with thorns and pierce the head and extract the water, or scrape him with an instrument which is named "scraper", the shape of which will come from the shapes of other instruments in the chapter which comes next.
And similarly, if the fetus is of a large head by nature, then cover it with a cloth, or take it out slowly as we have said; and then pull the bones out with forceps.
And if the head has come out and is stuck at the chest, then it must be cut open so that the moisture in the feet can flow out.
But if it is not complicated or obstructed, then you must push the head in immediately as soon as possible for you.
And if the bottom of the belly is ulcerated or swollen, then cover it so that you pierce where the moisture in it runs.
But if the fetus is above its feet, then the attraction of it is lighter and the direction of it towards the mother's mouth is lighter.
But if it is stuck at the belly and feet, then cover it so that you pull out that with a cloth which you will have wrapped around your hand, and cut open the belly and feet so that what is in them runs out.
But if the other members are out and the head is turned, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then she inserts her hand in the air passage, and encloses the head with that, and pulls it in towards the mother's mouth, and then she inserts a finger or two into it and pulls it with those.
And if the mother's mouth is obstructed by an ulcer which happens to the lip, then it must not be touched there; rather it must be treated with the application of moist warm causes. And administer plasters; and follow the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then it should be turned if possible; and what we have said for the living fetus must be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it must be cut in the thighs and pulled out.
And be sure to leave no cause inside the womb.
And when you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about the cure for ulcers which happen to the mother.
And if blood flow occurs, then use coagulants in waters and administer the other cure.
And I have also seen a woman whose belly contained a dead fetus, and then another burning fire within it, and then the other fire was the living fetus. It happened to her long ago that there was an ulcer in her navel; and it was swollen so that fire opened, and she began to give birth to arms.
And I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I placed on her some plasters of strong attraction, and a bone came out of her, and then after a few days another bone; and I was very astonished that there were bones in the belly.
And so I thought they were the bones of the dead fetus.
Then I healed the wound and pulled many bones out of her, the woman remaining in the same dispositions, and she lived for a long time after that, walking with a little limp.
And I did not consider this anything strange, but rather that in it there is knowledge and aid to what the doctor effects with his hand for cure.
On the forms of the instruments which are necessary to pull out the fetus.
Form of the wound by which the mother is opened:
This is the form of the strain where the lips are pulled, to which strain there are two virtues at both ends of two bowstrings. However this virtue must be made more subtle by compression, and it should be made either of ivory or of wood of box-tree.
And the breadth of each staff is two fingers and the thickness of each is a finger and a half; and in the middle place of the two staffs there are two settings of that staff which have already been fastened, the length of each is a palm and a half, and the breadth of each is two fingers, or a little more.
And these two settings are inserted into the mother's mouth so that it is opened by them when you turn the two said virtues.
Other similar form, but more subtle and longer:
Let it be made of ivory or of box-tree according to the likeness of forceps. However, at the end of it there are two settings like a comb, and the length of those settings is a palm, and the breadth of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with them, then let her lie on her back with her feet hanging down, opening that which is between her thighs. And then open your hand with the instrument just as you do with tongs, according to how much of the opening of the mother's mouth you want the midwife to do what she wants.
The form of wound which the ancients said:
Form of impulsion by which the fetus is pushed:
Form of compression by which the large head is contained:
And it is like forceps whose teeth are at the end, just as teeth of a vice with which it is opened and contained. Form of compression few:
Form of a finger having a thorn:
Form of a finger having two thorns:
Form of a spatula having two ends by which the head is cut off:
Form of two spatulas broad:
All those instruments are exercised, and when they are more numerous and prepared by the artisans, then it is easier for the operation and better for men because of its quantity.
And you should not lack those instruments, because the necessity of them is inexcusable.
On extraction of the placenta:
When the placenta is retained after childbirth, then you should command the woman to retain her breath, and then make her sneeze with force, and if it is not expelled by that, cut it out.
And if not, then you take a bowl and pierce the covering with a hole and stop that wound with herbs opening the mouth of the mother, as well as the calcium and rue and anise and camomile and dried scacade and cassia line and frankincense. All those herbs or some of them are to be soaked in water in the bowl, and stop that over fire.
And then stop a tube of reed in the mother's mouth, and hold it there while the evaporation comes to the hollow of the mother.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the placenta is expelled with speed.
But if that cure is applied and it is not expelled, then command the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or in mallow juice, and then insert that into the navel and probe with it the placenta, and when she has found the placenta, pull it out little by little according to how the mother does not feel strong attraction. Before anything else, ensure that the patient's right and left ribs are easily accessible.
And if the mouth of the mother is constricted, we have already recommended the cure with a snuff and medicine from the oil with herbs.
But if it is not cured by all the causes which we have recommended, then beware that you do not tire yourself out with too much sucking, but rather anoint what comes out of the mouth of the mother with oil and four-drug remedy; for it will make that part soft, dissolved and cured.
But when it becomes rotten, there is a bad odour which rises to the head and stomach, and that harms the patient; therefore smoking medicines and suitable remedies should be administered to counter this.
But some of the ancients have already tried smoking with nase-tort and dry figs.
Form of an instrument by which the woman is smoked, for retention of menstruation and secundine:
It should be made of glass or brass.
And the thin end is placed in her vagina and the wider end over the fire, and the smoking is placed on the embers of the fire.
And let that remain until the smoking is consumed and then repeat another.
For cure of a non-perforated child's anus:
Young children and their anuses, if they are not perforated, become very thin and narrow. Then the midwife should enlarge it with her finger; and if not, enlarge it with a sharp spatula, and beware of touching the foreskin.
Then apply wool soaked in wine and oil over it; and cure that with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is blocked, then insert a cannula for a few days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And it often happens that the anus is blocked by a clot or an abscess; therefore the clot should be cut, and then cured with what we have said about the cure and the lead.
For cure of the fistulas that cause discharge below:
The fistulas that cause discharge near the anus, in the space of the lower part, produce a hard lump from which pus flows out.
And it is a fistula or many.
And when that lump becomes old and corroded by the putrid white or subtle pus, sometimes from some of these fistulas some penetrate.
And those that penetrate are known by what comes out of them by the exit and by windiness; and some have the patient of the exit, and often it comes out of them very strongly.
And some of these fistulas sometimes penetrate into the bladder and into the length of the urethra; and some penetrate the joint of the thigh and into the knob of the hip.
And when you know that the penetrating fistula does not penetrate into the anus, then put your finger in the anus and insert a thin probe of brass or iron into the fistula when it is soft.
But if it is hard, then insert into it a thin probe of lead or horsetail hair so that you feel the probe or the hair in your finger.
And if you feel nothing in it and there is no sign of excretion or windiness or anything coming out, then know that it is not penetrating, and then proceed to the cure.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or into the length of the urethra, then the sign of it is excretion of urine from there and prevention of it so that medicine can consolidate the place.
But if it is penetrating into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and there is pain in the course, then its sign is that the probe goes through there if it does not hurt in the bone, and pain in the course of the part; and there is pus from time to time; and medicine does not help it nor is it healed with ointment.
And in all penetrating fistulas there is not a cure of all, and the cure of them is difficult work of foolish physicians upon which they are settled.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is expected according to what you have described, and that which was seen and tried.
And it is that the patient lies on his back, and raises his legs up over him, with his thighs bent towards his belly, and then insert a probe of lead or iron into the fistula until you know the place where the probe goes through.
And if he feels that around his anus, then let him insert your finger into his anus.
And if you feel the probe already pushed in and discovered to penetrate, also what you feel between your finger and that it stretches or flesh, then know certainly that it is penetrating; and then do not work on it, for there is no cure for that, as we have said.
But some say that it heals in some people.
And for the medicine by which it is expected to heal quickly in him is that you apply cautery subtly according to the width of the fistula, as it has been mentioned, and insert that hot cautery into the fistula until it comes out around the anus; and then repeat that two or three times until you know that all those stretched flesh have become dried like a reed of bird feather.
And then cure that with poultices wrapped in wool until all those flesh have dried up, and then cure it with medicines that generate and consolidate flesh, and if it is healed, well; but if not, then it will not be healed at any time by another cure.
And if the probe goes in but does not penetrate into your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a stretched flesh or swelling, and the fistula goes to where it pierces the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will dry it with the probe, and it will be loose in the fistula at the place where the end of the probe goes through, and by the probe it is loosened and drawn out.
And then clean those flesh which are like a reed of bird feather, and none of the causes remain.
But if blood flows from between you and your probe when you push in those flesh, then the milk that is and of the pus the sharp instrument is cauterized with fire or with sharp medicine, for cautery with fire tightens good flesh: so it is drying of those stretched flesh, and abscission of the blood the drying of the moisture.
And then cure that with poultices wrapped in wool or in cress within which the place is hot, and then cure the wound with hard flesh-generating and consolidating ointments.
And thus medicines in which there is constriction and drying; when then it is restored, then it is healed and does not fear repetition.
But if the fistula already goes through into the foreskin of the anus and is elongated from the superficial part of the body, then insert your finger in the anus and probe it.
And so if you feel resistance and between you and it is veil of membrane or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation on him but according to the way of confidence and hope.
This can be treated in one of three ways: cauterize it as we have said; cut away the skin around the wound and try to find the cavity so that you can enter with your fingers and apply treatment directly; do not cut deeply enough to damage the membrane covering the spine, and let the patient pass wind freely according to his will, so that the swelling in the anus will go down of itself. Then treat it as we have said before, so that it will heal quickly; or enlarge the membrane and open the pustules with a sharp instrument as you cut away the skin around the wound, or with a probe, and clean out the fistulous sores which you find inside by probing; try your best to cure the whole wound by cutting, and if the orifice above is not healed over, and the fistula still drains from near the anus, then it will heal more quickly. And sometimes the fistula is cured in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, it is near the edge of the anus, on the surface of the body, and around the margin of the anus; then take a probe with a pointed end, like a needle for piercing ears, and prepare it in this way:
and insert it into that fistula, wrapped in a piece of wool or linen, and then insert the probe into the fistula until you find its cavity.
But if you feel resistance near the edge of the anus inside, then withdraw the probe from that wound; extract the end of the probe and tie the two ends together, and leave it in place for a day or two; and when you have pierced the membrane with the probe, tighten it around the piercing so that the flesh between the two ends of the probe is squeezed.
Then cure the wound until it is healed and consolidated.
But if the orifice of the fistula is not penetrated, then make it so, in whatever way you are skilled, unless it damages the membrane, for you must not pierce the membrane; and then cure it until it is healed.
The shape of the spatula with which the fistula is split: one end is very sharp and the other blunt, so that you do not pierce what is unnecessary, as we have said.
About stitching up hemorrhoids from which blood flows when they are cut.
There are two types of hemorrhoids: some appear inside the anus like a bunch of grapes, and others look like a bunch of raisins. They are small or large; the blood flows from all of them at some time; they are inside and outside the anus, and at its edges.
But those which are outside the anus are according to the season of less moisture; from these flows water like yellow bile or a little blood with continuous pus; they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you order the patient to sit down and squeeze it until the anus protrudes, so that the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you grab it and hold it with your fingernail or something else which you have; then cut off those roots.
But if the fingernails are not held in them because of their moisture and softness, then take them with rough cloth or a twig or woolen thread, and extract them with your teeth, and then pierce them and sprinkle some powdered herbs on the wound at the point of piercing, so that they may serve instead of cauterization; or cauterize them as described in the chapter on cauterization. Then cure them with the other cure until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey excretion, then cut the patient's anus with a sharp instrument so that it has a small bite; and let him be washed with water which is in the anus until he excretes quickly when he is squeezed.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is looser; take them with your fingernail or something else which you have, and pierce them, and cure them as we have said until they are healed.
And if you see the cut, know that you should give them sutures in this way: take a piece of wool and insert it into the needle, and then extract the hemorrhoids at their tops; then make the needle penetrate the root on the other side, and wrap the two ends of the wool around the needle below the needle, and tie them latitudinally; then tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong grip, and withdraw the needle.
And do this to all of them; cut one and not the others, so that the surplus blood flows from it.
Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerot over the anus, and let him rest. And then let it remain until it is healed; when it is healed, cure them with ointment or some other cure until they are completely healed.
And if they are old and the medicine does not help, then know that you should pierce them with the point of a spatula or your fingernail until they are moist, and let the suppuration occur above them, which prevents their consolidation; then cure them until they are consolidated.
Then you should stop those with a more violent bleeding than the first, until they no longer bleed and are excoriated; then cure them until they are completely healed.
Know that ulcers, which are key, and do not if the body is not red around the color of a nail head; they occur throughout the body and mostly in the lower parts, the feet and the fingers, and through these there is pain.
Then know that it should be pierced where there is a circle around the nail, and held with forceps or something else which you have, and pulled out by its root; then cure it.
And if you wish, cauterize it as described in the previous chapter.
But warts are small rough round pustules on the surface of the body; they often occur in children's hands.
And its treatment is that you stretch and pierce it, or squeeze it with a needle until it pops out. And if you wish, cauterize it as we have said, with fire or sharp medicine.
But a carbuncle is a large pustule on the surface of the body which occurs in the armpits; when it is rubbed, it feels like an insect bite, and it occurs around the body.
And its treatment is to take a cane of reed or of peacock's feather, and make it strong; then place it over the carbuncle until it contains the circle of the cane; then turn your hand around the cane so that you pierce what is in the circle of the carbuncle, and let him squeeze the canule so that he pulls out the root of the carbuncle.
And if you want, make this with a tube of gold or iron in this way:
Let the part above the cannula be thin, smooth (so that it is not perforated), and wrapped so that over the said part the perception of it is abolished and the revolution of that.
And if you want to cauterize the ant according to what is mentioned above in the cautery of atheyl in the chapter on cauteries.
On the shape of the instruments that are administered to give surgery.
Sometimes surgery is done with silver or brass or molten gold or malleable; and sometimes they are made of those instruments small and large according to those to whom they are administered, for that which is administered in the cure of small children should be small; and of those whose anus is sore or painful, the cristiers of these should be small.
The shape of a large and few cristiere:
The head of the cannula above which is tied the pouch should be wide in this way; and there should be a distinction to it where the pouch is tied as well as the veins.
And the extremity of it below, which is inserted into the anus, should be smooth (so that it is not open) very little, preventing subtlety; and on one side of it there are two holes, and on the other side a hole, and the width of the hole according to the thickness of the rays, and the thicker ones smaller.
And the pouch in which are placed the medicines of a beast's bladder or sheep's wool, and its length be one palm.
And it should be perforated with many holes as it is rolled; and if the space between the holes, the thickness of the said instrument.
And then insert into those holes strong bile of raw bile which should be from twelve biles, or surround them with it; and when it is tied to him, the pouch, let it be tightly tied at the head of the cristiere between two distinctions with a strong constriction, and then cauterize with that each hole: But the quality of cauterizing with that is that you fill the pouch with medicine, which should be warmed according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance; and beware that it is not too cold or too hot.
And then the patient should lie on his back, and raise his legs up and place under him a board upon which there are men or a lanceole; and then anoint the extremity of the cautery with oil or with albumen of egg or with mucilage of fenugreek or of similar things; and then insert that into the anus with ease, and let the minister hold the pouch and squeeze it with two hands and press with force until everything within the cristiere is evacuated; and then remove the cristiere and the patient raise his legs to the wall.
And if the medicine forces that to come out, let it be as much as possible; and if he sleeps with that for a whole night, it is better for healing.
But if you cauterize that in the diseases of a loose belly and its discharge, then repeat the cautery until it is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the cristiere be very thin and smooth, of those cristeres with which children are cauterized.
On the cure of wounds.
You have already said in the division of the cure of wounds what suited the free one, and I say thus the cure of those with hand and medicines according to the complement.
Therefore I say that wounds are varied according to what they are made of and according to the place on which they fell.
And the causes for which many times wounds are made are thus with a stone, or incision with a knife or dagger, or blow with a spear, or with a club, or with an arrow, or similar things.
But the wounds that are in the parts of the body are thus with a wound which falls on the head, or neck, or feet, or belly, or thigh, and similar things to those of the members.
And I am recommending the cure for some wounds so that you pause that reasoning and rule over the other wounds.
And I will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the recollection of the compound ones will come to the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when it happens in the head a simple wound and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is with a stone or similar, and the tendon has only just been cut and it is a large wound and you fear an abscess on the patient, then you should apply a cautery to the wound and a fleubotomy to the temporal artery immediately, and not delay that; and remove from there blood according to the quantity of its virtue if no other cause prohibits fleubotomy, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is little.
And let the fleubotomy be on the side opposite the affected part; and keep the patient from replection and wine and coarse foods.
But if some cause prohibits it, then let him be lessened of food but not approach meat or wine.
And place over the wound, if it happens to him an abscess, a hot poultice in rose oil or wine in which is mixed.
But if he is certain of an abscess, then place over the wound if it is fresh with his own blood and the air has not changed that which I recommended earlier, then place over it, then small.
And if the air has already changed that, then place over the wound albus poultices until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or it is by incision with a knife or similar, and its lips are not drawn together by threads, then draw those together with sutures according to what I recommended for them.
But if the wound is uncovered of bone and pen, and there is no retention of it except for a small suspensory, then insert that and then cure the wound with medicines and restore the flesh by cutting in the place of tendon, and command the patient to abstain from foods in which there is coarseness: garlic and formen cow and similar things to them, until it is healed.
And if you see in the tendon putrefaction and it does not adhere to bone, then insert everything rotten and cut that, and then cure that.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood might flow and it is not stopped by medicines, then tie over the artery, and if you find that uncut, then insert that with spathum, or ligature that; and if necessity compels you to do what we have said, then cauterize until the blood is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then the cause of them is coldness; for this you powder over those this powder, for when that has dried in front, the air changes it.
And the manner of the powder is this: take oil of aloes one part, dragon' blood two parts, and causticum not-extinguished three parts; let all be ground and sifted, and let the wound be filled with it, and let it be compressed with a good constriction so that it lies upon it to harden, and let the blood coagulate.
And then tighten that above with a bandage and let it be left so that it is not loose while the wound is unhealed, for otherwise it will not be healed.
And sometimes it does this on its own, when you are not in the presence of dragon's blood.
And this treatment is also performed on large wounds when it is appropriate to apply it directly and the wound is fresh with blood, which has not been altered by air.
And if the air has altered them and especially in summer, then there is no intention to use this powder, but instead cure them with what we have said, that you apply some astringent ointments or paste made from barley flour mixed with water and honey; and also cure them with the other treatment until they are healed.
But if there is a broken bone in the wound and it is small, then you must remove it with tweezers.
And I will describe the cure for fractures of the head when it has been poisoned.
Of wounds in the neck:
But if the wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment and it is the same as for a simple wound on the head.
But if the nerve of the neck is cut or an artery, then if it is a nerve, there should be no irritation but rather avoided by applying something that causes strong constriction, as well as cinchona and a kind of vitriol which is harmful to nerves and acts as a counterirritant. And you must not apply anything hot to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is sensitive and its continuation is to the brain, which is the source of all the members.
And if it is treated with mild medicines, as well as causing washing with warm water, some poultice soaked in rose oil or not, and cauterization when it is washed with warm water and the other stones are removed according to this manner, and ointments moistened.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures or cut the lips of it, and then cure it with powders until it is healed.
But if there is a deep wound or an infection in the lower part, then pierce it in the lowest place.
But if an artery is cut in the wound and blood flow is achieved, then stop or dry it, or ligature it, or cauterize it if necessity compels you to do so.
But if the windpipe or throat is completely cut through and the veins of the neck are preserved, then you must sew up the edges of the wound on the windpipe without touching it; raise it up and return it to its natural shape, and then bind it tightly with a decent bandage, and let that be for several days; and then cure it with ointments in which there is constriction and excitation until it is healed.
But if the wound has been made by pressure on bone, then pierce it and if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all that you can; and what you cannot, let that be within so that the wound becomes pustular, and let the discharge of it be separated and the swelling around it be relieved.
And if the wound is fresh, then powder it with the powder which I have recommended to you. But if a fistula is made in the wound, then cure it with that which its memory will come to you soon in this chapter.
If it is a thrust of a lance or spear and you see the depth of it, then consider that the wound is deadly if the victim shows shortness of breath; then know that the wound is lethal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is fresh with its blood, then you must apply powder to it in the first hour and not constrict it so that the blood is not retained in the depth of it and returns to the heart and that the victim is relieved, but rather apply attracting ointment to it, and loose it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not present to you, then you must place a sharp instrument in the wound's opening so that it sucks out what is in the humid parts; and let the victim sleep with their head over the wound so that what is inside it flows out.
But if three days or more have passed and there are no signs of spasms or trembling of the heart or stricture of the chest, and you see the other good dispositions of it, then know that the wound is healed; and then cure it with poultices and with the other treatment until it is completely healed.
But if its healing is delayed and all time it remains open, then know that a fistula has been made; cure it therefore according to its chapter.
And if the wound is made by a spear or lance and is simple on the surface of the foot or leg, then cure it with that which precedes sutures if it is large, or powder if it is small.
But if it has made an impression on the bone and the fragments are separated from it, then you must twist the wound and cut to extract those fragments if they are separate. But if they are not separated, then let them be within so that the wound becomes pustular and the extraction of them is relieved.
And for other wounds by accidents on other members, the treatment in cure is the same as what we have said.
Of wounds in the abdomen:
The disposition which occurs in the abdomen is either large or small or punctured.
And a small disruption is made difficult in another way and you see that their reduction is more difficult if you do not cut off the intrusion of them to their place at once, for it opens up and becomes swollen so that the insertion of it is made difficult.
And therefore the best disruption is punctured because in it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult as is difficult in the two species mentioned above.
And know that the suture of the abdomen is according to four ways, but two sutures are common in sutures of other wounds of the body.
And two other sutures are proper to other wounds but rather are more proper in the suture of the abdomen.
And I will recommend to you each one with exposition and explanation.
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and there is some cause of the intestine through it, and its reduction is made difficult, then it is in one of two ways: or because of the smallness of the disruption as we have said, or when the intestine receives cold air.
And therefore when that is so, you see that you warm it with a sponge or cloth moistened in only tepid water, or that you place it in water made warm, and cyperum, and spic, and embrocations on the intestine so that the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes it does this with the substance which has constriction, and is better than just water in resolving inflammation.
And therefore when you see the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which there is a little vinegar and mallows, for by this it is relieved the substance of it with little cause.
But if the instrument is not suitable for this cure, then split the hemorrhoids with a small instrument with which they are cut.
And the first cure is better when it is not a cut, and there is no occupation to dry by necessity and deflation.
Of the instrument, see its form:
One part of it is acute and bent, and the other part not acute, and the end fine, and not be as fine as a spatula, but rather blunt a little.
And therefore when the wound is enlarged and the intestine comes out, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form, in its proper place, if possible on it, for it is better.
But if the hemorrhoid is large and is in the lower part of the belly, then you should make the patient lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you should place his head and chest higher than his legs.
And likewise if the hemorrhoid is in one of the two parts of the belly, then pay your attention and your consideration equally to both so that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this for large hemorrhoids and for smaller hemorrhoids.
And for small hemorrhoids, use what is prepared for you, and make the minister hold it between his fingers, which have the hemorrhoid entirely in his hand and press its lips together, and uncover from that to that one side of the stitch, any cause whatever.
And this is the way of common sewing: one that you take the needle, or count of needle according to the amount of the width of the wound; and let go of the end of the hemorrhoid of the little finger, and strengthen the needle one, and do not put oil in both ends of the thread, with two ends of the ligature which is under the hemorrhoid of the fingers within, so that you make it penetrate from that party; and you have already added two ends of the thread and two ends of the ligature, and so are made four orders.
And strengthen with double oil around the needle, and several times from two parts together, and add both lips and the hemorrhoid by a decent addition; and let go of the thickness of the finger and put another needle in that one, and tie it up thus with oil as it was with the first needle; and do not cease to do this if it is necessary with needles until you have completed all the contraction of the wound.
And let the needles be between coarseness and fineness, for fine needles pierce gently into the flesh; and coarse ones are of difficult insertion in the thread, and therefore so that they be finer in fineness and coarseness.
And it is not that the needle be fixed in both ends of the thread next to each other, so that the flesh is not pierced gently and that the wound opens before its solidification.
And they are not prolonged with sewing so that the wound is prohibited from solidification.
And pierce the ends of the needles so that they do not hurt the patient when he sleeps; and you will place on the wound powdered expanders of all parts, which have the ends of the needles; and let it be until you know that the wound is solidified.
And this kind of sewing with needles in any way is more convenient for small hemorrhoids, for it has in their sewing one needle or two or around them.
But the second sewing is common: and it is that you sew the four ends, of the thread and two ends of the ligature, in one go, with a needle in which there is oil wrapped both in fineness and coarseness.
And when with the needle you have penetrated these four ends, reduce the needle from that meted part from which you began, so that the oil withdrawn box of the most sublimated part to the wound, so that the sewing is according to sewing of cloth with which the cloths are tightened.
And place between each sewing the quantity of the thickness of the little finger.
And this sewing is known to men.
And with such sewing I healed the wound which was inflicted on a man in his belly, and it was wounded by a knife, and the rupture of the wound was more than a palm, and he had come out of the intestines around two palms from the intestinal membrane, and the rupture was in the middle part of the member; and then I reduced it after the intestine had been out of the wound for 24 hours.
And the wound was solidified in the space of 15 days or around it, and I healed him and he is healthy; and thus he lived for many years, and is in his senses.
And other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and by miracle he was healed, for I did not cure him with ointment, but placed on the wound a piece of wool two times a day and an frequent ablution with water mixed with honey until he was healed.
But I will tell you two kinds of sewing according to the account of the Word.
And it is that you begin with sewing of the thread, and pierce the needle from the outside part to the inside part.
And therefore when the needle penetrates in the thread and in that you pierce the rectum and in length of all the body, and let go of the end of the ligature in which you have pierced the needle; and make it penetrate from the other end from within to without in the other end of the anus.
And when you have made that penetrate, then you make it penetrate another time in the meted end of the anus from within to without in the other end of the anus; and let go of the end of the ligature which is in this side, and make the needle penetrate in the other end of the anus.
And make it penetrate with that your penetration with which you make it penetrate in the anus in the end of the anus which is in the part of him so that all that penetrates.
And begin from this meted side and sew that with the end which is of the ligature in the other side, and pull out that needle from the thread which has penetrated, and then reduce it in that thread and tie the end of the ligature which is in the other side with this end of the anus; and pull out that needle from the thread which is of part of him.
And do that one time and another, and do that one time about another time so that you sew all that is out according to that example.
And the sum of this way of sewing is that you sew with sewing of skin with which you sew the ligature, assuming that you sew the anus one time from the end of the thread, and let it be until you have completed it.
But the second kind of sewing proper which I say is from the word of Galienus, and this is of semen of him and by him composed, is that you sew it according to similarity with which they compose medicine, assuming that you add all part to its compared part to him conveniently by nature; and apply one end of him to the other end of him, and this is done according that I have composed.
Place the needle at the tip of the eye that is closest to the side of the wound, and make it penetrate into the inside of the wound in that sun, and tie the two ends of the thread; then twist the needle and make it pass through from the outside to the inside in the two ends of the ciphr.
Then twist those knots and make some of the outside of the wound pass inside into the inside of the wound in the two ends of the eye that are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than common suture, and it is a suture of which I have given a description.
This is the speech of Walga
And some say that the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles; therefore you must put a needle into one of these, and begin with the insertion of the needle from what is below you, and make it pass into the other side according to the suture of those who sew skin to skin.
And know that when there is a disruption in the middle of the belly, then the suture of it is more difficult than that of the other places in the belly.
But the judgment of medicine for plague is the judgment of the other plagues.
And the cause is that when you encounter the plague recently with its blood before the air alters it, and return the intestine and cook it and arrange it decently, then place over it a carnative powder.
And if the air has already altered the plague, then place over it certain unction which are to you present that they make hard stone and draw out the puss, and be consolidated thread and eye; and cure that thus as is the cure of the other plagues so that it may be healed.
But if you do not have the medicines at hand, then place over it immediately, for as soon as it begins to give off a stench, change that twice a day, morning and evening, ayssi how you are taught, until it is healed, for you do not need any other medicine in various dispositions when the plagues are simple.
But if you fear that the plague will communicate injury to the principal members, then take a lion’s wool and soak it in oil of suitable quality, or in roasted oil, and place that in the circuit of the places that are between the angles and below the armpits.
And if there is pain or putrefaction in his intestines, as many times as that happens, anoint that with black styptic wine of tebe, and especially if the putrefaction is come into the intestine and makes an exit piercing into its cavity.
And know that that which is of the gross intestines is easier to heal than that which is in the subtle intestines.
And it is difficult to heal because the intestine which is called "gegunu" does not receive healing of the plague that occurs in it at all; and that is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it, and because of the magnitude of it that is in those, and because of the subtlety of the body of that, and because of its proximity to nature of nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the plague is the fabric, and you accomplish that recently, return it according to your rectitude by which you return intestines to health.
But if it has passed to him space and is already made black or dark, then that you bind that with thread over the place which is blackened by it, in order that there come flow of blood, for in the fabric there are veins and arteries.
And then insert what is under that ligament, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from below the plague hole over you, in order that upon you be alleviated the attraction of him due to the sinking of the fabric and emission of the stench of the plague.
Description of the plagues when they happen in the intestines.
When disruption happens in the intestines and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in certain men, because he had seen a man who was plagued in his belly by a spear thrust and the plague was on the right side of his stomach, and the plague was old and made a fistula, and it was driven out from him and ventositat.
Then he pursued the cure of him until it was not believed that he could be healed, but I continued to treat him gently until the fire healed and the place was consolidated.
And he had seen the place already consolidated, he guided him about the patient that in his belly was to have an accident of evil, and did not take on any accident due to the evil and remained in his usual dispositions eating and drinking, and then bathed and exercised himself.
And some experienced men say that when the plague comes in the intestines and is small, then it should be bound according to this manner: and it is that you take foments of great caps; and then adjust the two lips of the plague and place a foment of those which has the open mouth over the two lips of the plague; therefore when he takes hold of those and tightens his mouth over them, cut off the cap from him, for it will adhere and not dissolve.
And then place another foment near the first one, and do not cease that which you do with foments, one after another according to the quantity of all the plague.
And then return that and cook the plague; and let those caps remain in the intestines until the intestines are healed; and may not happen to the patient any harm.
And it is possible that the intestines be bound with thread subtle which is made of the intestines of beasts annexed to it, for it is more in a needle; and take the end of those intestinal threads, and let there be some flesh removed from it, and then bind the end of it with thread, wound up, and then insert that thread into needles and cook it with that the intestines, and return that into the disruption.
And this manner of suture with foments is not anything other than according to way of confidence and hope.
But if the plague is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the subtle intestines, for then it is nothing other than sottilization, and not its healing at all.
Of cure of suck and fistula.
Know that all plague and pustule when it is come to rot and become old, and is made ulcer, and is not consolidated and gives off stench, then in any member that it is in, universally is named fistula and we call that suck.
And fistula according to truth is swollen flesh, hard, white by which there is not pain and has cavity like the cavity of a tooth; and for that reason it is named certain rizatus, i.e., tooth.
And in some men it is moist, by which it gives off a stench; and the moisture is driven out in certain hours. And sometimes this moisture is great, and is little, and is thick, and is subtle.
I have already shown all those causes and their signs and the cure for them through medicine in the division.
And now I will tell you the cure for a fistula that is caused by surgery with the hand.
And you should know that fistulas can occur in any part of the body; some of them affect large veins or arteries, or nerves, or the brain, or intestines, or bladder, or one of the bones, or one of the spinal discs, or a joint made up of multiple parts, such as the hand and foot; and some affect areas near these major body parts.
And so, among these types of fistulas, those that follow this pattern are considered among the most challenging illnesses to cure, and they often do not receive proper treatment due to ignorance and a lack of understanding.
And if there is a fistula that does not reach these places I have mentioned, and you are hopeful for its cure, and want to understand it better, then take a needle or piece of iron and probe the fistula.
But if the fistula is winding and tortuous, then investigate it with a thin lead probe, for lead, due to its light weight, will be drawn and bent by the fistula's curves.
And if the fistula has horrible movements that you cannot understand using a probe,
then cleanse the orifices through which the enema fluid flows, for the moisture that you use to cleanse it will flow through these other orifices.
Then examine it closely, as best you can, to understand if there are any bones or nerves nearby, and whether the fistula's cavity is distant or near, or if it is a fistula whose orifices are all located on one spot, and through your examination, and the creation of pain by pressing with your hand over the area, and similar techniques and causes of pain in the swelling, you will come to understand its nature.
And once you have fully understood these causes, then move on to the cure with confidence: and consider whether the fistula is apparent nearby or in a salty location, distant from a joint, or affecting nerves, arteries, or veins, or one of the places I mentioned earlier.
Then you must dry out the fistula as already described in its description, and remove what is inside it and what comes out of its orifices, be it pus or腐肉, and cure the interior until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth and follows a winding path, then you must insert it into the fistula as far as possible, and cleanse it of all rotten flesh; then apply hot poultices wrapped in sharp medicines, and insert these into the fistula's cavity, which you have probed with iron.
And do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that is rotten inside the fistula'
Then heal it with ointments that promote healthy flesh growth within.
But if it is not healed through this method, then you must cauterize it as we have recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, then you must probe and dry it out as we have instructed, unless you detect any cause from a vein or nerve, or affecting a major body part as I have mentioned.
But if the bone is exposed and there is corruption and darkness within it, then you must remove all of this corruption; then heal the bone with what will grow new bone tissue within it.
And if it does not heal and the arm remains as it was, then you should know that you have not fully eradicated the corruption; then examine it a second time with great care, find the cause of it and cleanse it with your strongest medicine, and heal it.
And so, if it is healed, then it is good; but if not, then you should know that the corruption is in the distant depths of the body, and you have not reached it, and so you should only probe it gently.
And if the rotten bone is small, or you are able to pull it out, then do so with subtle forceps suitable for this task.
And if there are multiple bones, then carefully extract them all, and leave behind no cause for worry with your strength.
But if you encounter any resistance from the moisture, and in probing them you fear no mistake or error, then insert those limbs or flesh if they are there, and release the bones.
But if you are not prepared to pull out the bones at that time, then cover the wound with something that will cause pus to form in it, and leave behind what is around those bones of flesh and limbs, and guard the wound so that it does not heal over, and the section you have probed remains open.
Have faith, for if you are afraid, then place on it a pad soaked in soapwater, or one soaked in Egyptian ointment, or one of the green ointments, for when these liments rot, and the bones are separated from their covering, and the atraction is relieved,
But if it is a large bone like the bone of the leg or thigh, or similar, and only what is rotten is its fascia, then pull it out from behind so that the blackness and corruption is exposed, then heal the wound.
But if what is rotten is a large portion of it, and the corruption has already reached the bone's marrow, then it is necessary to close it up and probe that spot where the corruption has occurred, then heal it until it is solid.
And I urge you to ask a man to lie on his side to help support your operation.
A young man around 30 years of age experienced pain in his thigh, and the matter within it was pushed towards the head, and this matter was from the leg bone into the head, and it was an abscess with a large abscess, and there was no external cause.
And so the time extended with it due to the error of the doctors until the abscess burst, and materials came out from it, and his cure was delayed because the leg bone was fistulated, and there were many orifices in him from which pus and fluids from the body flowed.
And so he was treated by many doctors for about two years, but there was no wisdom in it except in the bone, where I was called.
And I saw his leg and the materials that flowed from him through those orifices, like a corpse; and indeed the man's body was completely swollen and his colour was yellow.
And so I inserted the probe into one of those orifices and reached the bone.
And then I probed and explored all the orifices and found that they came from all parts of the leg.
And so I cut and probed one of those orifices where I discovered a bone part, and it was rotten, and indeed it was earthy and blackened; and a part of the leg had been rotted where it had penetrated into the membrane.
And so I applied what was revealed to me and prepared for the exposed bone.
I saw that it was not in the bone but that corruption which I had cut and removed, and I had already drained it.
And then I applied the restoration of the plague with consolidative medicine for a long time, but it was not consolidated.
And then I iterated and discovered again upon the bone secondly after the first discovery, and found continued corruption in the bone.
And I removed what appeared to me to be of that corruption, and then I performed the cure and restoration of it, but it was not restored.
And then I discovered another ulcer on him and did not cease to bore into the bone little by little particularly and to perfuse the restoration of it, but it was not restored until I had bored around a palm of it, and extracted that with its marrow, and then I restored that one with medicines, and it was consolidated slightly and healed.
And it was not necessary to iterate the operation on him or to cut him except for the disposition of his disease and for the smallness of his tolerance and fear of him of death, for he suffered in all hours because of an excess of evacuation.
And so he was healed by entire healing, and nothing is in the place of hard bone; and his disposition was made good in his body, and his strength returned to him, and he was returned to his dispositions, and no contrariness was made to him in walking nor harm in any cause.
But if there is prominent bone in the place of the body that has been torn, then you should succeed with that according to this manner: and it is that you take a length of string and wind that around the extremity of that prominent bone, and command someone else to extend that for you; and place that string of wool thicker than the first string; and then wind that over the flesh that is below the bone, and extend the extremity of it so that you pull the flesh towards the parts below, and you uncover the flesh over the place which you want to cut so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
And place wood or a board below the bone decently, for when you do that it is not prohibited that the saw does not cut the corrupted flesh.
And it should be sawn on the corrupted place little by little, for if there is corruption in the concavity of the bone and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, then force must be made to cut it another time.
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, then there is one part continued with the other, and the corruption is in the middle place or in a part of it; then uncover the flesh from all parts entirely, and then pause wood below, and then saw that from the first part where there is corruption until the continuation of the cutting of the other part.
And the sawing should be according to the place of the corruption a little bit, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, then cut that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is continued from the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints then there is not reason in it except artifice.
And if the corruption is in the knuckle of the hand or the foot it is very difficult; however, you should seek out the corruption and see how it appears to you, and open that up, and cut that according to every disposition which is possible for you, and with whatever artifice it is rectified for you when no contrariness comes to you from a vein or nerve.
And know that the saws and the knives to cut these bones are much according to the situation of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their thinness and greatness and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity; so that when you prepare for every kind of operation a convenient tool for that operation.
And know that that operation tells you of the kind of tool which you lack; for with you is great study and long and knowledge of the ways of this art, and testimony of ways of diseases, for then you already had for your tools what is convenient for any instrument for every disease.
And I will show you at the end of this chapter the number of tools with which you form them with simples and which you will use to process your prohibition which you will experience over the others. Form of saw:
Form of another saw:
Form of another large saw:
Form of a file: Let the head of this file be according to the form of a key starry, and its points are according to the form of the points of a stethoscope.
And it does not concern that with that they are rubbed the heads of the joints when they are corrupted, or is the mouth large and ample.
Form of a smaller razor:
Form of a broad razor:
Form of another saw decently made: let it be made arch of it more superior and the acuteness of it of iron, and the member of it of a boy's dagger decently made. Its form is:
Form of a razor in which there is a concavity:
Form of another subtle razor:
Form of another razor with a curved extremity:
Form of a small razor resembling a tent:
Form of another smaller incisor:
Form of another incisor, this one resembling a file, and the extremity of it is like a saw, and it is shown in many places in the ratio of the bones.
Form of a file which concerns the perforation of bones:
And its extremity is triangular and of acute extremity.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, all the causes that we have said of razors and of incisers and of saws.
Of cutting edges and of the serration of bones.
The edges may be blunt or for an intrinsic cause or for an extrinsic cause, or when you have medicated that corruption with cure of those medicines and the cure does not concern, or sometimes the corruption goes away from the member which does not percept any cause, then you should cut that member where the corruption lies in order to prevent the patient from escaping through it by death or by malice which is a greater defect of the member.
And the sign of that to which it happens is that the member is made black when it was burned, or it turns black soon after the burning, then cut that member where the blackness lies in order to prevent it from turning the whole body black and causing the whole body to be affected by it.
And similarly if the cause of the corruption is a concussion from some venomous causes like that of scorpion sea or of viper or of adder or of similar kinds.
And if the corruption or concussion is in the extremity of the finger, then you cut the finger and do not give space to the corruption so that it goes into the hand.
And similarly if it comes to the hand, then you cut that from the joint of the fire-bone, and do not give space to the corruption so that it goes into the fire-bone of the arm.
And if instead you cut the arm, then cut the shoulder in the joint.
And if another corruption passes and then the collarbone, then that is the death of the patient; and add another cause to that in cure is quantity of virtue.
And likewise do to the foot as you would for corruption, then you insert it into one of the nuts.
And if it takes hold in the heel of the foot, then you insert the whole foot. But if it can enter the toe, then you insert the leg into the joint of the toe.
And if the corruption has already reached the toe, then in that case there is no remedy but to let the patient die.
And the way of cutting the member or binding it is that you stretch the ligament in the part lowest down from which you want to cut, and stretch another ligament on top of the spot; and extend one ligament to the lowest parts, and extend the other over them; and you separate the meat which is between the two ligaments so that there is a space between them wide enough to be completely exposed all the flesh; and then it is cut or bound.
And make sure that a piece of cloth is laid over all parts so that it does not touch the wound, and let the patient have a poultice applied to the wound adjusted and bandaged.
But if blood flows out when you cut into it, then cauterize the spot carefully, or place over it some powders that stop the flow of blood; and then return to your operation until it is finished.
Then bind the member that has been cut with a ligature in any convenient way, and dress the wound so that it may heal.
And he reported to you that he had an incident with a man on his foot, this patient who told you and whose problem you inquired about, which was that blackness appeared on his foot from scorching which looked like fire had scorched it.
And that corruption first happened on one of his toes, and it affected the whole foot.
And that man prepared for himself remedies that when applied to the member with his strength caused great pain and scorching heat; and he cut into that foot at the joint, and it healed.
Long ago that same kind of corruption happened on one of the fingers of his hand.
And then it came to me and forced me to reflect on that excess with what I applied to the hand, namely the purification of his body; and the excess was not reduced and began to go to the other finger as it began in the hand.
And he urged me to cut into his hand, but I did not want to do that for fear of the reaction of that excess, and yet I feared death to the hand of the patient because of the strength of his body.
And since he lost hope in me, he returned home and there found that man who had prepared and cut into his whole hand, and it healed.
And I have not added this narrative except that it be an aid about what is caught from this disease, and that it be a sign by which it is recognized and according to which it acts.
About the cure of sores and quality of cleansing with medicines.
When sores occur on certain fleshy parts and the space of the sores is prolonged so that there is a collection of pus, and then it breaks open and discharges, and the pus exits from it, and the place becomes hollow like a wound, and the membrane which is over it withers away, and no further corruption occurs in the bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinus, and is not named fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged so that corruption prevails in any part, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the cure of it is that you cut away all that membrane as it has become turned over, and especially when it has been thinned out and made with cloth, and plasters that do not adhere to the spot by its corruption.
But if you expect the membrane to adhere and that corruption has not achieved through further consequence, and in the membrane has spread out widely, then you cure it with a clyster.
And you consider the sinus and if it is large and the wound gives off a foul odor, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is of oil and sour wine and zinyar received into parts split in two, and are placed over fire so that the medicine becomes hot and attains to the consistency of honey.
And then you take of it what is necessary and dissolve it with water and honey; and clysterize the sinus with it, and plug up the opening of it, and leave the medicine in it for the quantity of two hours.
And then take out that with a spoon; and do this for as many days until the sinus is cleansed and the stink is reduced.
And sometimes it is clysterized with water of ashes when you do not have that medicine at hand; and you take the ash of wood, and place over it water; and then strain that and clysterize it with it until you are convinced that the sinus has been healed.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or water of ashes, then clysterize it with water and honey in which is mixed powdered zinyar, and clysterize it with wine and honey mixed, for the property of honey is that it cleanses and washes, and wine causes the sinus to adhere, and especially when there is excess of stiffness and dryness.
And after you do this several times and you are convinced that the sinus has been reduced, then clysterize it with what makes the flesh grow in it.
And take of the unguent called dyaphincum and dissolve it with refined oil or sharp wine, or clysterize it with some medicines and other ointments that have the properties which I have described in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow and will not receive the tube of the clyster, then you enlarge it with a small iron little by little, and place over it wool wrapped in Egyptian ointment or in basilicon ointment until it is enlarged.
Likewise if the opening is wide, then you join the lips of it with a suture and leave in it the quantity in which there is an addition of clyster.
And if the opening through which the arm goes is elevated to the parts above it, then dry that at the lower place where the pus has collected in it because when the arm is contracted in the depth of the sinus the flesh in it is engendered.
And if it is not possible to dry the sinus in the hollow of the bone according to what you want, then force it that you prepare the member with preparation by which the arm runs loosely according to how it appears to you and that there be no cause in it for the arm to be retained.
But that which is over the opening of the sinus, which is reduced in all hours as a result of what is stopped in it from the arm. And so that you may know whether what flows out of his arm is a lot or a little, or is digested, or not digested.
And in this way you may consider the location of that vein, if the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And when your medication is prolonged in this way, and you see the matter that is discharged over the orifice of the vein already adherent, or if there is proper adhesion, then on the third day, loosen the poultice, and when you loosen the wound, change the dressing for another and renew the ointment.
But if subtle humors escape from the vein over a long space of time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is proper, for there are some men in whom generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and of others the contrary occurs.
And if the arm that has been discharged is indigest for several days, then know that the vein does not adhere; and if the adhesion of the vein is delayed and its cause prolonged, then you regulate the medicines in desiccation, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they are dried as with ointment of diacon, when there is added excess of vinegar.
And the most recent one being healed is to take ointment of diacon and dissolve it in rose oil, and over it apply wine vinegar equal in its substance, and then comfort that with it, and use it.
And in that action, when there is no arm, take ointment of diacon, honey when it has been cooked until it is thickened, and use it; or take myrrh and aloe and incenses, triturate all and pulverize over the honey when it is over the fire, and then line that over a bandage and strengthen that over the vein; and line that with the honey which you have cooked until it is thickened, and pulverize over the bandage and strengthen that.
And sometimes they are administered with long-witted aristology and rays of heavenly lily (and that is the heavenly lily) and flour of erysimum and centaurea, and use those simples or adjust, triturate all and sift it and pulverize over the honey which I have recommended; and use that.
And if the vein is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in its vein, and make examination of the bones or other hard members or in the bowels; then heal it with fistula treatment, as above is said.
Of treatment of panaritis and nail abrasion and addition of digit incision and section.
Panaritis is an abscess that arises below the fingernail of the finger of the hand or of the foot, and it is usually found in the other fingers, and when it is prolonged and its healing is less valued, or it is an abscess of cautery, or it is corrupted, and it erodes the nail, and very often corrupts all of that, and the corruption very often pervades the bone within which there is a foul odor, and the extremity of the finger is made flat, and its color becomes dark.
And so when you have that in the division and do not confer your treatment, then see that you pierce with iron all of the superfluity that is rotted from the nail, and then cauterize the wound there, for hot cautery is beneficial in that.
But if the bone is intact and the nail is healthy, and the nail parts are pulling together the flesh at their ends, and they begin to pierce it and irritate it, then see that you pause a fine ray below the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push that up and insert the flesh with facility, and pause on that which rises from the flesh of the corrosive medicines until all is thoroughly cauterized; and then heal that with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption already pervades the bone, then see that you pierce the bone there and extract it, for it will not be healed as long as the corrupt bone remains.
And if the corrosion and corruption extends to the finger, then insert that in one of the nuts according to what is prescribed in its reminder, and then heal that until it is healed.
But if the nail has impact or abrasion, and there is violent pain in that, then see that at the beginning you flebotomize the patient, and then dry the nail with a sharp spatula having a transverse cut above it, and beware that the cut does not pervade into the flesh below the nail, for you will cause violent pain to the patient, and its cause is generation of superfluous flesh in that place; and then heal that place with that which relives the pain.
But a finger that is born, which occurs in the hands of some men, is usually all flesh, and very rarely bone, or it is usually nail.
And some are born in the joint of the finger, or its generation occurs in the nuts of the fingers. But that which is born in some nuts of the finger does not hurt, and that which is born in the joints is usually painful.
And of those which are born fleshy, its section is easy, and you pierce that below its root with a broad spatula.
But of that which is born in the joint of the finger, its treatment is difficult; and so beware of its incision.
But in that which is born in the finger below the nails, see that you at the beginning pierce the flesh of it with a round incision into the bone, and then saw with one of those saws appropriate to that, and then heal that until it is healed.
But consolidation which occurs to the fingers between their joints several times, or by generation of the man who was born that way, or by consolidation of the wound, or by burn of fire, or similarly, then see that you dry that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then pause between their bands of the oils of rose so that they are not consolidated easily, and separate between those, or pause between those a thin lead plate so that it is consolidated according to what you see.
And similarly if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then you dry that consolidation according to how it is prepared and suited to the figure of the member.
Of incision of varices, so are varicose veins.
Varices are varicose veins, and so are thick enveloped vessels full of serous humors which flow in the parts of the body, and their major occurrence is in the legs, and most especially in the legs of travellers and workers and carriers.
Then see that you administer the purging of the body from black cholera several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
But their treatment with iron is according to two methods: one is that it is pierced and the black blood is drawn, and the other method is that the vein is elevated and all of it is extracted.
Its section is according to this method: at the beginning moisten the leg with warm water so that the gross blood is resolved which is feculent of the leg, and then strengthen the leg of the patient at its upper part of the thigh above the knee with a bandage, and then dry the black blood in one place, or two, or three with broad incision, and then elevate the black blood with the hand of the patient at its lower part of the thigh below the knee so that the blood ascends up to the amount which you desire and which the strength of the patient tolerates.
And then tie that up, and command him to abstain from foods engendering black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are filled and this is noticed in the patient.
But the elevation of them is according to this manner: You who raise the leg of the patient, if in him are moved hairs, and then put him into a bath and embrocate the leg of him with warm water until it reddens and the veins are dilated; or that he be exercised by strong exercise, if bath is not at hand, until the limb is heated.
And then cut off the vein in the right side of the vein by section in the long or in the back of him where he feels the most pain, or in the lowest part of him where he feels it in the heel.
And then open the vein with nails and gouge the vein from all parts until it appears to sensation, and he is supposed to feel that red turns to blackness.
And then when blood flows from the vein you will see that it is white as cord.
And then you put down that which was raised and let it flow from the vein, and suspend it with an iron hook or a lead weight.
And then cut another section below that section through three fingers, and gouge the vein from above the vein until it appears.
And then raise that which was cut and insert it in the rear section where he feels it in the heel, and then extract that and raise that until it is released by the second section, and then extract that from the section which is above that.
And do this until you extract that from the section which is most superior or highest of all the sections, until all has been released; and then insert it.
And if he does not obey you in extracting and raising it, then insert a strong bent needle and pierce that and extract it, or insert under him the leg and rotate your hand all around until it is released. And beware that it is not pierced, for if it is broken, it is made difficult to raise that vein and it has come about on the patient through that damage.
And when all that has been completely released, then apply to the site of the wound wool soaked in wine and rose oil, and cure that until it is healed.
And if the vein is contracted and has tortuosity at which is enveloping at its parts, and it is not according to rectitude as we have said, then you must split that at all parts of its tortuosity and its enveloping locations, and then suspend that with nails until you raise it completely.
And beware of your section not piercing the vein and not damaging it, for it will be difficult to raise that; and serve your prudence in that.
Form of the incision with which the vein is dried:
It is not cut with nails nor is it of acute extremity so that it does not pierce the vein; and it has great flexibility, for if it were slender it would pierce the vein by its slenderness; it has superfluous thickness in him as we have said.
Of extraction of the vein of the leg:
This vein is engendered in the legs in hot lands like Al-Ategi in the land of Arabs and in hot and arid lands of India of little tenderness, and in which there is no herb nor grass.
And it is also engendered strongly in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its gestation is of putrefaction that comes from below the vein like venom within the body of serpents and worms and insects and worms engendering between the vein and the flesh.
And sign of the approach of its advent is that this vein begins in the leg with violent inflammation, and then the location is blistered, and then the vein begins to flow from the site of that blister which seems like a plant-root.
And then when you see the end of it, you must wrap around it a piece of lead whose weight is that of a penny, and leave that suspended from the arm.
And so many times as it is driven by any cause to the parts outside, wrap that with lead and suspend him. And if the vein is prolonged, then you insert a part of it and wrap what remains; and do not pierce that from which it is released until it is completely outside, for if you pierce it it is contracted and enters the flesh and makes apoplexy and inflammation in the location and ulceration.
So that it is drawn out slowly and is extracted little by little until it is completely released from the rear of him and does not hang in him any cause in the body.
And from this vein it is issued in some men who is in its length of five yards and ten, and I have seen one of twenty yards.
And if it is pierced in the hour of its medicine, then insert the leg into the wound and pierce that with a long piercing through the body until all that is in the material is evacuated, and then administer putrefaction of the location for several days by medicines; and then cure that by the cure of apoplexies.
And this vein sometimes has pains, and most often when it appears at the joint of the leg or in the leg, and comes to him pains of orifices, and it is issued from each orifice ram.
And then cure that as we have said in the division and with what is above it.
Of section over worms generated under the skin and is called bovine sickness.
This sickness is named in some land because of the cow's sickness for although it moves the cows and there are few worms which are born between the vein and the flesh, and it goes all over the body pushing and breaking through, and it is shown to sensation by its movement from member to member until it breaks the vein and comes out.
And its generation is by putrefaction of some humors like the coming of worms and serpents and roundworms and tapeworms in the belly.
And it is feared for its wickedness, for when it goes in the body and is raised to the head, and it has come to the heart, then it pierces it and breaks into it and destroys the heart, and that at the same time many times.
And therefore when you want to cure that and extract it, it is not done unless the movement of him and his appearance to sensation are done, and then you tie up what is above him and what is under him by a ligature and strong constriction, and then cut over him and extract it.
And if it is deeply rooted in the flesh and you do not pierce it, then you apply cautery by fire to the location where it resides, and the greatest cause that is feared is corruption of it by which it corrupts the location as we have said.
If you see that it has come to the head close to the throat, then tie up the neck with a strong constriction and cut over him, and extract it; and if the patient feels exhaustion of the body due to putrefying bad humors, keep him from foods engendering putrefaction.
Of section over sickness of the navel.
This sickness is named in our land navir, and it is pain which comes in some members, and then it is transferred from member to member.
I have already seen it for myself as I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village and after uncovering her arm I saw a small inflammation on the vein of the arm. And when it was pricked for an hour, I saw that inflammation go away just as quick as if it were silver being pushed from place to place, but more gently so that she did not feel pain, just as if it were living silver flowing from place to place.
And then the pain went into that spot and spread throughout the muscle and she stayed there for another hour.
Then the pain ran through the rest of her body and went down to the other arm.
And he told me that it was turning around throughout her entire body as I saw, and I was quite amazed at the transformation of her and how quickly it moved from member to member. And I had already seen something similar in my own home according to that way, but I have seen many times that pain is transferred from limb to limb. But I did not see it in the arms as in the woman.
And I did not think it was due to the arms being old with dry flesh and exposed veins, but rather because in that case the feeling of that moving wind appeared.
And it is necessary for it to not appear according to this back-cure in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with hidden veins.
And when you want to cure it and the patient is feeling that pain, then do not appear in front of him as we have said, but rather press down on him slightly and quickly over the spot where that wind was blocked and cauterize the spot.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then cure that person by expelling the wind from the body and getting rid of those wind-like things through vomit, as well as foul-smelling pills and Serapi-like pills.
By pulling out arrows.
Arrows are diverse depending on the species and the parts of the body where they land, for their diversity is that some have large points, small ones, concave ones, and blunt ones; some have three angles, some look like tongues, and some look like stars.
And the signs of the soul are when an arrow hits it and pierces the bone and is buried in the brain, for then it causes violent tremors, dizziness, vertigo, heat in the head, inflammation and redness of the tongue, spasms and confusion, vomiting of bile, a weak voice and destroyed speech; and moisture white like dust comes out of the wound.
And so if you see these signs, then refrain from curing and pulling out the arrow unless it is necessary.
But the signs of the arrow when it hits the heart are that it is near the left mammary gland and feels hard when poked, and it does not feel hollow; and the movement of the arrow is quick like the pulse, and black blood runs from the wound, and coldness comes over the extremities, and there is a cold sweat and fainting; so know that death is certain.
And the signs when the arrow has hit the lungs are foam and blood coming out of the wound, and the vessels near the neck are swollen, and the color of the sick person changes, a great spirit is exhaled, and they ask for cool air to be fanned over them.
And if the arrow hits the diaphragm which is in the chest, then the pain will be near the small ribs and there will be great pain and sighing, and all the members of the muscles are affected.
And if the arrow hits the stomach, then immediately see some indigestible food coming out of the wound.
And if the arrow hits the abdomen and is buried in it, see a wound in the flesh or the membrane or intestine which is torn, and there is no hope of curing him by pulling out the arrow.
And if the arrow hits the bladder and urine comes out, and some wound or ulcer appears on the outside, and there is great pain in the sick person, then know that it is deadly.
But the other members like the face, neck, throat, shoulders and their supports, the vertebrae of the back, the breastbone, the groin, the thigh and their equivalents of the members, are safe according to the greatest dispositions when the arrow does not hit any vein or artery and is not a venomous arrow.
And I will tell you about this so that it helps you with your curing.
The reason is that in a man who got an arrow in the tear duct of his eye into the root of his nose, I pulled it out from the other side and he was healed and did not suffer any harm to his eye.
And I pulled out another arrow from a Jew who got it in the gray of his eye, below the eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden and he did not get anything but a small extremity with which it adhered to his socket, and it was a large arrow of the pointed arrows of the Turks with lion-iron which there were no eyelids.
And the Jew was healed and did not suffer any harm to his eye.
And I pulled out another arrow from a Christian who had got it in his throat and it was an Arab arrow and it was the one with which there were eyelids; then I split it lengthwise between two needles and it was already submerged in his throat; so I made it thin and then pulled it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I pulled out another arrow from a man who had got it in his abdomen and thought he would die from it; so after he had passed 30 days and there was no change to him in any of his dispositions, I looked into the wound and probed around, and he was healed, and did not suffer any harm.
And I saw a man in whom an arrow had hit his back and the wound was closed over him, and after he had walked for seven years, the arrow came out of the root of his groin.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow had hit her abdomen and the wound was closed over her, and she did not change in any of her natural dispositions for three years, and she did not suffer any harm.
And I saw another man who got an arrow in his face and the wound was closed over him and the arrow was removed; he did not feel any pain there, and similar things happened to these men.
And I pulled the arrow out of the king's son who got it in a small place on the side of his nose and it had already declined to the right a little, and the arrow was completely hidden.
And I was called to his cure soon after the insertion of the arrow, within three days.
Then I discovered the wound of the arrow very tightly; and then I inquired about it with a subtle probe, and did not feel anything; but he felt a sting below his right ear, and then I perceived that this sting was due to the end of the arrow.
And I plastered the place with an ointment in which there is an attractive and digestive virtue, confident that the place will become apparent to me so that it dries up over it.
And I did not see in the place any significant accident that the arrow had achieved that place; and I continued with the ointment on him for several days, and no accident happened; and the wound healed in the meantime, and the patient recovered from the extraction of it within a space of several days, when one day he felt the arrow between his teeth and informed me of this.
And then I applied to the wound an acute corrosive medicine for several days until pus opened up, and by means of a probe I examined it and discovered the end of the arrow subtly, which adhered to the wood.
And then I applied in the perception of the wound that acute medicine until it appeared to me visibly the end of the arrow, and I passed time with it for the space of time within four months.
And then, since the wound was enlarged and it was possible for me to insert pincers into it, and not obstructing at all, I did not cease subtilizing and ingeniously working on that with various tools, until one day by means of tools made according to the form which will be given in the end of this chapter, I began to draw it out; and then I restored that wound.
And some doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose was not restored, and I restored it, and the wound healed up, and the patient recovered entirely in health, and nothing remained in him in any cause.
And I recommend to you the quality of extraction of some arrows so that you pause upon it rule and significance about which I have not said, for the parts of this art and the definitions of that are not comprehended by narrative nor understood by those who read the book.
And the wise artificer compares a few things about that which is moving to that which is motionless, and discovers new operation and new instrument the descent of strange causes of the art when they occur.
And therefore I say that arrows are not forced out of the limbs in which they are stuck, but according to two manners: either by attraction of the place into which they entered, or by the contrary of the other part.
And that which is forced out by the place from which it entered is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place, and is pulled out and forced out.
And if it does not obey the time at which it struck, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it becomes putrid and is separated from it, and the attraction of it and its exit are alleviated.
And similarly if it is stuck in bone and does not obey you when you strike it, then leave that for some days and repeat that with attraction and motion on each day, and it will be forced out.
And if it does not obey you after a few days, then you must pierce around the arrow in that bone on every side with a very thin boring tool until the place is enlarged by the arrow, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden in the place of the body and is hidden from sensation, then you inquire about it with a probe; and if you sense that, then draw that out with certain tools which are convenient to the attraction of it.
And if you cannot operate on it because of the constriction of the wound and because of the length of the arrow, and there is no bone or nerve or vein here, then open the wound until it is enlarged and it is possible to extract the arrow.
And if it is stuck in the ears with which it is held, then you loose the flesh in which it is stuck on every side with all the ingenuity that you can; and ingenious about that, if you cannot operate on the opening of the flesh in the fracture of the ears and in twisting them until it obeys.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow in whichever place it is, then you use with twisting of your hand with forceps on all sides so that it obeys; and subtilize with very subtle piercing that the arrow is not broken and that it is difficult to extract it and that extraction from it.
And if you cannot operate on that from your side, then leave it for a few days until the parts which are around it become putrid, and then repeat that because by then it will be separated. But if you meet with contrary bleeding, then you administer what we have said about the cure in its chapter.
And guard your virtue from incision of vein or nerve, or string, and ingenious in all manner to you possible of the extraction of the arrow; and do that with facility and tranquillity and slowness and firmness just as I and you have recommended.
And therefore that you contract the arrow so that the patient be according to the figure according to which it is due the position of the arrow in him, for it is more salutary. But if that is not possible for you, then you minister what is possible for you by the figures.
But the arrows which are forced out by the contrary of the other part, or which from him proceed some parts to the outward parts, or cause swelling the extremity of the arrow by sensation of the part above the shoulder joint and feel that eminent; then you cease about that; and let the section be according to the quantity in which the forceps take it; and then draw that out, for it is made easier to feeling.
But if it is retained in the bone, then you twist the blade according to the contrary so that the arrow presses into the bone, and enlarge it by itself, and then extract it.
And if not, leave that for a few days, and then repeat that until it becomes putrid.
And if the shaft of the arrow is in that, then you drive it out with him.
But if the shaft is lost and you wish to administer impulse, then you insert that in, if it is hollow, a tool bent so that it enters the hollow of it into the head of the arrow and then drive out that with him.
But if the arrow is hollow, then you drive it out with a strong tool entering into that, for the arrow is separated by that.
And if the arrow is poisonous, then you must cut away all the flesh around it, as much as you can, and treat the wound with whatever is appropriate.
If the arrow hits the foot or belly or bladder or side and is close enough for you to touch with your finger, then cut it out if possible. And if you can cut it out, do so and be careful not to pierce any vein or nerve. Remove the arrow and sew up the wound if necessary, and treat the wound until it heals.
Here is a description of how to make a pair of tongs for pulling out arrows:
The ends of these tongs are shaped like the beak of an eagle and serrated so that they can grip the arrow tightly without slipping.
And from these, different kinds are made: large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, the depth of the wound, the swelling, and the degree of constriction.
It should be shaped like the toe of an eagle's foot so that it can be used to loosen the arrow from within the wound and push it out with the other instrument.
Here is a description of how to perform phlebotomy on veins:
The veins from which it is customary to bleed are those from which blood should not be drawn. Those in the head are .xvi, There are also two pulsating veins near the ears, called alhasisain; two herbs on either side of the temples; and two veins in the tear ducts of the eyes, called aspicientz; and a vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein at the tip of the nose; and two gullet veins at the throat; and two veins on the lips. These are the veins that are called algelic. And there are also two veins under the tongue. The veins in the arms that should be bled are 5; Among these is a cephalica vein, which is called the wild strawberry tree in Latin; and the common name for this vein in the local language is “the head vein”; and it is a superficial vein composed of a branch of the basilica vein and another branch of the cephalica vein; and the common people call it “the vein of the whole body”, and the basilica vein is the one that passes over the armpit, called “the heart vein” in Latin, and the vulgar people call it “the belly vein”; and the funis vein is the one that passes over the elbow, and it is the one that is bled; and the salvatella is the vein between the auricular and the little finger, and it has two branches.
In the chest and the flank there are three veins: one of them is below the curve of the jaw of the wild strawberry tree; and the second is the sophena, and its location is below the flank of the domestic side; and the sciatic vein, whose location is below the curve of the jaw of the wild strawberry tree; and in the flank are other veins similar to these.
Bleeding from the veins near the ears is good for old catarrhs, migraines, and old ulcers in the head.
And the way to bleed these veins depends on what you observe: if you see redness on the patient's head, wash the patient's head with warm water and massage it with your hands; then tighten the patient's neck with a bandage so that the two veins near the ears appear in two depressed places on the head; and feel those with your finger, and if you feel a pulse in them, pierce them with a needle.
Then take the cutting knife and pierce it where it is insertion into the vein so that the blood comes out through the hole. And then lift your hand up with the vein and the artery towards the parts above, and pierce the vein with an insertion cut. And let the length of the incision be about two finger widths, or around that; and let as much blood come out as you want.
Then tighten it with a bandage so that it heals.
And now I have described in the beginning of this book the incision and cauterization of these veins.
But the bleeding of the two arterial veins in the temples is good for old migraines, bad blood, and constant eye pain and sharp pains in the face.
And the way to bleed these veins depends on what you observe: tighten the patient's neck so that the two veins appear, and if you feel a pulse under your finger, pierce them with a needle.
And then lift the artery above the vein towards the parts above with your finger, and pierce it so that it comes out below, and lift the vein up, and do as you did with the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then loosen the tightened neck of the patient, and place your finger over the vein for an hour, then place a poultice and a bandage over it and tighten it so that it heals.
And now I have described their memory, and the incision and attraction of these veins in the beginning of this book.
And so the benefit of bleeding the forehead vein is also the bleeding of the cephalica vein for old diseases of the face, and migraines and feverishness and pus-filled ulcers.
And the way to bleed this vein depends on what you observe: tighten the patient's neck with a bandage so that the vein appears, and then take the instrument called “掘削器” (fossori), of which this is the form:
Place the prominent point of the fossori, which is at the tip of the instrument, over the vein and pierce it with a needle or another tool in the manner described, and let the blood flow according to your need; then loosen the neck of the patient and tighten it so that it heals.
Sometimes it is opened with a wide incision, but do not let the incision be too sharp like the other incisions, but rather oblique, for the bone is close by and would break if the incision were too sharp.
But the benefit of bleeding the two veins in the tear ducts of the eyes is for pain in the eyes and feverishness and inflammation in them, and for diseases of the face.
And the way to bleed them is for the patient to be sitting up, and then bleed them, and you should be standing over the patient's head.
And let the incision be made according to the transverse, about a finger's width in length, for there is no flesh in that place; and if the incision is too sharp, the end of it will break.
Then let the blood flow as much as you need, and place a poultice over them, and tighten them so that they heal.
But the bleeding of the nose vein is beneficial for acute fever and violent inflammation, and for diseases of the face and migraines and feverishness that occur in the face, especially when it is old.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is that the patient tightens his neck and with your left hand, you take the phlebotomy needle and insert it into the middle part of the nose according to its straightness because the vein does not appear in feeling here and because the blood starts flowing immediately.
And when you finish, hold the needle with your hand little by little and let the blood flow according to your need; and tie it at night because this is restored quickly.
But the benefit of phlebotomy in both ears leads to the constriction of bile and the beginning of leprosy and many illnesses and bad corrosive ulcers as well as herpes.
And the quality of phlebotomy for these is that the patient tightens his neck down a little with complaint and the artist stands over the head of the patient who is sitting on a stool.
And then phlebotomize the vein from top to bottom with a small, wide needle little by little and extract blood according to the amount of temperature or according to what you see is needed and do the same with the other vein.
And then untie the ligature and tie the two veins with a loose ligature so that the patient is not too tired and let him rest until the wound is healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy in the veins of the ears, treats small abscesses and pustules in the mouth and corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures and bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the quality of phlebotomy for these is that you make the patient lower his head and tighten his neck with a bandage and then pull down his lips and look at two veins, one of which is on the right side of the lip and the other on the left; and their demonstration is due to the darkness of each of both, and this more so because in the circuit of these there are small black veins; and then cut into each with a cutting incision.
But if you doubt this and do not know which is which, then cut into the largest of these, or where there is the most pus evident.
And do the same with the two veins that are on the lips above.
But of the two veins that are below the tongue, the benefit is phlebotomy in the cephalic towards pre-occlusions that are in the throat, to the illness of the uvula and to illnesses of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing these is that you follow the patient between your fingers in front of the sun and lift up his tongue and look below it, from one side of him there is a vein and from the other side there is a vein, and the color of each is declining to blackness.
And then phlebotomize them both; and be careful not to cut into your hand while phlebotomizing these because below these are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the head are found in all people, and phlebotomy of them is done according to two ways, either by putting on the phlebotomy needle with myrtle or olive oil declining in subtlety; or cut it with a scalpel and call it if it is a vein, and this is its form:
Be the sides of it as often as needed, and convenes to open up the concave veins that are full and apparently large, and to those which contain thick, twisted blood.
And this phlebotomy is of less breadth and more subtle end, and convenes to phlebotomizing subtle veins that contain citrine blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy in the basilic vein which is one of three veins, because when blood is extracted from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, and what affects the feet and belly.
And it convenes to the phlebotomizer, when phlebotomizing that one, to guard well and be over-cautious in that one because below it there is an artery, and if he errs and cuts into the puncture of the phlebotomy, cut that artery and stop the flow of blood, therefore, it is not proper to phlebotomize that one with a piercing needle but rather cut it with a scalpel.
And if the basilic does not appear by manifest appearance, then it is proper that you leave it and change to the other or look for some ram of it; or phlebotomize in the end of the arm because this is manifest; and cut it with a scalpel as we have said.
But if you want to phlebotomize it metiously, then it is proper in front of the tightness of the arm that you touch the location between where you know the location of the pulse, and then press on it with your thumb; and let him rest his arm and cut the vein with a concave incision with a scalpel as we have said; and be careful not to hit the artery with a needle at all.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, swelling in the location that you pressed with your thumb, then this swelling is of the artery, and therefore cut it off.
And if you see the blood flowing in the phlebotomy as a color of infant's milk and the blood is thin red, then know that it is of the artery; and then press your finger over it for a long space; and then release your finger and if the blood is stopped because many veins are stopped, then tighten the arm and leave him.
And be cautious of the patient for a few days and be over-cautious of him and not anger him.
But if the blood is not stopped and you see that medicine is not present at all, then cut the artery, if it appears to you; because the end of it is contracted and the blood is stopped or take a small piece of fig tree, cut it, and take the one side and tighten it over the location of the vein with a ligature and a bandage around it on the next day.
And then if the blood is stopped, it is good; and if not, then treat that one with what it preceded from the memory of the location of the veins from which the flow of blood is stopped.
And the cutting off of blood from it is difficult in many dispositions because of the small location of the plague and the possibility of the tightness of the arm.
But of the dark vein the phlebotomy is benefit that extracts blood from the superior part of the head and the inferior part of the body because it is composed of a ram of the basilic and a ram of the cephalic as we have said.
And it is proper to be cautious in phlebotomizing that one because below it there is a nerve; and then if it cuts into the puncture of the phlebotomy and hurts the nerve, stupor will come upon him and healing of him is difficult, and very rarely is he healed, and this nerve many times appears in feeling; and if it is hidden in some people and is thin and not manifest, then it is proper that you stop the phlebotomy with which you phlebotomize with a concave incision and avoid the nerve with your strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you cut the vein in its length.
The benefit of the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it drains the blood from the head and brings relief to the illnesses of the brain.
And for this specifically, if you want to perform phlebotomy using an olive-wood needle or a myrtle-wood one; for it is the safest of all veins, as it does not pierce any artery or nerve.
However, very often in some people, a hickey does not appear after phlebotomy on the first percussion; do not press on that hickey.
The first of these is that one should know that phlebotomy is not administered except for the preservation of health and for hope in it, and as a precaution against the onset of illnesses; and that phlebotomy be performed at the beginning of spring, after breakfast in the spring and autumn, and in winter close to mealtime, when signs of fullness appear.
And phlebotomy be performed on the third day or the first after three hours have passed in the morning.
However, phlebotomy which is administered, if it produces convenience and necessity for that, or at night or during the day, at any time and at all times.
And it must be that children are not phlebotomized until they reach 14 years of age; and pregnant women should not be phlebotomized until the fourth month until the seventh, and the elderly who have surpassed 60 years of age are not phlebotomized.
And when someone wants to be phlebotomized for any reason, it must first cleanse the bowels before phlebotomy with a lion's rectal suppository if in them there is retained broken wind, so that the veins do not push out the superfluities upon phlebotomy of the bowels, which are purified, and that they do not harm the principal members.
And those who are phlebotomized should not be nauseous or vomit, nor have an illness or drunkenness within them from which it has not yet been purged; and not sick of hydropsy, but that phlebotomy be feared when colic pain occurs, or vomiting, or a pain in the belly, or multiplication of cough, and labored breathing, and due to all causes that dissolve strength, whether bodily or animal.
And consider subtly on the withdrawal of humors before that if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if it is possible to do so.
And enter into a bath if some cause does not prohibit it, or be exercised by some exercise so that the blood is subtilized.
And perform phlebotomy on him in the evening of the day, as it is around the hour of terce, just as we have said.
And make sure that the foot of that one is guarded on that day from all accidents of animals, as it is constriction, anger, fear, and of all bodily accidents, as it is labored breathing and excessive pain, cough and their likes.
And for his own sake, make the causes present in the use of which men are accustomed to aromatics and odorous substances, and balsamic things and their likes according to the quantity of possibility.
And follow the phlebotomizer on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of him who is to be phlebotomized.
And stretch out your arm, and wipe that with his hand the phlebotomizer twice or thrice; and tighten the bandage with a belt and wrap that twice.
And let the tightness be moderate, for when there is not equality in the tightness, or the tightness is on superfluity, then flows of blood are prohibited; or it is on a softening, and then the blood of the body runs out.
And with the tightness, make sure that he who is to be phlebotomized rubs his hands together in between them so that the veins are inflated and made apparent to the sense.
And let the phlebotomizer smear his needle with a little old oil properly; and let him pause his right index finger on that vein, from which he wants to phlebotomy so that the vein escapes a little, and the percussion is stopped because it is of those veins which are compressed as by a string when they are phlebotomized, and of those which are full of windiness; and when he pauses the needle upon that it is constricted, let him remove the needle, and the needle does not open the vein, and if it does, that one is constricted.
And so, for this let the phlebotomizer be stopped and solicited in all of these causes.
And let the needle be paused, but if the vein is opened in a while, then it is; and if not, repeat that again another time beneath that location a little, or upon it with compression if the location is not hickeyed.
And if the location is hickeyed or the sick person shudders, then leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage, for it will quickly attract hickey cautery, nor enter into a bath.
And let the phlebotomy be iterated if there is love.
And if the wound is small and the blood flows subtley, and you fear that the amount of blood which you want does not flow, then repeat the needle in that vein according to rectitude and adjust it a little in the perception, for the location is hickeyed in many people due to few perceptions.
But if he has hickeyed before then do not repeat on him for it does not help you any cause; and pause over that some part of the wound with oil, for it stimulates the blood of the body. And it is better in this location than other oils.
And similarly administer oil in all phlebotomies for which phlebotomies the veins must have the prohibition of blood of the body, and make it teryak and sagzenea when it is paused over that one of those on the location, for the blood is subtilized and is moved when it is thick.
And if in the location of phlebotomy a great hickey is generated from many times occurring, and especially to him for which there is not stood bloody save that vein once, or in the perception of the vein little, then you cot it, and pause over the location sponge soaked in water and salt, a little warmed, and tighten that for an hour, for it is dissolved.
And make sure that that one also let the flow of blood from that vein with its compliment or another vein.
And if it appears in the location for some days some blackness or viridity, do not notice that; and if you want, pause over that some cause of aloe and myrrh dissolved, or some cause of succus of mastic tree or of powder or its like.
And many times hickeying and eminences are generated by phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And therefore pause your hand over that, and if you then push softness by your compression over that, then that eminence is wicked and bad; and therefore guard yourself so that pause over that any cause of what we have said, for it will quickly flow from the artery blood.
And make a poultice with water in which is added styptic, so that the wound is hardened and then heal it with another treatment until it is cured.
And whatever you draw out of the blood, do so according to the amount of its virtue and according to the color that appears over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it be cooked until it turns red; and likewise if you see that it is thick, let it be cooked until it becomes subtle; and likewise if it is sharp, let its sharpness be tempered.
And for the person who is full and strong and needs bloodletting in a single session, the phlebotomy of the vein should be widened and the phlebotomies should be wide.
And for those who are feeble, do the opposite; and whoever draws it out in several sessions, let the incision be narrow.
The best way to administer phlebotomy of the vein is by a cross-section, not a puncture.
This method of phlebotomy spares blood flow and nerve incision, and it is more manageable and safer than phlebotomy according to width and length.
And whoever is accustomed to experiencing syncope due to phlebotomy, cure them before the phlebotomy with a small piece of bread soaked in wine of pomegranates or plain oxymel heated; and draw out their blood in three or four sessions.
And if there is an inflammation of the face, then take before phlebotomy bread soaked in myrrh syrup or in scented honey syrup with spices like pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar; or scented syrup and very fragrant.
And if syncope occurs due to phlebotomy and the cause is excessive blood loss, then have them drink a little wine and scented syrup; and use aromatics with aloes, and bind their feet with it.
And use the other causes that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on syncope due to evacuation.
And whoever wants to open their arm and dissolve their blood second time, from whom the phlebotomy is for great evacuation, and whose nature is cold, should evacuate the blood little by little according to the amount of its virtue in consecutive days.
But whoever wants to open their arm and draw out their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then do so about seven or nine hours from the first phlebotomy.
But whoever wants to throw out their blood from their body against the direction in which it declines, let them be bled on the second or third day.
But a body in which blood is already heated and sharpens and fever ensues, let them be bled once, and let a large quantity be taken from him, and the wound be enlarged so that syncope occurs; and keep all the conditions of phlebotomy, and place your hand over his pulse against the direction of the flow of blood, so that it does not flow towards death instead of syncope, for many times this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And do not press hard on the arm and make the blood flow out with difficulty when you want to open the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, after the orifice of the vein is closed and it has become difficult to draw out the blood; rather, gently extend it slightly bent, for this is very harmful.
Have the wound healed before it is bled again; or clean it with a sharp instrument if coagulated blood remains in the orifice of the vein; or place tallow or alum on it, and compress it gently with a slight poultice until the blood flows out.
And if the vein is inflamed, then let it be left alone and not touched until the inflammation subsides.
And if you are compelled to evacuate the blood again and there is no excuse, then bleed them in that place or on the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "the strings of the arm" is bled in the place of the basilic or the cephalic vein when they are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of these.
And the quality of phlebotomy is that the patient immerses their hand in hot water so that the vein becomes prominent and appears evidently.
Then it should be bound tightly with a bandage using a small needle; and phlebotomy should be done according to the small transverse, not longitudinally nor according to length.
And let the wound be wide and your phlebotomy of it on the joint of the hand be small.
And if the flow of blood is prohibited, then immerse the hand in hot water again and let the blood run into the water until you have satisfied your need.
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from immersing your hand in hot water; and the body of the blood is bathed in hot water during the winter months.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, for there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.
And phlebotomy of the outer part of the right hand is related to diseases of the heart.
And the quality of phlebotomy is that you bind the hand with a bandage or your own hand, after having immersed it in hot water, until the vein is swollen and this is demonstrated by the pulsation; then bleed it transversely; and if you insert the needle everywhere, it will not harm anything.
And beware of not penetrating your hand with the phlebotomy, for beneath are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
Then immerse the hand in hot water and let the blood flow into it, for if you do not immerse it in hot water, the blood will coagulate in the orifice of the vein and flow is prohibited.
And when the blood is drawn according to the amount of need, then place olive oil and salt over the vein so that it is not dried up harshly; likewise let them apply it in every limb.
But phlebotomy of this vein of the left hand is related to diseases of the uterus.
And do likewise in phlebotomy like you have done in the other.
And phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is related to diseases which are below the body, like diseases of the womb, and retention of menstruation, and also to diseases of the knees and old ulcers of the feet and hands, and their likes.
And the quality of phlebotomy is that the patient immerses their foot in hot water and rubs it so that the veins appear; and tie with a bandage around the ankle; and the location of the vein appears at the tip of the toe, and from there it branches into the fascia of the foot in many branches.
Then phlebotomy is performed on the broadest branch below the ankle, for it is better and safer.
And if you bleed it in the fascia of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are below it on the fascia of the foot; and phlebotomy is performed according to the way you want to insert it, as if you were to pierce it.
And let the phlebotomies be mild.
If there is a prohibition on the movement of blood, then you should raise the patient's leg in warm water and allow the blood to flow into that area which needs to be evacuated.
And if the bloodletting instrument fails on the first attempt, then repeat the bloodletting a few times, because the site is salty; and do not fear evil on him, but rather beware of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly, do this to the other foot in the same way.
And from the sciatic vein, the site is as we have said, under the talus bone below the ankle of the wild forest.
And the benefit of the bloodletting for him is at the hip joint when it is due to stagnant blood.
And the quality of the bloodletting for him is that the patient should enter a bath, and quickly and tightly tie the bandage on his thigh on the side of the wide space above the talus above four inches in one long slender bandage, because it does not appear except through that.
And so when it appears, then you should bloodlet that according to your ability and according to the cross-section, and it is better; or pierce that with a piercing instrument or cut that with a cutting tool, because the site of it is salty.
And it is in most men hidden; and if you find that, and it does not appear to the touch of all, then bloodlet one of its branches, and it is that which appears on the back of the foot opposite the little finger and ring finger.
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow in the quantity you want.
Then untie the constriction and place something on the site of the bloodletting, and tightly bind the area, because usually it heals quickly.
Of ventilation and the qualities of using those.
Ventozes are from horns, or ram's horn, or glass.
And ventilation is done according to two methods: one of them is with scarification and extraction of blood, and the other is ventilation without scarification.
And this ventilation that is without scarification is according to two methods, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And the vents that are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are twelve sites on the body, one of which is where a paunch is placed in the back of the head; and the middle part of the two parts of the neck together; and vents from the chin below the jawbone and below the mouth; and vents from two spatulas; and vents from alohoster, which is above the end of the tailbone; and vents from two little holes, which are in the armpits; and vents from two little bones; and vents from two thighs.
And ventilation does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it has the virtue through them as is evident through phlebotomy; nor do I think that ventilation should be done with fire or without fire in any disease caused by a full body evacuation.
But if need demands ventilation for disease or for continence, we should administer it throughout the month and in its middle and also whenever necessary.
And therefore when you see any of those causes, and especially if it is in the third or middle of the month, then we command ventilation to be done after two or three hours have passed of the day.
And the benefit of ventilation at the nape is that when it confers heaviness to the head and to that which is sunken in the eyes; but we beware that this is not a full body evacuation.
And this ventilation is at the site of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
It is not advisable to use it on anyone who has a complex fever or in whom there is catarrh, because it causes great harm to him.
And therefore we beware of using it on the elderly and on heads in which there are cold diseases.
But if after that is continued over him there is forgetfulness; and therefore we command the ventilator to pause his hand for a moment with the ventouse at the sites below, fearing the occurrence of forgetfulness.
But ventilation of alkehel is at the site of phlebotomy of the dark vein and of the basilica: and therefore it confers asthma, and to constriction of throat and to splitting of throat, and to cough, and to congestion.
And let the alkehel ventilation be stopped for a moment, because if it is stopped below, it generates weakness in the body and stomach.
And ventilation of alhagdahan confers accidental pains in the head and to ophthalmia, and hemorrhoids, and pre-vision, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is at the site of phlebotomy of the basilica.
And let us command the ventilator not to press his hand while scarifying, lest he pierce an artery and cause an outbreak of blood.
And ventilation below the chin confers colic in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and appearance to them of diseases that are in the mouth, and it stands at the site of phlebotomy of alicric, which is on the two lips.
But ventilation that is done over the two spatulas confers headaches, which are caused by congestion of heat.
And ventilation of the two sites in the pits of the armpits confers benefit from phlebotomy of three veins, namely the basilica, the cephalic and the dark; because it draws blood from all those small veins in the flesh, and those small veins from the other large veins through which there comes attraction to the three veins.
And let us command the ventilator not to go too deep in scarification, because the site is deprived of flesh, and below it are nerves and arteries.
And it is a ventilation in which it is ventilated over the buttocks and confers benefit to the hemorrhoids of the anus and to ulcers below them.
And let us command the ventilator that it be a strong ventilation, and that it is of ram's horn, because the site needs a strong section; and they pierce very small vents with a pointed cautery instrument and it is scarified with scarification.
But vents of the legs are lessened for manifest diminishment, because they draw blood from all the body, and confers benefit to ancient pains of the knees and of the uterus, and induce menstruation, and confer benefit to hernia and hemorrhoids; and they stand at the site of phlebotomy of two sophens, and in the armpit, and of two little bones.
However, they weaken all the body and cause syncope in many people.
And the benefit of vents at the armpit is that it is close to the benefits of vents at the two legs.
And the quality of the position of the leeches is that you place the leech at the beginning of the vein and suck gently, and do not prolong the position of the leeches, but remove them lightly, and keep the patient still so that the humors come to the affected area naturally. And do not stop repeating this until you see the area turn red and swell, and a heat from the blood appear.
And then you should scarify and continue to suck gently, gradually, while observing the condition of the body.
Indeed, for a person with tender skin and few scars, you should scarify once and not again so that the area does not become ulcerated.
And instruct the leech to deepen the scarification and take a little more blood, tempering the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then you should scarify twice: by opening up the pathway to the blood and moisture in the first scarification, you ensure that these are drawn out. But in the second, you seek to extract the thick blood itself.
And if the blood is very foul, then a third scarification should be made so that all impurities are expelled.
Finally, when we want to extract a little blood or a small amount, one scarification is sufficient.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we should make many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then we should scarify deeply with a wide scarification.
And the term "scarification" refers to both the depth of the cut and the width.
And if the person has a thick, tough hide with tight pores, then the areas where leeches are to be placed should be made smooth and open; in summer, this can be done using oil of aloes, oil of violets, oil of bitter almonds, or oil of camphor gum; and in winter, oil of nardus, oil of lily, oil of camomile, or blood, and similar substances.
And if the superficial layer is thick and tough, then the oils should be of myrrh, or oil of balsamita, oil of aloes, oil of aniseed, and similar substances.
But if the leech has wide pores and a tender skin, then oil should be prohibited; instead, the areas where the leeches are to be placed should be washed with hot water or hot salt water, or with water of vinegar, or with water of soap, or with similar substances.
And if the person has blood that is very moist, then wash the leech-bites with sour wine, or with water of myrtle and sumach, or similar substances.
And for those whose superficial layers are thick, wash the leech-bites with old wine, or with water of sage, which is marjoram, or with a decoction of aniseed, or of camomile, and similar substances.
And the leech-bite should be kept dry; some say that it should be exposed to the sun for an hour or two, and then the patient should sleep with the leech in place.
What is the purpose of this, that one should be bled before being leeched?
Consider the beginning: if the leech or the person to be bled is choleric and has hot blood and inflammation, then they should take cooling remedies, such as acetic milk-vetch, and endive in sour wine and lettuce, and henna, and julep, and similar substances.
And give them foods such as poultry, and flesh of wild birds, and seasoned foods with vinegar, and to him similarly.
And for the person who has a hot complexion, let them drink honeyed water, or honeyed water of sesame seeds and sumach, and very fragrant wine between spring and winter; and let him be commanded to eat sparingly, and give him foods of poultry and cabbage and pigeons and small birds and doves.
And on the day of leeching and bleeding, let his drink be greater than his food.
And let him be given in drinking at certain times to some people terebinthine of aloes, or medicine of musk, so that it is musky, or alcelita before the leeching or bleeding or afterwards, so that the principal members are comforted and the blood is drawn out; and let not them take those scabs.
But the leech-bites that are to be scarified should be those that are placed over the liver, and over the melsa and podagra, and over the umbilical region, in the places of the joints, and the tip of the elbow, because these members do not endure scarification upon themselves.
And it is not desired for those but attraction of blood from the member, so that they place the leech over the breast in malacia of flow of blood of the blood of the veins; and they use it so that the thick leech is dissolved and softened within the member, so that they place it over the belly and the umbilical region; because it softens the member and opens it and reduces its pain as it resolves the leech.
And indeed it is placed over the bones when they become swollen in their joint or broken, for by virtue of strong attraction it opens their joint and removes the break from its place.
And similarly, when it is placed over the liver and the melsa for those who are confined.
And these leeches should be applied with suction only; and some are applied with fire.
And some are applied full of water in the afflictions of the melsa.
And that is why the leech should be filled and made large, so it is water alone or water in which there are mixed herbs according to what is convenient.
Form of leech applied with fire: its orifice should be the size of two grains, according to how we have formed it; and the amount of heat should be the size of a palm; and in width on him, in the place where it is in the circuit, its size should be that of him, and the burn should be small according to the amount that enters into him like an awl.
It is made of ramie, or citronwood, of thick margins, hemp, and thistle, in order that it does not irritate the member, it should be placed over him in its position upon him.
And a bar of iron or steel, where the candle is held with fire, is applied across his back.
And indeed this leech should be larger than that which we have recommended; and the few smaller according to the afflictions and the condition of him who uses it.
And leeches for children and exhausted people should be smaller than those for adults and large-bodied people.
And the quality of applying this leech with fire upon the member is that it lengthens the joint with a decent fire before a few candles of wax, and let it be placed over the middle of the bar across the middle place of the leech, so that the fire is lit around the bottom so that the body of the patient is not burned.
And then let it be placed over the member of the patient, and his finger over the break that we have said, while holding the leech so that when we hold it and the steam rises upon that break, then the leech will be dissolved immediately.
And light the candle according to its use, and relight it if it goes out.
As for the cupping glass which is administered in the disease of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse vein or pulse, and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and it is placed on the limb merely.
And this is its form: And this cupping glass, as large as it is, is better, so that it can receive a great quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not applied to the small parts of the body where it is not possible to place cupping glasses because of their size, such as the hand and the gums and similar areas; or on bare flesh, like the finger and the nose and similar areas.
And you should use leeches that you have found in the warm waters of the sea, clean from dirt.
And they should be kept for one day and night in warm water, until they are hungry, so that no cause remains in their bellies; and the body should be evacuated at the beginning with phlebotomy and cupping glasses; and the limbs of the patient should be rubbed until they turn red; and then they should be applied to him.
And when they are full, that is enough.
And if it is possible to suck the spot with a cupping glass, it is better to do so.
And if not, then wash the spot with sweet wine and then with pure water; and it should be rubbed and pressed.
And if the flow of blood continues after the removal of the leeches, and it is sweating, then you should dip a cloth in cold water and place it over the spot until the sweating is absorbed.
And if the blood is increased, then sprinkle powdered vitriol, or onions and similar things from the causes of astringents, until the blood is stopped; or the pods of cooked fava beans should be applied to the spot and left until they adhere to it, and the blood is stopped.
And if it is necessary to repeat the leeches, as often as possible.
And if the leeches are prohibited from being suspended, then the spot should be rubbed with fresh blood or a needle should be stuck into the spots where blood can be seen; and then they should be applied, for as soon as any blood is seen.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle some ground aloes or salt or ashes over them, and they will soon drop off.
Thus begins the section of the third part: on restoration. This chapter is very necessary many times in the art of medicine; it is a restoration of fractures and accidental displacement in the bones.
Oh son, understand that the foolish doctors and the common people and those who have not read the books of the Ancients nor have understood a letter from them boast about this chapter.
And for this cause the manner of those learned in our land is private; and I have not been obliged to it at any time because of all; and I have not applied what I have learned, except through long reading of the books of the Ancients and study on the understanding of those, until I extracted their science.
And I also add to it experience and study throughout the length of my life.
And I have already described in this chapter everything that my science tells me and about which my experience has passed; because I have shortened it for you others and freed you from occupation of elongation; and I have shortened it in the end of shortening, and shown it at the end of demonstration, and formed many forms of instruments that are administered in it, as is done through addition of demonstration, as I have done in two preceding chapters.
First Chapter.
Summary and collections from being fractures of bones, from which whose precedent is necessary before we begin the remembrance of fractured members and various if any. And so that we may begin at the beginning of this chapter the summaries of speech, and the chapters to understanding of which in the beginning the artificers and in station on the truth of those are compelled; you and those who are prompt to know this noble art others from you.
And so I say that when accidents happen to any fracture or displacement or twisting or hernia, then you should begin at the beginning with phlebotomy or leeching him, or whatever poultice, unless some cause prohibits it, as is debility of strength, or he to whom it happens is an infant, or old in decrepitude, or there is violent heat, or violent rubbing.
And let him be content with food of herbs fresh and of meats of birds and of crabs; and forbid thick meats and full of food that fills the veins with blood, until you are sure of suppuration of cauterisation, and if you do not fear effusion of matter into the member.
And then return the patient to his first regime with which he used to cure himself.
And so when the bone is broken begins to be restored, then let the patient be fed with nourishing foods of food thick and heavy in which there is stickiness, as are foods made of wheat cooked in water, and rice, and caps, and peas, and bellies of cows, and hives, and fresh fish, and wine thick and similar things to those, and at this regime coagulation of fracture is made sooner and better.
And know that the broken bones when they are in old people or in those who are weak, it is not possible for them to be continued and consolidated according to their nature by the drying of their members.
But nature adjusts and binds on the broken bone of all parts any cause like glue in which there is thickness that adheres and strengthens together, until they come to an end of strength and firmess, as fire at the beginning, so that no cause prohibits it from its works.
And for this cause it is necessary that you stop the foods of the patient, foods in which there is heaviness and stickiness and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the kinds of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of members, for the fracture of the bone of the leg is different from the fracture of the bone of the head; and the fracture of the bone of the foot is diverse from the fracture of the bone of the toe; and similarly all other members are diverse among them.
And I have come by remembrance of every species of fracture, explained in its distinct chapter from the others.
Great diversity of fracture in itself. And the kinds of fractures are diverse in their joints; for there is made arcuated fracture another that occurs in them stars; and some times fracture according to the length of the bone: and so fractures of the satagia and asthlas and additional joints and non-additional joints, as is made in the pen when it is prepared to write, and fracture is fissure small.
And every species has its own pain or torment in its restoration according to what will come by remembrance of it distinct in its places.
A sign of bone fracture. And by this it is known that there is a fracture: if the bone feels crooked and has a protuberance which can be felt and seen, and when you press on the bone, it hurts.
And if in the spot there is no crookedness visible nor any protuberance and the patient feels no great pain when you touch it and move the bone, then here there is no fracture.
It is possible that there might be a crookedness or a small crack, then you need not worry about this if you touch it with your hand and compress it; you should put on the medicine of which you have experience at this moment when it suits the spot; and it should also be tight with a subtle bandage.
And know that when the spot is arched and not split in two or anything else which does not happen there, like when it is completely healed all over its surface, then you should start to treat it by cauterization until it is cured.
And if an ulcer occurs there, then leave it for several days until the ulcer stops; and then heal it in any way you can using medicine or by other means.
And know that the restoration and piercing of this spot is more painful than the bone in which the fracture occurred.
And then strengthen it according to what you remember about it.
But if the bone is healed, then extension of this broken member into two parts is necessary, whether it is the arm or leg; or with your hand if the member is small; or with two cords or with one cord and the hand.
And then you should place the member in its natural position as much as possible while the broken parts are extended, and you should pierce these joints with a pointed instrument or by any other means that you can think of for their location.
And beware that you do not cause pain to the patient or harm through your operation; and see to it according to your ability that you apply one bone to its fellow according to their best forms.
And you should then advantageously touch it with your hand and if you see anything else there, rectify it and heal it by the amount of your skill.
And avoid violent extension and compression, as many foolish doctors make ulcers occur through their operation or cause contraction in the member just as we have seen it through the operations of many times.
And the quality of the broken member's tightness is such that you count it; for you should know that the broken members are different in their smallness and in their greatness and in the forms of those.
And those which are small like the arm and the finger and the wrist and their likes, then you should have a very thin cloth wrap it up.
But those which are large like the thigh or leg, then in those you should have a hard wrap, because the tight wrapping connects the large member and tightens it all around with an even binding so that no crack occurs within it.
And then you should begin by adjusting and tying it, pausing with a convenient bandage over the spot of that fracture with three or four wrappings depending on what the member deserves; and tighten your hand a little with the binding.
And then you should go to that at the top of the spot of the fracture and tighten it so that your tightening does not focus on the spot of the fracture. And then you should lengthen it by wrapping the spot of the fracture a little and loosen the tightness little by little while taking a large grip on that spot.
And then you should take another bandage and wrap that other part over the broken spot, and then you should go to the wrappings at the bottom of the fracture; and your operation should be in loosening the wrapping and in softening it according to what we said above about the first wrapping.
And then you should pause between the wrappings of cotton or cloth by which the crookedness of the fracture is evened out, if there is crookedness in it; but if not, then don't pause for any reason.
And then you should pause on it another bandage and then heal it on these decently made layers, if there is no inflammation or ulcer in that spot, and then you should pause over it whatever causes the ulcer and which stops the inflammation; and let that be for several days; and then you should tighten the layers.
And the layers should be made of thin split cane, or of wood; or of strips of palm tree; and the thickness of each layer should be according to this form and this figure:
However, the layer that is paused over that fracture should be thicker and tighter a little than the other layers; and the length of the layer according to how it lies on the member in greatness and smallness; and then you should tighten over the layers with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then you should tie it decently above it just as we have said about loosening, and let the tightening be less, and how much more the length of the fracture is, the less the tightening.
And let the threads be medium in thickness and thinness, and they should be of linen; and if the threads are thick, just as I have seen through the operation of many foolish doctors tying their threads with cords from a bow, and that is a great error when the tightening is not equal.
And very thin threads are not convenient, because you will not get what you want with them and let there be the thickness of a finger between each bandage.
And if the patient is hurt by the edges of the bandages, then pause below those with cotton or woolen cloth so that it does not harm him.
Sometimes the fracture is in splinters and there occurs disruption in the tendon and I come with a reminder about that in the chapter according to its uniqueness.
And know that not every broken member is tight with bandages on the first day; the cause of which is because the member when it is large, you should not pause over it bandages unless after several days or a week or more, according to your confidence in the occurrence of an ulcer.
And this is the way of the ancient doctors by which they healed those who were broken and dislocated and crooked.
Way of the emplaster which is sprinkled for healing fractures, convenient for many complications and especially for women and children, because it is that from which heat and friction are not felt: and you should take from powder of bran, and it is the membrane of the bran that comes from the movement of the millstone in the mills.
And if you can't get it like that, then you should soak it in egg white and pause the application of it not too thick nor too thin; and then use it.
Another method of healing fracture and dislocation and twisting: take asafoetida, ladanum, acacia, enula, and myrrh, which is the resin of wild balsam, of all these one drachma each; of myrrh and aloe, five drachmas each; aloes, twenty drachmas; mix them all together with alcohol of vinegar or with white of egg if the patient's complexion is scorched; and use this ointment for it is of good composition and quickly restores broken bones, and confers to many men.
Another method of ointment which confers to fracture and twisting: take myrrh and met of white poplar, one drachma each; of myrrh and aloe, five drachmas each; acacia, six drachmas; balsam of armenia, twenty drachmas.
Grind all of these ingredients in a mortar with a pestle, and then sift them, and mix them with aloe juice or egg white, and apply it.
Way to make a poultice for joints and bones that are separated from their sockets, and healing pain in those, and also for splits and fractures: take soft wool and soak it in sweet wine and olive oil, and then place it over the affected area.
May this poultice bring about restoration, stop bleeding, and ease pain effectively.
Another way to make a poultice that restores broken bones: pick leaves of the wild fig tree and leaves of the wild poppy; crush them all together and make a poultice out of them.
Way to make a poultice that brings about quick healing of broken bones and also resolves remaining bleeding: take ground aloes, camomile flowers, violets, and bean flour, all in equal parts. .ii.; Grind them all together and mix with wine if the body part is not burned.
But if it is burned, then mix it with water of coriander or with water and use it.
Another way to make a poultice that is even stronger in resolving bleeding, when it happens with broken bones: take ground aloes and licorice root, and also aniseed, fennel, marjoram, violets, camomile flowers, all in equal parts; grind them together and mix with water of celery or with water or with wine, depending on the quality of the affected body part and its color.
But Hypochlorite does not dry in its own nature, unless it is placed over the broken body part to heal it, but rather wax made of cerumen and oil, and not another cause; and it should be applied between thickness and thinness.
But it has been seen that they are placed over the broken body part to heal it and the causes of their dryness from heat are also small as myrrh, aniseeds and other similar things to those causes which we have recounted above.
Way to make a poultice that helps injury and pain: take ash, cedar wood shavings or peacock feathers, aloes, and salt, all in equal parts; grind them together and sift them, then mix them, and make a poultice out of it.
But the amount should be according to the extent of the injury and the pain; also, if there is no pain or swelling, nor the bone broken out of its socket, then you should not use this for many days. And if there is great pain or swelling or inflammation, then you should not put any poultice on it for that hour, but wait until the pain eases a little.
And take a sponge and marine sponge, soak them in warm water, then wash the affected area with that until the swelling stops and the pain is eased; then let it rest for an hour; then place over it wool soaked in sweet wine and oil or rose oil, and let it stay there overnight if you are sure of bleeding, and that the inflammation of the affected body part is reduced, and the pain is eased.
And then repeat that gentle compression with a small poultice and don't compress it too much at first, but gently until it is healed.
And if the bleeding and the swelling and the pain and all of its accidents are already reduced completely, and you have stopped using poultices and compression, then you should do it again just as you did at the beginning equally.
And if none of the causes that we have mentioned above happen to the body part, then don't take it off but wait for three or four or five days.  .viii.; and some times it is left for 20 days, depending on how it appears to you from the poultice, as we have said, until the fracture heals, and the flesh comes together over it.
And then adjust the compression little by little, but not as much as at first, and the thickness of the poultice, according to how it has recovered.
But if you see the broken body part already dried and exhausted but not covered, then know that food is prohibited from reaching it; and then soak it with warm water again completely, once every three days; and loosen the poultice a little, and through this operation, the body part receives nourishment, and is healed quickly.
But what they do the restorers of the broken body part another way when it is not healed at first, according to how it is bent and how it has been treated, is an error according to their operation, and great fear, and if it were to be straightened by force in its sockets and moved by them.
And I have not seen any of them do that, because it is more reasonable that it does not happen.
Chapter according to: Of fractures when they happen in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their shapes are diverse, and their causes are distinct, because some fractures are caused by the impact of a staff, and the impact hits all of the bone within the skull, which is beneath the bone, just as it does in the arm, and therefore this type of fracture is called a complete elevation.
And the crack of both these fractures is large or small, and the cause is compression or crushing; and the cause is impact with a stone or hard object, and similar to them.
And this fracture is penetrating that it approaches the membrane which is beneath the bone; or it is in the membrane of the bone, and the crack of both these fractures is large or small.
And from fracture it is hollow in the bone, in the thickness of hair, and because of that this type of fracture is called capillary fracture.
And fracture is caused by impact with a stone or hard object and similar to them, which causes any lamina of the bone to enter between the fingers, and it is made in the hollow place like that happens when it happens to the fingers when there is impact and the lamina of the bone enters between the fingers.
And it happens most frequently in bodies of old men, as well as children's heads.
And all of these species of fractures are set like stars separated. And they will come to the memory of all that in their place.
And you know all these species of fractures by examination and by inquiry from them, and by the appearance of rotten flesh that is on them.
And the species of hair is known by being uncovered over the bone, and washed, and linen is laid on it, because the fracture appears black.
But in the cure of fractures, consider first the accidents of the patient, and then if you see through the accidents that indicate by manifest signification fear, as well as vomiting of cholera, extension, loss of understanding, loss of voice, syncope, acute fever, emission of humors from those, and appearance of them, and resemblance to them of the accidents in the greater dispositions, it is not healed.
And if you see accidents not running, you expect health, then you begin the cure for him.
The reason for this is that if the afflicted has come to you in the beginning as it is afflicted, and that is in the days of winter, then know that you should study the appearance of the bone before day fourteen according to all disposition.
And if it is in the days of summer, then know that you should close up the bone before day seven, having that which is under the skin be corrupted by the bandage, and that the accidents that we have recounted occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the skin covering the brain, and it is in small pieces and rotten, then know that you should insert the rotten small pieces according to what I will recount to you.
And it is that you cut the head of the afflicted, and uncover over the bone according to habit and manner to you possible according to the figure of the plague, and that it be lighter over the patient.
And if you see the detection of the bone, blood flows or pus cauterized, then you must oppose it with what is appropriate, and it is that you apply the place with fabrics infused in wine and roasted oil, and make the plague rest while the apostema is settled, and be secure from blood flows; and then begin in the circuit of the bone and in its removal.
And that is according to one of two ways of operation.
And the one way is that you insert the bone with a narrow incision like this, and this is its shape: And then administer another incision this, a little wider than that; and this is its shape:
And then administer more of the incision wider than the second.
And know that it should be due to you number of different incisions, of which some are wider than others; and some are shorter than others and are in the thickness of their extremities, and are of iron or steel.
And use them with facility in percussion over the incision so that you do not strike the head and lead that.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then know that you pierce in the circuit of it before you administer the incisions with the boring tools, which are named non-deep borers.
And they are not named thus but because those do not stop the end of the bone from that which is under it, for so that the boring tool is rounded on its end or has a margin on that which is under the head of it, acute-like margin or a small circle, which prohibits being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take of these boring tools many numbers of which each one is appropriate to the thickness of each bone, while it is to you present in all skulls of the brain whose end is acute, the quantity in length and brevity is according to the quantity of thickness of this skull.
And this is the shape of three species of boring tools: The quality of boring in the circuit of the broken bone is that you stop the boring tool over the bone and turn that with your fingers while you know that the bone is already penetrated; and then change the boring tool to another location, and pause that which is between all pierces the quantity of thickness of the thread or wire.
And then insert with incisions that which is between each pierce of the bone, and make that more subtle which you can over it in end of elevation, as we have said, while you radiate the bone, or by your hand, or by any other cause through some tools which you have prepared for that, as tweezers and forceps.
And know that you keep with total caution that the incision does not touch any cause of the brain.
And when you have circuit the bone and separated it from the brain if it is continued with it, then extract that, know that cut and gnaw that in its roughness of that which is in the bone with another tool resembling an incision, but however know that it is more thin and more subtle than the other incisions.
And if there appears any part of the small bones and rough, then take that with facility by that which is due to you of the tools; and then cure the plague with poultices and ointments which we have said.
And the other way of operation is lighter, farther from fear, which Gualia and Launcelot say by great law; and this is the speech of it: it is necessary to you in the beginning that you begin to uncover the part of the bone of the place in which there is the fracture more violent and more manifest, while when you have uncovered that part and stopped under it the end of this incision long and gentle of which this is the shape:
And the rounded part is lion and do not insert any cause, and the acute part is of it in two sides forward in length, as you see; that the rounded part be fitted to the brain with the membrane of it incisive acute in the bone.
And then pierce over the incision of one part with a small hammer while you insert all the bone with facility as it is turned, and be secure of the membrane that no accident occurs in it which you fear in any manner, and if the patient was the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he was sleeping.
Then if appears any cause annexed to the bone of the membrane in any place of bone, cut that from it with the end of the incision rounded, and loose that from it with facility, for it is loosed from it without harm and fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate within the membrane, and that which is cut off or is left of the bone is the membrane of it, and appears in it rough and small pieces, then know that you cut that roughness and loose those small pieces with razors subtle by which you have prepared the number, of diverse quantities so that it be to you possible to administer of those most convenient ones and the rightest of them according to what you are led astray by your operation that broken bone and its shape.
And know that you administer in your reason with which you cut the bone at the beginning the widest of those razors, and then use next it of the most subtle of it, and do not cease doing that according to continuity while you come to administer the most thin and the most subtle of all those.
But in each of the other small hair fractures and subtle fracture, know that you cure treatment according to what you are led astray by rectification of it.
And it is caused by not being rubbed on all those who have studied in that art. And we will now show you what we have written about large fractures.
And if the flesh is torn when you remove the bone, then take a piece of cloth according to the amount of the wound and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound; then take another piece of folded or doubled cloth and soak it in wine and rose oil and place it on top of the first piece of cloth, and do this gently over the wound so that you don't cause the wound to bleed; then apply a bandage of linen, and don't tighten it but only as much as the wound can take.
And let him stay under this treatment for one or two days until you are sure that the wound won't fester; then loosen the bandage and apply medications to remove excess moisture such as linen rags, oatmeal flour, powdered peas, and similar things.
And it is good for you to make a powder of these medications and sprinkle it on the wound, especially if they are dry; generally speaking, apply to that any medicine of such nature that it cleanses without biting.
And be careful in your treatment that the wound is clean; and let there be no putrescence or anything else on it; nor let virulence accumulate on it; for when it is applied to the membrane of the brain, it corrupts and damages it, and malicious evil happens to the patient.
And it happens in the head when the bone is cleaned and especially when the treatment of it is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; therefore, consider if these accidents happen to the patient as we have said, know that they are all deadly.
And if blackness doesn't happen except from the medicine that is applied to it, and it is because of that medicine that causes the blackness, then take honey in one part and rose oil in three parts, and soak a cloth with them, then place it over the head; and treat that with spices of healing until it is cured.
Chapter 3:
Of the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken in two pieces except in two cases: either both are upper bones or one of them is cartilage and not broken; and only pain, crookedness, and sinusitis happen to it.
But if one of the two parts is broken, then you must insert your little finger into his nose and grip that fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, so that the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you with ease, and be careful that you don't cause pain to the patient through this operation.
And if the fracture is in the upper bone of the nose and the finger can't reach it, then let the end of the nose be made small and thick.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same thing.
And let him be treated for restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and otherwise, then let him have rest from the festering wound.
And insert into the end of the nose a plug of linen cloth if the fracture is in one part, or two plugs if it's in two parts, and let there be thickness on the plug(s) of an amount that fills the crack in the nose.
And some of the ancient restorators say that the plugs should be wrapped in wool, and changed every day; but I haven't seen this; let there be instead a plug wrapped in honey comfit with oatmeal powder, and let the bone be set and the cartilage harden.
And sometimes there should be inserted into the nose, instead of plugs, a feather of a bird that is wrapped in linen cloth; and let there be such vehemence that the fracture of the nose isn' t prohibited from inspiration.
And this cause is not necessary for you; and if you want to do it, then do it, and if you want to do plugs, then do that.
And if the wound happens again, plaster the nose with cerot or with cotton soaked in wine and rose oil, or with diaquilon.
But if the wound doesn't happen again, then let there be plastered on the outside with oatmeal flour and powdered peas cooked with honey; and let there be placed over it a plug of linen, and don't wipe the nose for any reason.
But if the bones of the nose are broken with a small fracture or ground down, then split them and extract them with instruments that suit this; then sew up the cut and treat it with something that encourages flesh to grow and harden, and apply plasters as is convenient.
And if the wound happens within the nose, then let it be treated with plugs and lead tubes inserted so that it is completely healed.
Chapter 4:
Of the restoration of the mandible when it is broken.
When the mandible is broken and there is no wound on it, then be careful if the fracture is only on the outside and not broken in two and curved on the inside, then its perception is easier.
And therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, then insert your left index finger into his mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is on the mandible on the left, then insert your right index finger; and push with that the crookedness of the fracture inside with ease from the outside with your other hand; with that decently straighten it.
And if the fracture of the mandible is already separated into two parts, then let there be extension of those two parts according to straightness so that its position is possible.
And if the teeth are shaken by disruption, then strengthen those of which you expect that they will break with thread of gold or silver or of silk; and let there be applied to the broken mandible cerot, and let a doubled cloth be placed over it, and place over the cloth a great star decently made, or a sole piece as long as the mandible; and tie that under it according to how you are equipped with its application, so that it is not destroyed.
And command the patient to have rest and stillness, and let him drink wine mixed with rose oil.
And if you see that its shape is altered in any way, then let it be checked and loosened on the third day; and straighten what has been altered on it, and plaster it with oatmeal flour, with honey, or with oatmeal flour, after you have removed the cerot from it, and place over the plaster wool of linen.
And then after that dressing is placed on it and the position of the bone isn't altered, let it be left so that it's healed and the fracture strengthened; for many times this fracture has been healed in three weeks.
And if the wound happens again, then let there be done what we have said several times in its healing so that it' s healed, and let that wound be cleaned.
And if the fracture has a wound, then consider if it is split or shattered, then you be subtle so that those pieces with what suits for this in the removal of those tools.
And if the opening of the wound is small, then you should make it larger with a bloodletting needle according to the amount of your need.
Then, when you have stopped the bleeding and it does not bleed again, then open the wound if it is large; but if not, put one of the ointments that are fit for this purpose onto it and cover it until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
Of the restoration of the collarbone when it is broken.
Many times the collarbone is broken in front of the chest, and that fracture happens in one of three ways.
When it is broken, either it is separated or it is separated into two parts without any bleeding and it is easier to restore, or it happens with bleeding and it is more difficult to restore, or the fracture occurs through the skin.
And the operation on that, when the fracture is through the skin, is that you have two ministers present, so that one has the aid and follows the broken collarbone, and the other extends the neck in that direction.
Then fasten the fracture with your fingers until it is made in its form according to how it should be, and there is not a little protuberance or concavity in it.
And if you need more extension, then you should put a pillow of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit, and its size according to the amount of your need; and extend and raise the collarbone and narrow the pillow with your hand until it fastens the fracture as it should be.
And if you cannot bring the end of the collarbone to the sides outside because it is reached by the armpit, then you should have the patient lean back on his neck and place a cushion under the muscle on that side.
And the minister should press the muscle on that side towards the sides down so that the bone of the collarbone is raised up where it is in the armpit, and then you should straighten the fracture and fasten it with your fingers.
But if you feel bleeding from the collarbone and they are not stopped, then you should open it and stop those bleedings with ease.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you should make an incision on it with one of the cutting instruments which you have prepared for this purpose, after you have placed under the collarbone the instrument which serves the head; and that instrument is of wood or iron, and this is the shape of it:
And it is similar to a spoon of which this is the concavity; and its width should be according to what you need it for, according to the size of the bone or its smallness.
But its length should be according to what is possible for you in the operation; let it have two ends thus, and one end be wide and the other narrow.
And if the opening of the wound which you have incised when you have extracted the bleeding from the bone is wide, and it is certain that there will be a scab, then you should bring the two lips of the wound together with a suture.
And if the opening is small, or you fear a scab, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the quantity of the cut of the wound.
And if a scab occurs, then soak a cloth in warm vinegar and rose oil and wine, and place it on that.
And let it not bleed on the broken bone; and so that you see the patient every day, when the bandage becomes soft or you see the stake has bled, then you should straighten that and tighten the binding.
And then place the patient's pillow under his neck, and place a small cushion under the armpit on that side, so that with that the support of it is raised from that side, and therefore the fracture of the collarbone is elevated by the elevation of the muscle; or let his arm hang at his neck.
And do not loosen the bandage unless bleeding occurs in the site or a scab, until twelve days have passed.
And then renew the plaster when you have seen his face to that, and adjust the fastening and restore that and leave it until it is restored and the fracture of the collarbone is coagulated.
And it is strengthened and comfortable according to the month in 28 days, and sometimes in some people it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the shoulder.
The scapula is broken in its lateral part and not broken from it but the margins.
And then when it is broken in its middle part and not broken from it but the margins, then according to how the fracture is twisted you should prepare it and reduce it according to the natural shape in every way that is possible for you.
And then place on the site powder of wheat flour with egg white and a poultice, and then place on it a bandage of cloth doubled; and then place on it a slender stake of wood according to the quantity of the scapula or more.
But if under the stake the scapula is hollowed out in any of its parts, then you should straighten that hollow with a poultice, and then place the stake according to equality.
And then tighten above it with a long bandage with mild compression and the stake so that it is not bled from its site.
And consider the bandage every day; and whenever it becomes soft, loosen another turn and tighten it and equalize the stake if it has bled from its site.
And support the patient on his side.
And the scapula is restored in 20 days or in 25.
And then when that number is complete, then you should dissolve the bandage, and know that it is certain that there is a beginning of union of those bones from which there is not feared or their dissolution.
And if the site of the bone weighs down and there is placed under it the cord, then you should cut that, and support it, and do according to what we have said in the fracture of the collarbone about bleeding from a scab if it occurs here.
Chapter 7.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the foot.
The foot sometimes is broken in its middle part and that especially occurs at the end; but the ends of it are usually crushed and ground together.
And when the patient's lung is broken it leads to a decline in the internal parts and the occurrence of great pain, difficulty in breathing, cough, and strong vomiting of blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is revealed and not hidden from sensation.
And the restoration of the patient is that he should be supine on his back, and place a cushion between his shoulders; and press the muscles of his chest, and adjust his ribs with the hands of two assistants, and act subtly in the operation and according to all ways that are possible and convenient, until the bone returns to its shape.
And then place a plaster and wadding over the fracture site, and put on top of it a thin table made of willow or alder wood, or similar materials in levitation, wrapped in cloth; and act subtly in tying that around the broken bone so that there is no pain; and go with the binding according to the shape of the back several times, and tighten that decently with a strap; and consider the binding at all times, and when it becomes soft, tighten it.
And if necessity requires the removal of that bandage or dressing, or swelling, or pain, or abscess that occurs in the place, then you cut and loosen that, and remove the plaster and correct what occurs through the mode of cure of the patient; and then return the plaster, if possible, to its former state; and tighten the binding so that it is healed.
Chapter 8.
On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that rib fractures do not occur except in large places that follow the back; and from their ends at the front, contriction does not occur to those except through what are cartilaginous. And cognition of it is not hidden from sensation by means of inquiry with the fingers.
And the restoration is that you unite the fracture with your fingers according to the possible mode, so that it is united according to its shape; and then plaster and tighten the broken bone with splints, if needed.
And if the rib fracture is declining to the internal parts, then the patient experiences vehement pain and puncturing, just as puncturing occurs in one who has pleurisy, and it causes difficulty in breathing, cough, and vomiting of blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And the Antics are ingeniously devised for that with many ingenious things.
And from them I say: place foods that generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and extended, and the fracture is pushed to the external parts.
But we should eat that so that it is not a cause to generate an abscess, if it has not occurred; and if it has occurred, then it helps.
And some of them say that it should be placed above the windpipe and that it should draw strength; and it is like reasoning, but nevertheless it is feared that the windpipe will send the superfluities to the place due to weakness.
And some of them say: cover the site with wool that is already submerged in hot oil, and place powders between the ribs so that it is filled, and let the binding be made as round as you wrap it; and then the patient should be cured with pleurisy cure by food and medicine.
And if it causes vehement constriction on the patient who cannot bear it, and the bone punctures the membrane with piercing pain, then fear for the patient; cover the site, cut open the broken rib, and place over it an instrument that conserves the heart, the remembrance of which is preceded, so that we may insert it into the bone with ease and extract it.
And then tie the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and cure it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs within, then you cut and pour powders into rose oil and place it over the site, and let the patient be cured by that which occurs to the abscess within.
And he should be laid down on his side on which he sleeps so that it is healed.
Chapter 9.
On the restoration of fractures of the spine and collarbone.
Sometimes it is a fracture of the bones of the collarbone, and it hurts them there and the joints of the spine. And if it happens to someone and you want to know whether he will be healed or not, then consider that if you see the joints soft and stupified and dead, and they cannot move them nor tighten them, and when you press them with your fingers or puncture them with an awl and do not feel pain in those places, then know that it is not healed; and in some dispositions it is deadly.
And if they hurt and you feel constriction in those places with the fingers or puncture, then know that the joint of the bone is saved and that the patient will recover with cure.
And if you see the joints of the collarbone like this and want to know whether it will be healed or not, then consider the patient's feet.
Then if you see that they are already soft and it happens to them what happened to the joints, and then when he lies on his back, he experiences windiness and involuntary urination, and sometimes he is laid on his back and wants to urinate but cannot, then know that it is deadly, and so you should not treat him.
But if none of those happen, the cause is better and less distant.
And the cure of him is that you pierce into the abscess that you place over the fractured joint with a dropper, using either rose oil solution or crushed beans; place it on several times throughout the day so that the abscess is soothed.
And then place one of the comforting and relaxing plasters, and tighten it with a strap; and order the patient to take rest and tranquility and not sleep on the side that hurts so that he is healed.
And if it occurs due to the joint of the bone being separated from him, then cut over the cord and let the bone rest; and then unite the two lips of the wound with sutures if it is large; and then cure it with something encrusted from within the gums, so that it is healed.
But if it is the end of the bone of the hip joints and the end of the cloth, then insert your left index finger into the anus, and unite the broken bone with the other hand according to what is possible by the second mode; and then place a plaster and splint over it, if needed, and then tighten that.
And if you feel broken tendons in him, then cut over it and hold it, and cure the wound with the cure that is preceded so that it is healed.
Chapter 10.
On the restoration of the shoulder joint.
The bones of the shoulder joints hurt when they are broken, and if they are broken, then their fracture is only a conjunction in their extremities, and they are inserted lengthwise and decline to the internal parts; and it hurts the patient in that place with piercing pain.
And the restoration of him is that you extend your hand over him so that it is over the fracture as is his shape.
And if the fracture is only in its extremity, then you unite it according to what appears to you by the second mode so that it is assembled into its natural shape.
But if the fracture is in the leg or that which inclines towards the parts below, then you make the patient lie on his belly until he is prepared for the restoration of that fracture. And when you have bound that up, place a plaster on it, and also place a splint of wood or cane on it, and tighten it with a bandage so that there will be no puncturing of the fracture or removal of the splinter.
And fill the cavity with something that fills it up so that it assumes its normal shape, and command the patient to sleep on his back or on his side.
But if an abscess has occurred, then cease from its extension and restoration until the abscess is suppurated, and place on it something that promotes suppuration according to what has been mentioned before; then return to its restoration, and bind it tightly with a bandage in that way.
And if the bones have become separated or splintered, then you treat them.
Chapter 11.
On the restoration of the fracture of the hip.
The hip is what is between the armpit and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, one of which is that you take a splint of the thickness of a finger according to this form:
And let there be holes at both ends of the two splints, and let it be suspended from an elevated point.
And let the patient lie on a chair; and let him extend his broken arm over the splint until he reaches the tip of it at the point where the curve of the splint is attached.
And let someone suspend some heavy weight over it, or the assistant extend the arm downward; and then the doctor applies pressure with his hands on both sides of the fracture until the fracture goes back into place according to how it should be.
And the other way is that the patient be laid on his neck and suspend his hand from his collar with a splint; and let the doctor command two servants, one of whom holds what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other holds below the patient's arm; and each of them extends to his own side.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you tighten with a splint on the fracture and another splint above it, and let each of the two servants extend to his side.
And if the fracture is near the end of the muscle, then it should be placed halfway on the tip and the other half below the fracture beyond the armpit.
And similarly if the fracture is near the armpit, then let the splint be placed on that point and on the armpit.
Bind that up with ease and without pain, and then when it is bound according to how it should be and applied well, tighten it if an abscess does not occur.
But if an abscess occurs, then cease from tightening it until the seventh day, and place on it soft wool soaked in wine and rose oil until the abscess drains; then you tighten it.
And the way to tighten it is to place a plaster on the fracture, and then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster; and then lift up the arm on that hip, and place your open hand on his muscle.
And let the cloth and arm rest on the hip so that the arm is in its natural place, unless some cause from the broken bone prohibits it.
Then use splints.
And it is that you place on the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the others; and let there be between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers of all parts.
And then tighten on the splints with the binding which is described at the beginning of the chapter.
And let your binding on the site of the fracture be tighter. And when the fracture is longer, then let the binding be shorter.
And so if you see the position of the splints and binding as we have said in the time when you are restoring the member to its natural position, then you do this:
And if you fear an abscess, then you cease from tightening and splints for the seventh day as we have said.
And then consider the splint in all parts for three days so that nothing occurs at the point of pressure or inflammation, or that nourishment does not reach the member because of a surplus of binding; and then rectify all that according to what we have said.
But if you are certain that nothing occurs of that, then do not loosen the ligature except after three or more days.
And let the patient sleep on his back, and let his hands be over his stomach.
And place on the hip a poultice full of wool bound up, and consider all night or day that it is not loosened or dissolved nor the figure of the broken member altered, or that the binding be softened; then rectify all that with your skill.
And let the patient' s food be according to the order which we have mentioned before, so that the food is subtle at the beginning until it is started being tightened; then let the food become coarser.
The custom of the hip and the bed is that they are tightened for 40 days; then let them be loosened and a bath be administered, and it be anointed with ointments which rectify that.
And if the fracture is laid open, then you do not loosen from it the binding and splints until 10 or 2 days.
Chapter 12.
On the restoration of a broken arm.
The arm is made of two bones which are called two bones; one of which is small and is that which supports the finger, and the other is large and is that which is placed below the small finger from the part that is further away.
And usually it is only the larger bone or the smaller one that is broken.
And when the small bone is broken above, then its restoration is easier, and its healing is easier.
And when it is broken below, then the fracture of it is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken at the same time.
Therefore, if the bone which is broken is the small bone above, then it is convenient for the doctor, in order to restore it, to place a little extension with ease so that it is bound up.
But if the larger bone is broken, then let there be placed a more violent extension.
And if both bones are broken at the same time, then let you place the most violent extension.
And let the figure of the hand be according to its restoration and its extension stretched out over a pillow, and let its wrist be above the parts, more above all the other fingers, and let the finger be below all the others, and let the patient lie on his back on a inclined pillow.
And let one pillow be in front of him at an angle or straight under him so that the patient does not strain himself.
And then the assistant extends the arm of the part below with his hand or with a splint, and another assistant extends it above similarly.
And then the doctor binds the bone so that he reduces it according to the best figure that he can.
And if there are sores on the bones, then you must pierce through and reduce all pain in its place with your virtue.
And if there appears on it a separate sore that punctures the cord and is not hopeful for its restoration, then you must cut over it and treat it according to the manner we have mentioned above.
But if the fracture is with pus, I have already made a particular chapter about it, and so take its cure from that.
And if an abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then you must line a cloth with ceratum made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thin and thick, and tie the tight cloth over that so that the abscess may yield; and then remove the ceratum and place an ointment prepared from moly powder with honey, and then place stelae; and let the stela which is placed over that fracture be more pus-laden and stronger.
And know that the number of the stelae on the arm is seen in the greater dispositions, or it is a fracture in one or two joints together.
And then place your compression over the site of the fracture more strongly and more fiercely, and when you see that the compression goes to the parts above the fracture or to the parts lower down on it, stop the compression a little softer according to how it is remembered in the beginning of the chapter.
And the cloths which are wrapped over the fracture are to be soft moistened cloths, and not hard nor rough, and the thread with which it is tied must be of medium thickness between thin and thick, as we have recommended.
And consider the member and its ligament after a few days. And if there happens some cause for which a correction is necessary, such as a growth on the member, and then you see that you embrocate the member with warm water until that growth ceases.
And let the member not be constricted while it rests, and then return the compression.
And if the compression is already softened and the bone is already healed and similar to those, then correct all that with your virtue.
And consider more if the nourishment is prohibited from coming to the member because of superfluity of compression, then cover that a little and let it be for a few days until the nourishment runs to that, and then tighten it.
But if none of those causes happen to the patient, then don't untie it until about twenty days or so from those.
And then let the hand of the patient be suspended by your virtue of moving activity and make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or around 32 days, or rather it is restored strongly in 28 days, and all that is according to the disposition of the complexities and dispositions of the virtue.
Chapter 13.
Of restoration of fracture of the thumb and fingers.
Know that in the thumb of the hand and the knuckles of the fingers there are many times fractures, and not just to them but also much attrition many times.
And when there happens to the hand fracture or attrition, then cover that the patient follows sitting and in front of him lies sleeping according to equality, and then place his hand over that extended.
And then the minister extends the broken bones and the doctor apply ointment to them until they are joined with good connection.
And then cover that they stop ointment and bandage if there is no abscess cautery; and then place a stela over it according to the quantity of the site, and you have already wrapped that in a cloth of it.
But if the fracture is in the parts within the fingers near the palm, and then make like a spear of cloth, and command the patient to tighten that with his palm fractured; then let it be tightened with long cloth.
And let the stela of horn be with cloth in the one which is raised, so that the horn is applied to the palm; and tighten that according to how it covers.
But if the fracture is to the parts outward, then cover that they stop over it stelae and another stela of the part lower in the palm, so that the hand be open and straight; and then place the compression, as the hand is turned to the palm between the fingers with movements.
And if fracture happens to any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, let it be ointment according to how it covers and then let it be tightened with the palm, and if you wish, stop at it a small straight astela so that the fracture is elevated and not bruised.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, as in that of the middle, or in the index, or in the auricular, or in the ring finger, then let it be ointment and bound with the finger whose one is that; or they are all bound according to continuity, and that is better; or stop over it a small stela, as we have said in the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and then that, the disposition of abscess cautery and oppose — by your operation — with that which covers when there happens some cause of those, according to how is iterated its account of it.
Chapter 14.
Of restoration of fracture of the bone of the thigh.
The bone of the thigh many times is broken and is declared in feeling according to how it is converted to the part in front and to the highest.
And its restoration is done in that the ligament is tightened over the fracture and another ligament below the fracture, and let the patient lie on his stomach and on his face.
And then the minister extends all the ligament to its part according to its quality when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is near the root of the thigh, then let the ligament be near the back of the knee to the part of the patella, so that extension is made in them, and the other ligament below the fracture.
And similarly if the fracture is near the back, then let the ligament be made near the back, and let extension be to the parts below.
And then the doctor applies ointment to the bone with both of his hands so that he reduces it according to the natural resemblance and the bone is joined by good conjunction; and then cover that they stop ointment and compression if there is not abscess in the member. But if there happens to it abscess, then leave that for a few days until the abscess cautery yields, and then return to its cure.
Its compression is done thus: cover that you wrap over the fracture a hard bandage, and fold that two or three times, and remove from it superfluity; and then wrap the leg so that it comes to the heel and to the root of the thigh.
And interject long thread between the thigh and the leg near the back to the parts below, and let the ends of the thread come from the highest party of both parts, and then turn about the leg and the thigh that superfluity of the bandage.
And then stop over the thigh in the site of that fracture astelae, and stop of those a stela over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the vacuities between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths so that the compression is coagulated.
And then begin with strong compression of the middle over the site of the fracture by three or four wrappings, and when you see that you are alone with ligament of the site of the fracture, let your compression be minor and more slack and more moist.
Then extend both ends of the rope to the lower parts until they reach the ankle of the foot, and tighten both ends of the stars on the other side so that the ligament is not dislocated from its place.
Then place the bandage over it in such a way that there is no swelling or blistering or inflammation of the limb; and if any of those things happen for some reason, then remove it from him, and correct what happened entirely according to what we have said many times.
But if the pain is in the bone and it feels heavy, then you must dislocate it according to what is possible for you; but if not, apply a poultice on it and leave it, and cure it with that from which the preceding memory arises until it is healed.
And in some cases, this fracture of the thigh is dislocated by applying stars to it, just as we have said about the helper and the arm.
But in the restoration of him in such a way, no claudication occurs in the patient; and if he is restored alone, then it is necessary that he also has the other leg applied to it, then it is necessary that he also has the other leg applied to it, then it is necessary that he also has the other leg applied to it.
And you should know that the thigh is dislocated in 40 days or a little more or a little less, and all of that depends on the variety of the complications and other dispositions.
Chapter .xv.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Know that the fracture of the kneecap hurts here and there, but it happens to him in many ways traction.
But if it happens to him fracture, then it is nothing more than a crack or break in its parts, and that is due to plague or sesamoiditis, and on top of that, everything is due to the sensation.
And its restoration is in such a way that what is broken from its parts is healed with the said within it, until it is united and joined according to what is possible by equation and facility and fabrication.
Then apply a poultice and place on it a round star, if necessary; and tighten above with a bandage in a convenient way.
And consider all the dispositions we have recommended in other fractures, just as it is blistering and similar to those in the same way that it opposes any accident with what is convenient for it until it is healed.
Chapter .xvi.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the leg.
Know that in the leg there are two bones of which one is thick and is named after the name of the leg; and the other is thin and is called a shank.
And it happens to both species of fracture that it happens to the two bones of the arm, and for that reason, the restoration of it is done by restoration of the arm, and the operation of it is one.
And if both bones are torn apart, the leg is turned into all parts.
And if the more subtle bone is torn, the leg is turned to the front parts.
And if the thicker bone is torn, turn it underneath, and it is from those causes that you are not able to heal it.
Then administer extension and equation and ligation of the stars according to that restoration.
But nevertheless, if the fracture of the leg is jagged having many points, let the extension be less and more gentle, and draw it with your strength.
And in the leg there is some cause for operation on the arm, and it is when you dislocate the stars and complete all your operation, then you will take pieces of pine wood which are placed underneath the causes which are placed in soles, and they are made by splitting white palms; attach them to those to which there is a small thickness, and not be split from the fingers, and let the length of those according to the length of the leg, and from the knee to the lowest part.
Then wrap each one in two wraps according to the length of it, and place one on the part of the leg from one side and the other from the other side, and they are from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
Then tie the two stars in three places of two ends and at the middle place, for with this bandage the leg is prohibited from tilting to the right and left parts, and it stands in good position.
And a brace of wood according to the length of the leg is already administered; and let it be placed on it so that it conserves that from movement.
And most importantly, do this in fracture, and when you have it is plague indeed.
And consider the leg every day and study it with that from final study, and guard it from blistering and inflammation or other similar causes; and when any of those things happen, then treat him with what is necessary within so that it is healed.
Chapter .xvii.
Of the fracture of the heel and of the bones of the foot and of the toes.
Fracture does not happen to the heel at all; but to the bones of the foot it happens in some ways; and to the toes of the foot few fractures happen, and nothing happens to them except for traction in the months of disposition.
And if to the bones of the foot indeed fracture and those bones are lifted above themselves between them, then let the patient stand on his foot prepared in that way.
Then place one foot over what is lifted from those bones, and press and dislocate them within so that they turn in the places.
Then apply a poultice and place a stopper above it, and place underneath the belly of the foot a small table to which are two pegs.
Then tighten that with the foot by bandage descending, since you have wrapped it with bands and other causes from which it needs.
And when three or four days have passed, then you loosen the ligament, for you will find the bones dislocated, or torn, or broken, and the operation on them is in that way known.
But if any toes are torn, then restore them and dislocate them in the same way as you and put together to you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place to the torn toe bandage according to the length of the toe, and let it be more inclined from him; and underneath the foot that table which you have recounted to me, and tighten that with bandage descending.
But if what is torn from the bones are two or three or more, then you place on each toe a star of its quantity wrapped in linen, and tighten that table at the lowest part of the foot, and let it stand on one of the pegs of the table bore the belly of the foot so that the tongue has good retention.
And it is convenient for you to remember that you do not consider all the causes which have been mentioned to you in the other fractures of the accidents we have spoken about; and pause with each accident as it occurs.
Chapter XVIII.
Of the fracture of the pubic bone and of the bone of the penis and of the virile member in man.
When the pubic bone is broken, then have that woman lie on her back, and tilt her pelvis slightly to one side, and let her hand be held behind her.
And let the midwife fill the pubic region with cotton, and have the man's penis be made erect; and let the woman be shaken, and let her pelvis be raised little by little, for everything that is forgotten will come out before what is in front of the pubic bone, just as it was, and the broken bone will return.
And let powdered herbs be sprinkled over his back, and when he wants to urinate, wet the cotton with ease, and let him urinate; and reduce and return it according to the way in which you applied it at the beginning, and let him return to his first position.
And do this for seven days or around that, for that is restored.
And if you wish, take a bladder of sheep and insert into the wound of him a cannula of canvas; and put the whole bladder into his pubic region, and let the cannula be insufflated with vertigo so that the bladder is inflated inside the pubic region, for the fracture will return.
And let it be filled with cotton and stay for several days according to what we have recommended, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the penis in man or woman is broken, then administer to its restoration and healing what we have recommended for the bone of the hip.
And what is straight is not hidden in these proximity fractures, and few understand it, especially those who have some study and understanding of this my book; for that fracture indicates to you in the greatest dispositions a direct way in its restoration and in its stricture, and therefore understand well.
But in the virile member of man when it is broken, take a walnut shell, and put the penis into that; and let powdered herbs be sprinkled over him, and let it be wrapped up, and let it be left for three days or around that, and let it be healed.
Chapter XIX.
Of the restoration of fracture of bones when they are swollen.
It is convenient for him to whom fracture with swelling occurs, and especially if the bone is large like that of the thigh or the adductor, or similar to that, that you care for it and treat it immediately, if the conditions of phlebitis testify to you as we have said above.
And if the swelling flows with blood, then have you care for its retention in that way as you pulverize it over it with ground black thistle, if another cause is not present to you.
And let the fracture be restored on that same day, and do not prolong it, unless swelling occurs.
But if swelling occurs, then let you leave the restoration of it until the ninth day, so that the swelling may cease, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days, for you will make bad accidents occur.
But if the broken bone is prominent over the uncovered tendon, then have you reduce it and bring it down by your hands with ease and with little extension.
But if extension is not prepared for you and the equation of it by your hands, then let you reduce that by your hands with this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, whose length is seven or eight digits, and its breadth according to the quantity of swelling; and it is necessary for the doctor to take one of these three or four according to the quantity which is needed in the cure in all kinds of fracture.
And let it be round and have little thickness so that it is not bent by the pressure upon it in the hour of operation.
And let its end be acute and its edges sharp; and let it be of a thick thickness above, and of the thickness of its middle within to the ends.
And this is the form of it:
And it is named in Greek "labro volentz atelarem", thus is palette little.
So that let the acute end of it be elevated and paused over the prominent extremity of the bone.
And press it into a hollow so that the bone returns, and let it be bent with some equation.
And therefore force yourself to bend the ends of the fracture between them, and if the end of the broken bone is subtle, and does not take that instrument for a good perception, then have you insert the end of that bone so that the instrument has power of it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone in all of what we have recommended, then insert that into that which is convenient to it among the inserts which we have said; or saw that with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And let you smooth that which is rough and jagged in the bone.
And when the bone is reduced, and therefore the reduction causes great pain to the patient, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and therefore do that which you confer to the patient great benefit.
When you have completed your restoration which you do to the bone, then soak cloth in black wine, and especially if it is summer; and do not pause over the swelling ointment or other cause by which oil is made, so that swelling and decay do not occur in it.
And let you administer stars in the hour of your compliment of the restoration of the bone, and leave the swelling uncovered so that you insert the wound with tweezers and use bandages according to the quantity of the swelling.
And keep yourself in all caution so that you do not constrict the swelling with the fracture, for many times have been made by foolish doctors, and caused over their patients death or a rotting ulcer, thus is a wound. And if your constriction is long, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the swelling is great or it is bad, and you fear some evil accidents which we have recommended, and pain occurs in the place, then do not have you pause over that astelas, but do to that a covering of hard cloths in place of astelas and tighten it with those.
And when after one or two days the swelling begins to come out, let there be engendered in it a bruise, then you stay above that cloth which you have put over it with wine, and therefore administer hot waters, in which medicines are usually applied to swellings, thus with tetrafarmacon and similarly to that.
And it is convenient for you to loosen the bandage and consider the swelling every day morning and evening until it is consolidated and closed up, and let the member be prepared in such a way that the swelling runs from it to the ends below with ease.
If after several days the swelling does not become consolidated or it is not separated from it the bruise, then know that here are hidden small bones, so beware of the swelling with tent. And of those small bones which are separated and extracted, those that are not separated from it and cause the member to ache, force yourself to insert them according to what is possible for you.
And if it happens that the wound is infected with pus or becomes swollen, this indicates the presence of a foreign object, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction. In such cases, you must apply to the wound whatever treatment is appropriate, as described in the preceding chapter.
And regarding the object which caused the wound: when it is a large object that has penetrated deeply into the body and broken through the bone of the thigh or the rib cage, and resembles those objects found in the larger limbs, do not attempt to extract it, for its removal often leads to death. Instead, leave it there to fester, for it will usually fall out on its own within 20 or 30 days. And then treat the wound if you can see it; if not, leave it as is.
Chapter 20
On the treatment of nodules that appear on the site of a fracture.
This nodule often occurs on the site of a healed fracture, especially near the joints, and affects the shape of the limb; it strongly hinders the limb from performing its natural functions.
Therefore, if the nodule is recent, administer to it those medicines that have a styptic effect, such as aloe, myrrh, and gall-nut; take some or all of these, and prepare them with white wine, or vinegar, or sweet wine, and apply the mixture to the nodule using a piece of cloth, and bind it tightly in place.
And let the binding remain in place for several days without removing it; then loosen it and repeat the treatment, until the nodule is reduced in size; or press a piece of lead gently over it, since lead has the property of reducing anything that is swollen in the limbs.
But if the nodule has already turned into a stone and it is causing pain, then split it at its highest point, and drain out the pus and any other fluid that has accumulated inside it; treat this wound so that it heals.
Chapter 21
On the restoration of a fracture when it is healed, and on the subsequent return of the limb to its normal condition, without any deformity.
When a bone fracture is healed, and the limb regains its normal condition without any deformity, this happens due to several causes: one cause is excessive fluid retention in the ligament and the failure to properly bind it; another cause is excess swelling of the ligaments, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or excessive movement at an inappropriate time; or a deficiency of blood in the patient's body, or weakness.
The treatment for this is to encourage the patient to eat and make their heart strong, so that blood flow is increased in them; administer a bath; and apply poultices of marjoram and lettuce over the affected area.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that it draws nutrients to the area; or continue to apply warm water to it, until the flow of nutrients is restored and the limb returns to its normal shape.
Chapter 22
On the treatment of fractured bones that are healed in a crooked position, and prevent them from returning to their normal condition.
When a healed bone is crooked and there is nodule formation, causing distortion in the shape of the limb, but the limb can still function normally, then you must not accept the word of someone who claims that this limb has recently been fractured.
But there are some foolish doctors and surgeons who have performed this operation in our land, and it is a very reproachful practice, causing great fear, the sign of which is fatal.
But if the claudication and nodule are recent, then they should be bathed in tepid water containing soft herbs, such as mallows and plantain leaves, and mallow-root, and similar ingredients; or a poultice should be made with sweet almond oil, or with soap made from olive oil and white lead; or fat figures should be bound to the affected area using the feathers of a young pigeon, and similar remedies from among those mentioned earlier as consolidents.
And sometimes it is dissolved by continuous gentle friction with the hands that are moistened, and the limb should be moved to all sides at all times.
But if the crookedness has progressed further and has become a stone, requiring treatment with iron, then the pus should be drained first, and the bone should be softened by dissolving any nodule with subtle incisions, and the area should be treated with gentle manipulation and attention.
Chapter 23
On speech in dislocation.
Dislocation is the separation of a joint, causing the limb to be unable to move, and the shape of the limb is altered, bringing great pain and severe injuries to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it must be reduced immediately and not delayed, for if it is delayed, the joint will become inflamed, and its reduction will then be very difficult.
And for that reason, it must not be bent or twisted during the process of reduction, for this often causes spasms and pain.
But when this happens, the patient should be given a bath, and then the affected area should be left to rest until the swelling subsides; and the limb should be bathed in warm water with oil, and then reduced gently.
And every limb should be treated according to its location.
And I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, following those on fracture, from the highest part of the body to the lowest.
Chapter 24
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two jaws are dislocated if they do not meet; and their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they are displaced from their joints by a small amount, and are then slightly softened; or they are fully dislocated, causing them to be displaced at the joint where saliva flows from the patient' s mouth, and their teeth cannot meet, and their tongue is wrapped around their words.
But when their dislocation is slight, they usually return to their proper position for the most part, due to some minor cause.
But if the dislocation is complete and full, then it must be reduced immediately, and not delayed in any way.
And the minister should hold the patient's head, and the doctor should push one of his fingers into the root of the dislocation of the jaw inside the mouth, if it is dislocated on one side; or he should insert both of his fingers simultaneously, if it is dislocated on both sides, while the other fingers are wrapped around the outside; and command the patient to open his mouth and loosen the jaws.
And if its reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are fully dislocated, then the jaw should be bathed in warm water with oil, so that their reduction is made easier, and their reduction should not be delayed at all, as we have said.
And when they have returned and are engorged, and the mouth of the patient is closed and not loosened, then place on those powders of cloth a cerot, made of wax and rose oil; and it should be bound with gentle ligatures.
And let the patient sleep on his back, and his head should be between two pillows, so that he does not turn to the right or left; and do not force him to chew anything for any reason; while his food should be meat of a lion, until when the pains are relieved and the jaws are swollen, then he can do as he pleases.
And this should be administered with gentleness, and he should not work hard or exert himself through speaking, eating, drinking, or opening his mouth wide, until the jaw is swollen and healed.
And if it is difficult to reduce both mandibles when they are dislocated at any time and not returned to their places, then often many complications arise, such as fever, constant sweating, the stomach of the patient becoming very hot, and vomiting pure cholera.
And when you see this, then know that it is dangerous; and often the one who experiences this dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
On the reduction of a dislocation of the collarbone and of the extremity of the muscle.
The collarbone is not dislocated on the inside by its connection to the foot; and sometimes it is dislocated on the outside, and this is indicated by sensation.
And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. And then press the joint with your palm with a strong compression, for it will return.
And then place on that an ointment and powders and strengthen that.
But the extremity of that which is connected to the head and continued from it, is not dislocated at any time; then it must be reduced and engorged according to what we have said and according to how you are prepared.
And then place on that an ointment, powders, and a bandage, and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
And by this method of treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its joint.
Chapter 26.
On the reduction of a dislocation of the muscle.
Know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated at the nipple towards the bottom.
And the second is that it is dislocated above the muscle, and this happens rarely; and it is not dislocated at the back by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in front by the nerves.
And mostly it is dislocated and exits outward at the bottom by the nipple, and mostly in those whose flesh is thin, it is dislocated easily; but in those in whom there is much flesh, it exits with difficulty.
And often it happens to some men due to a blow or fall, and the muscle of them is pustularized by pustules, and is cured by that which has already dislocated it.
So therefore know this while you are above him, and then proceed in his curing.
And the dislocation of it is known when it is at the bottom by the nipple; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the intact muscle, for you will see a marked difference between them; and you will see in the head of the muscle a concavity and below the nipple towards the touch of the head of the muscle as far as an egg, and the patient cannot reduce his hand to his ear, nor move that by any motion.
If it is dislocated above or below, and you will see a marked touch, and it is not hidden.
And from this dislocation there is made an easy reduction when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And its reduction is that the minister raises his hand above; and then place your fingers below the nipple of him, and raise the joint with strength above to its place, and the minister raises his hand and extends that above; and then place that below so that it returns easily.
But if by what we have said it does not return, and so from the beginning that the dislocation occurred, after many days, then know that the patient should be bathed in warm water and be administered embrocation which softens and lubricates as though his joints were razor-sharp, and fenugreek, and honey in water, and be administered.
And then the patient should lie on his back and place below the nipple of him a pad of wool that is engorged between compression and relaxation, and then the doctor places his heel over the joint, and raises the head of the muscle with force, and pulls the hand of the patient so that it is not turned downward, and another minister holds the head of the patient so that it is not turned downward, for then that will return to its place at once.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this manner: and it is that you make present a man who is longer than the patient, and stand on his side, and insert the muscle of him below the nipple of the patient and raise the nipple of him above while the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister pulls the hand of the patient from the bottom of his belly. But if the patient is thin, then know that with him or another cause suspended, by gravity it returns at once.
And it is reduced according also to another manner: and it is that there is placed on the ground a post whose head is rounded in shape, like mortar, which is not thick nor subtle, and then place below the patient; then place over the head of the post lion cloths, and let the patient stand according to the length of the post, and then extend his hand from the bottom of the other part with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
And if it is difficult to reduce it by all the causes we have said, then use this cure: and it is that you take a post whose length is two cubits, and its width is four digits, and its thickness is separated in the nipple according to this form:
And then over the rounded head there are tied lion cloths so that the patient does not slide.
And then place below the nipple of the patient, and let his hand or arm be extended over the post to the bottom, and let the post be tied over the helper, and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then place the arm over a rung of a ladder according to its width, and let the hand be extended to the bottom, and let the other body be suspended from the other side, for the joint will return at once.
And when the instrument of him is completed according to any manner that it is possible for you, then know that you place below the nipple a pad of wool of equal quantity; and then place ointment prepared from ground moli with honey over all the muscle, as far as it is turned above, and then bind below the nipple with a bandage moderately tight; and let the bandage be turned over the ointment, and let his hand be joined to his neck, and let him be bound, and not moved his hand for seven days.
And once the patient's food has been reduced, as long as the member is comfortable, it is closer to being healed.
Then food should be given in greater quantity and the patient exercised; if it is closed and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to moisture that happens to it or for some other reason, then three punctures should be made on it, as already mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the ligament is loosened and the joint not closed, and the poultice and the binding are removed from it several times, and it is not closed and the skin not closing and unable to lift that arm up towards the parts above, then know that its nerves which are at the head of the muscle are either severed or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never return to its place.
From the dislocation of that which is made from the foot and the breast or the parts behind, the reduction is made by impulsion and extension with the hands, until it returns.
And let the other binding be administered on that, and heal it as long as it is healed.
And if the healing becomes heavy on the member and delayed in its movement, then let the patient take many baths until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its first nature.
Chapter .XXVII.
On the curing of dislocation of the elbow.
Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated to all parts, and especially to the front part from the back part, and its dislocation is not concealed from you because when you try to bend the dislocated elbow towards you or away from you depending on how it is dislocated, this will be made manifest to you, for the joint is hollowed out and cannot bend the arm or touch with that muscle.
And if you see that the elbow is dislocated and you reduce the dislocation at once before it comes to an ulcerated wound, for if it comes to an ulcerated wound, its reduction is difficult, and most often it does not heal at all; and especially when it is to the back part, for it is worse than all other species of dislocation, and more painful, and many times leads to death.
And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce, is that the hand of it be stretched with two hands, and the arm of it expanded, and the doctor's hands on the elbow and under it, and he pushes the joint together with his fingers or the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is to the front part, then it returns thus that he bends the hand with his hand, while striking the elbow with the root of his palm.
And if the dislocation does not obey reduction, then administer vigorous extension and great force.
And two ministers are to hold that joint while it is being extended so that it is not pulled back by the extension.
And then let the arm be rotated on all sides, for it is wrapped in a long folded cloth over the hand or ligament.
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, he should smear it with some oil so that it causes the cause of the joint to be helped by ease of lubrication with facility; and then push the joint together with strong impulsion until it returns.
And then its reduction should be that the poultice in which it is wrapped with stiptic and astringent albumen of egg white, and it being tightened by descent binding, and the arm suspended from the neck, and let go for several days.
And then it should be loosened; and if the joint is formed in its place, then you loosen its binding and leave it.
And if you see the joint not to be stronger, then you iterate the poultice and binding, and leave it for several days until it is tightened; and then loosen it.
But if it happens to it heaviness after the reduction of the joint, and its disposition is in movement, then administer moisture in bath and subtle friction, and compression, until it is relieved; or pause over the joint all-night-oil, as it is grease of motion; and then let it be bound, and leave that on the bone the day and night. And then wash that off, and let him take a bath; and when he is bathed, you rub the joint with tempered friction, and then iterate over it all-night-oil, as it is rose-oil of motion, once, and the second, and the iii.a., Corruption has already occurred on the nerve through the instrument of bathing, unless it was limited.
And if you want, pause over that cow's udder moistened with wine and heat over it; and do that several times, for that is moist and reduced to its disposition.
Chapter .XXVIII.
On the curing of dislocation of a mallet, that is of the joint which is between the arm and hand.
The hand some times is dislocated, and the reduction of its dislocation is easier, but it is contrary with other joints; however, when there is swiftness in its reduction at the hour that it is dislocated, before the place becomes ulcerated or that an ulcerated wound occurs on it.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the joint of the mallet on a table and the minister extends the hand of him, and the doctor pauses his hand or his palm over the impendence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns to its place.
But however, let it be considered if the palm is already turned to the belly of the hand, then the mallet should place both hands on a table because of extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is before the palm of the hand, then the position of the hand of him intrinsecly over the table, so that the hand of the doctor rests on that impendence of the joint.
And then if it returns at once, good; and if not, then loosen that with poultice, letting it go; and do not repeat that, for unless it passes on it days, you will not suffer nor be able to reduce it.
But however, let the joint be reduced according to its tortuosity; and do not trouble the mallet for any cause, unless the hand is softened and not able to strengthen for any cause; then know that the nerves are severed or torn, and then it does not have strength in it except when it is tightened with cautery close to the joint of it and very often that confers no cause.
Then when the mallet is returned, then pause on it the poultice which we have recommended, and let it be left and tightened for several days; and then loosen it and let the hand of him be exercised.
But if its movement is stopped and any heaviness happens to it, then loosen that with water and with friction several times, until it is relieved.
Chapter .XXIX.
On the curing of dislocation of the fingers.
Sometimes they are completely displaced.
And when any of these fingers are dislocated on the back of the hand or on the belly, then press the finger and push out its dislocation with your thumbs, while returning it to its position.
Then hold the head of the finger and suspend that part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it while straightening it on that day.
And when morning comes, apply that narrative again, and do not cease loosening it during the day and exercising with movement, and apply it at night; and do this for several days until it is tight.
And do this similarly if it is dislocated on the belly of the hand, and apply that narrative to that part and do your first operation with it until it is healed.
And similarly do for when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter 30.
Of the cure of dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation occurs in any of the vertebrae of the back or neck and many vertebrae have left their places, then there is no cure for that, for death overtakes the patient.
And the sign of this is that the patient's excrement escapes without their will, and they cannot retain it; and many times some members of them or both legs of them or both arms of them, or one of those, are deadened, because many times a vertebra has left its place and many times there is removal of those to four parts.
So that is already deadened in the back parts and is named paralysis.
But its cure is that then you consider if the paralysis occurred from youth, because in that there is no cure nor any healing of that at all.
But in that which comes from falling or from beating or similarly to those, the Ancients have already described the methods of cure with a lengthy speech, of which the most returns with profit; but I and shorten that from which little excuse of it from its excess for me, because of my proximity to my intention my exposition, by which I have already exposed and formed from diverse instrument of that by which I will show and spread that.
And of those there is no cure except that which occurs properly in the back by that which I relate.
And it is that the patient be extended on his face over a pillow propped up near a wall, and be extended under him instrument wet so that his feet are not bound.
And then a straight stick be placed, set in the ground at the end of the pillow around the head of him, and another stick in the air under his feet at the other end of the pillow.
And the minister hold the stick, and it not be stopped in a pit; and another minister hold the other second that form.
And then wrap around the head of the patient and under them tickle with a lion tail; and extend the end of the tail to the stick by which it is supposed the head of him, and apply that on him; and then tighten all the tails and apply those on the other stick by which it is supposed the feet of him.
And then the ministers each extend the tail to the end of the stick, and not be deadened the two sticks and the tails in their locations in which they are placed, but nevertheless do not stop them as we have said.
And the doctor places his palms on the vertebra with strength until it returns, or that he places on a table, and then he adjusts over the table his feet until he returns.
But if he does not return by this form, then take a table of which the breadth or the length is in the air at three arms' length, and dig into the wall of which we have said that it is near the patient a place in which between the end of the table. And then place the middle of the table on the vertebra, and the doctor places his feet on the other end, and tighten so that the vertebra is cramped and returns to its location.
And if you want, open by a turn which is wound with the hand; and it is that you place on the ground beneath the head of the patient at the end of the pillow two sticks, the length of which is one arm, and place the head of him in the end of the pillow two sticks; and let the length be between each stick one palm, and it is already made in each stick a hole in which turn, and each be very stopped on the ground so that it not be deadened.
And let there be a round stick in which is the turn, and it is wound in the two holes of the two sticks.
And in its end is a hole in which the stick is formed, the length of which is one palm by which it is wound; and in the two other sticks is similarly.
And then tighten the tails which you have tightened on the feet of the patient in the hole by which it is supposed the head of him, and the tails which you have tightened on his thighs in the turn by which it is supposed the feet of him.
And then each turn and stand a minister who twists the turn with his hand, and the doctor smooths the vertebra as we have said.
And then when the vertebra has returned and the location is smoothed, then cover that with plaster of egg white, and then stop; and then place over the plaster a cloth of table of which the breadth is three fingers or more, and the length of it is quantity that takes up the location of the paralysis, and over the end of the vertebra its.
And then let it be tied with a tail as we have said, and use the patient of subtle food until he is healed.
And if any swelling remains in the location at the end of the healing, then cover that with medicines that soften and spread by administration of the table for a long time, which we have recommended; and it is administered in that location leaf of lead.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it is seized by that dislocation; and it is that bone which already swells so that it not be made projection to him by this medicine, because strongly he will do to you occur death.
Chapter 31.
Of cure of hip dislocated.
Know that the joint of the hip and the joint of the muscle do not deviate but dislocation only, and it does not occur to those that occur to the other joints of small removal and concavity.
And the joint of the hip is dislocated according to four ways, because it is dislocated at the ends inside, or at the ends outside, or at the ends in front, or at the ends behind.
And most often it is dislocated at the ends inside, and seldom at the ends in front or at the ends behind.
And the sign of its dislocation at the ends inside is that when you press the healthy hip with the sick, it is longer and the tendon is more prominent than the healthy, and the patient cannot bend his leg because of the lengthening, and it is the location which they say the lengthening of the tendon causes apothema cauter, so that the head of the hip has already come here.
And the sign of him to whom this dislocation happens is that his parts are bent outward, and that his accidents are contrary to this accident.
And the sign of him to whom dislocation happens in front is that he stretches his leg according to his ability, but still feels pain where there is pain; and if he attempts to walk and cannot go forward in front, and his urine is retained and his testicles are swollen, and he has difficulty walking on the ball of his foot.
And the sign of him to whom dislocation happens in back is that he cannot straighten his leg or bend the testicles forward, and his leg is shorter than the other, and the testicles are softened, and the head of the thigh points to that location.
But the reduction of this dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and ancient, that it has been long since it was contracted, and that you should not administer reduction to it, but only when it has been recently contracted; then there is no need for poultices.
But in him whose dislocation is recent, and is one of the four species of dislocation, then you go to that which turns the joint and extends it within and without, and from both right and left, for he will quickly return and does not need other treatment.
But if it does not return in this way, then you must prepare to extend the leg of him from the lowest part, or with his own hands, or by means of a bandage which is tied over the leg above the thigh; and another extends his hand of that one above the ankle so that he may put his fingers under the toes; and another tightens a lion skin around the root of the thigh, and let another minister hold the end of the lion skin.
And it should be extended either from within to the anus, or from behind to the navel.
And all of these should be extended in one sitting while the patient is elevated from the ground and his leg hangs down.
And this species of extension is common to all four.
And therefore if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary to all species that we speak of the proper treatment.
In the proper reduction of it, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is within, let the patient be laid on his side; and then place the lion skin over the root of the thigh in that place between the head of the thigh and the location below the testicles; and then extend the lion skin above the ankle to the highest part of the breastbone.
And then another minister should take hold of his arms and press the thick part of the bad thigh and extend to the outside by violent extension, for it will return to its place.
And this species is the quickest cure by which that member is reduced compared to the other species.
But if he is stubborn towards you and does not obey this species of treatment at all, then let his two feet be bound together with a strong bandage, quickly, over both balls and both thighs.
And let the length of each of his parts be the quantity of four digits, and let the bad thigh be extended more than the other by a quantity of two digits.
And then let the bad leg be suspended over the head of the beam and be in the middle; and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
And then command a strong young man to lessen the head of the thigh, and let another young man suspend it, and the other young man lessen the thigh with strength push, for the joint will return to its place with speed.
But in the proper reduction, when it is dislocated outside, let the patient lie on his back according to what we have recommended regarding the swelling; and let the lion skin be tightly applied over the bad thigh properly and over the feet of him.
And then let two beams be placed, one under his feet and the other under his head; and then let beams be placed close to the middle of the pile upon which dampened cloths are wrapped, so that the bad leg is not harmed by the beam being between his thighs, so that the extension below is not pulled.
And then each minister should extend to his part, and the doctor with his hand should direct the reduction according to the article.
And when the dislocation is in front, then let the leg be extended quickly, and it is according to this narrative on the pile; and the doctor let the palm of his right hand rest over the testicles, and then tighten that with his other hand, and with that tightening let him extend that to the lowest part towards the navel.
And if the dislocation is behind, then let the bad leg not be extended to the lowest part and let it be elevated above the ground; but let him lie on a hard cause, likewise as if his thigh is dislocated outside towards two beams according to what we have said about the sitting of him on two beams; and let him lie on his back and the lion skin be extended, likewise as we have said, no doubt.
And let compression be administered with a table over the location at which the joint goes.
Therefore when the reduction is complete according to what you have — and the sign of the reduction of him is not hidden from you, and it is that you extend two thighs, and when you see those bumps and the bad leg stretch its thigh and expand likewise without excuse, then know that the member according to which it has returned — and then you adjust two thighs and apply poultice and tighten with bandage thus so that the thigh is not bent in any of the parts; and let the bad leg rest for three days or four.
And then loosen the lion skin and the poultice, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see those bumps in truth, then know that the dislocation is already stopped, and then let the bad leg walk.
And if you see any cause of softening, then return and poultice that, and tighten that according to your first extension, and let him rest for three days.
And then loosen that, and let him delay walking on it for several days, within which he is comforted.
Chapter .xxxii.
Of the cure of dislocation of the testicles.
The testicles are dislocated according to three ways, for it is dislocated outside and inside and below but not behind; and in front it is not dislocated.
And the sign of dislocation of him is that you command the bad leg to apply his thigh to his thigh; then know that the testicles are dislocated.
And the restoration of all his ways is that you make the bad leg straight, thus so that it extends its thigh, if it can above that; adhere your two arms to his face, and let him place his foot between his feet; and then let him adhere the testicles with your palms, and press those between your fingers over the testicles of him with strength, and another minister extend his foot thus so that the testicles return to their place.
And a sign that the patient is improving is when their bed does not adhere to the mattress with effort.
Then plaster that area and attach the bed to the mattress, then bind those areas with a bandage for three or four days, then loosen them.
And do not let the patient walk for several days until they are healed and comfortable.
But if you cannot reduce the dislocation, then administer strong extension with instruments of which mention was made in the treatment of the hip.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of a dislocation of the talus.
The talus is sometimes dislocated by a small displacement and sometimes dislocated according to its completion; its dislocation can be made either within or without the parts.
And a sign of its dislocation is that you will see the talus swollen in the direction of the part to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment for a small displacement of this is gentle reduction; it should be extended easily with the hands and bound until it returns.
But in the treatment of this when it is dislocated according to its completion, you should make the patient lie on his back; then have a strong servant pull firmly upward from behind at the patient's ankle in the middle of that location.
Then you should have your right hand hold the foot of the highest part and your left hand hold the lowest part of the foot at the location of the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand and twice with the left, then extend with the left; push the bottom of the foot with your right hand towards the bed in front of the thigh.
And do this twice according to what we have told you.
Then push the bottom of the foot against the bed on the third attempt; then you are at the ankle.
So if it returns in one or two attempts according to this method and you see the foot swelling, that is good; but if not, then repeat the operation, for it will return.
But if you cannot reduce it by what we have commanded, then let the patient lie on his back on the ground, and tie a rope firmly to the ground, and place it between the patient's thighs; then you have wrapped a cloth around him so that he does not slide.
Then let one servant hold the patient's thighs and another extend the foot with their hands or with an instrument they have placed over the neck of the foot; then each servant should extend against the other, and the rope be pulled between the patient's thighs so that his body is not drawn to the lower parts due to the extension.
Then let the doctor hold the dislocation with his hands; then let another servant hold the healthy thigh at the lower parts, for the dislocation will return with ease.
And so when the dislocation returns and you see that it is healed by the reduction of it, then apply plaster and extend it with strong instruments, and bind the foot to the bed.
And beware of the nerves which are behind the talus, so that the instrument over it is not violent and does not strike it forcefully.
Then leave it for two or three days; if the instrument softens, loosen it.
Then loosen it on the third day or fourth; then forbid the patient to walk for 40 days. But if he is forced to walk within that space, it is not safe that the dislocation is not dissolved and ruined, and then what treatment is not received.
And if an ulcer occurs to him, then you should administer in the healing of it what we have commanded before, in another place for treatment and brothy, so that it is heated.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocation of the toes of the feet.
Let that which is dislocated be swollen with little extension without effort; and that which is difficult, first be gentle.
But if the dislocation is in some part of the top of the foot, then let the patient lie on their back over something flat on the ground or on a table, and be lying as if they were walking.
Then you stand on your feet and place your foot over that which protrudes from the joints; then press that with your foot with force so that it returns; then see that it is already swollen and does not appear as a protuberance in that location.
Then place under the bottom of his foot a board which covers all of the foot, to which are two ends, and then tighten that with decent and firm pressure for three days; then loosen it and let him rest from walking for several days so that it is relaxed and its reduction is assured.
Chapter 35.
On the species of dislocation which are made with splint or with fracture or with any other impression.
When any of those things happen and you are expert in the treatment of that and in the restoration of it, many times death succeeds.
And therefore you should not presume over the treatment of it, but that which is wise in the art, from long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not hasty or presumptuous; and use in the beginning of medicines which produce ulcers cauterized only, and let the patient go to divine judgement, unless you hope for salvation from destruction, with some relief of illness, and in which there appears some hope. And then effort to make the reduction of it at the beginning of the cause, before it produces an ulcerated cauterized.
And then if the member returns according as we want, then administer a regimen which yields an ulcerated cauterized and cures the splint with what is convenient for it from the dry ointments.
And if the dislocation is with fracture and occurs in the bones separated, then you are expert at their binding, and do in that which we have said in the simple illnesses of those.
And beware and avoid according to your strength that of the instrument in ways of fear according as you are preceded by my prediction; for that is better for you to your Creator, and more permanent to your glory, and more healthy to see those in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis perfectly of which God be blessed. Amen.
