 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.
On cutting for chemosis and superfluous flesh in the eye.
 Sometimes in the eye of certain people a red granulation grows up and increases so as to block the pupil or nearly so; or it grows over the eyelids and often turns the lids outward, and it resembles the blossom of the pomegranate.
You operate for this by having the patient put his head in your lap; then he opens his eyes and you gather up the granulation whole, with suitable hooks, or hold it with tweezers or forceps.
Then you cut away the first bit of flesh and then the next, until you have cut it all away; and beware of damaging the eye in the course of operation.
Your incision should be made with the scalpel which we described for the incision of pterygium; or with small scissors like those with which one gathers up pannus, as shown in the chapter after this.
And when you have finished your incision and removed all the chemosis, fill the eye with powdered salt or instil the red powder or similar corrosive; and apply to the outside of the eye cotton wool with white of egg to ward off an abscess.
If there is any chemosis left and blood is getting the better of you and you fear an abscess, then desist and treat the eye with those means for settling a tumour.
Thereafter return to your operation till cured.
 So must you do with superfluous flesh that arises in the eye.
But you must avoid treating surgically any eye that is weak, whether congenitally or by acquired disease.
Never set your hand to an operation of this kind till you have seen if the organ can endure such an operation.
