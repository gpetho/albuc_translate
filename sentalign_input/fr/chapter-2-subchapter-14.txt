About the flesh that comes in the eye
This disease which is beneath, truly called "axacrati," is both natural and accidental. The accident comes from a wound and a cut and a cautery and similar things; and the way to proceed in this is that you take a needle, with a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes in two ends of the flesh; then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
And if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, that is good; if not, then take a razor and place it in the cut, and turn the eyelid, and make two cuts on the inside of the eyelid; and let the ends of the two cuts be at the two corners of the incision that you have made, and let it form an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "gamma"; then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its edges are sharpened below, from what follows the eyelid, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread; then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines, and tents, until it is healed.
And if the disease comes from a cut or a stitch or a cautery, then you must make a full cut below the hairs of the eyelids, and according to what is mentioned before; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and the procedure must be done according to the shape of the disease, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master prepares the best method of his ability to return the shape to its natural form; and the patient himself, according to what is necessary for the procedure and instruments in many cases.
