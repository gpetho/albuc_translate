On the Cauterization of Ear Pain	On cauterization of pain in the ears.	0.8323865
When pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with laxative measures and other treatments described in the section, and the pain persists, then ignite the cautery iron, which is called "puncta", of which this is the form:	When the ear gets a pain from the cold and is treated with laxatives and other medicine as mentioned in its section and the pain nevertheless persists, heat the cautery termed 'punctate'.	0.8286322
Then mark close to the ignition, and move it around the entire ear as if revolving a wheel, or in the circuit of each segment if the pain is in each one. Extend yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear little by little after marking the spot with a probe.	Then after it has been heated prick with it in a circle right round the ear, or around both if there is pain in both, after the place has been marked with ink; the cauterizations being a little away from the ear.	0.77603906
If the cautery has ten points in the entire ear, or nearly so, treat the spots until they are healed.	Let the cauterization be of ten punctures or thereabouts round each. Then dress the places till healed.	0.65110487
