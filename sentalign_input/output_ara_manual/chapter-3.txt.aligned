This chapter is also among the most essential things needed in the practice of medicine, and it is the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in the bones.	This third part of the book, too, is an essential necessity in the practice of medicine; it concerns the setting of the fracture or dislocation occurring in bones.	0.79160285
Know, my sons, that this chapter is also claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never perused a book of the ancients on it, nor read a word of it.	You should know, my sons, that ignorant practitioners and laymen and those who have never turned the pages of a single book of the Ancients about it, nor studied a single letter of it, arrogate this part of the art to themselves.	0.76922
For this reason, this art of science has become extinct in our country, and I have never met anyone at all who is proficient in it. I have only learned from it what I have learned through long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them until I extracted knowledge of it from them, then I adhered to experience and practice throughout my life.	For this reason this section of the science has died out in our parts; I have myself found no one competent in it; and whatever skill I have, I have derived for myself by my long reading of the books of the Ancients and my thirst to understand them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them. Then through the whole of my life I have adhered to experience and practice.	0.88473356
And I have depicted for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses. And my experience with it has passed, after I have brought it closer to you and purified it from the branches of prolixity, and abbreviated it to the utmost brevity, and clarified it to the utmost clarity, and depicted for you in it many images of the instruments that are used in it.	So now I have described for you in this book all that my knowledge has encompassed on the subject and that my experience has encountered; I have made it accessible for you and rescued it from the abyss of prolixity; I have reduced it to a brief outline; and have explained it most clearly. I have made for you many drawings of the instruments that are used in it, which is an adjunct to explanation, as I did in the two previous books.	0.8387916
As it increases clarity, as I did in the two preceding chapters.  And there is no power except in God, the Most High, the Great.	I have made for you many drawings of the instruments that are used in it, which is an adjunct to explanation, as I did in the two previous books. And there is no power save in God the High, the Great.	0.68737996
