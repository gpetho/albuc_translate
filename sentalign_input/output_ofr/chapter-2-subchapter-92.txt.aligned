of worms that are born between skin and flesh This disease is called in our land "ox disease," because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm that arises between skin and flesh, and travels throughout the whole body ascending and descending, and one feels it well as it moves from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and jumps out;	This complaint is called by us in some regions 'the cattle disease' since it frequently happens to cattle. It is in fact a small solitary worm generated between the skin and the flesh, that creeps all over the body, both up and down; it can be felt as it creeps from one part to another until it breaks out at a place where it can break through the skin, and out it comes.	0.8464649

But if it burrows into the tissues and you cannot locate it, then apply the actual cautery to the place until you have burnt the worm.	0.6844838
and the greatest harm that it does is that it infects the eye, as we have said;	The greatest damage to be feared from it is damage to the eye, as we have said.	0.80489814
