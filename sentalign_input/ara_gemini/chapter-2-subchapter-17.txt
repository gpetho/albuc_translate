Chapter seventeen on cutting the warding and what grows of excess flesh in the eye.
Red, overlapping flesh may grow in the eyes of some people until it covers the pupil, or comes close to it, or overflows onto the eyelids.
And sometimes the eyelids turn outwards, and it resembles a pomegranate flower.
The procedure for this is to have the patient place their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and you pick up all of that red flesh with suitable small hooks, or grasp it with tweezers or forceps, then cut the flesh bit by bit until it is all gone by cutting, and be careful of the eye so as not to harm it during the procedure.
Your cutting of it should be either with the scalpel that we described for cutting the pterygium, or with small scissors like those used to pluck hairs, as their image will appear in the chapter following this chapter.
Once your cutting is complete and all the fleshy growth is gone, fill the eye with crushed salt, or drip into it red vitriol and similar corrosive medications, and apply cotton with egg white on the eye from the outside to prevent hot swelling.
If any of the fleshy growth remains and the bleeding overwhelms you, and you fear hot swelling, then leave the eye and treat it with something that soothes the swelling, then return to it with the procedure until it heals.
And likewise do the same with the excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type, except that you should avoid treating any eye that is weak by nature or by accidental cause with iron instruments.
And do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that the organ can tolerate that procedure.
