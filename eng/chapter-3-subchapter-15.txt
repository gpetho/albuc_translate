 CHAPTER FIFTEEN.
On setting a fracture of the patella of the knee.
You should know that the patella is rarely fractured, but crushing often occurs.
If a fracture does happen to it, it will be either a splitting or a shattering which may be simple or compound; and all these can be palpated.
Now the way to set is for the separated parts of it to be put right with the fingers, so that they unite and join as far as straightening and gentleness and skill can serve.
Then apply the plaster and put upon that a circular splint, if need be, and over that a suitable bandage.
Then keep an eye on it for all the conditions described for the other fractures, such as an effusion and the like, meeting whatever arises with what is good for it, until it is healed.
