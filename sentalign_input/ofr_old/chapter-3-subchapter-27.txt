Of the dislocation of the elbow  
Know that the elbow joint is rarely dislocated, and rarely returns; and it is dislocated in all directions, especially front and back, and the dislocation is not hidden, for it is easily seen and felt; and dislocates in different ways.  
And when you compare the sick elbow with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is displaced, and he cannot bend his arm or touch his shoulder with it.  
And it is necessary to reduce it before a hot abscess appears, for if a hot abscess comes, it will be difficult to reduce; and possibly it cannot be completely reduced, especially when it is at the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is more painful, and possibly leads to death.  
And the treatment is, when it can be reduced, to extend the patient's hand with both your hands; and his arms spread out, and the practitioner's hands around the elbow, above and below, and push the joint with your thumbs together, or at the base of the palm, until it returns to its place.  
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pushes from the base of the palm the elbow that is dislocated.  
And if it does not return to its place, then apply strong extension; and this is when two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension; then twist the arm in all directions, after wrapping it in a long and wide doubled cloth.  
And when the practitioner has aligned the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly until it returns.  
And when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm from the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days, then untie it.  
And if the joint is firm in its place, untie the bandage and leave it; and if you see that the joint is not tight, reapply the plaster and the bandage, and leave it for a few days, until it is firmly set; then untie it.  
And if he feels stiffness after the joint is reduced, and it moves, then bathe it and rub it gently, and press until it is relieved; or apply a greasy lamb's wool to the joint, leave it for a day and a night, then remove it, and let him bathe in a bath.  
And when he sweats, rub the joint gently, then reapply the wool, and then enter the bath; and do this two or three times until it is healed; and if you want, apply warm cow dung mixed with butter, and bind it on; it will return to its proper condition.
