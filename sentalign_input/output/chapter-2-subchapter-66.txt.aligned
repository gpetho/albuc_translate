In this hernia, no one has been seen to be daring enough to treat it with iron.	I have not seen anyone pluck up enough courage to attempt the operative treatment of this kind of rupture.	0.60498905
And the first ones said that it is done as we have described in the hernia with life; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision over it easily; then dry the area around the swelling with something that opens it, until the vessels fall off.	The Ancients indeed said it ought to be done in the same way as hernia with varicocele; namely, to ligate the blood-vessels after cutting down upon them, gently, and lower down. Then make an incision in the middle and apply to the tumour such things as will keep it open until the blood-vessels fall away.	0.6790134
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.	And dress the wound in the manner we have already mentioned until it heals.	0.91623455
