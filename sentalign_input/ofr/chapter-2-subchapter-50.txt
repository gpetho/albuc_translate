of abscesses of the nerves
Just as abscesses occur in the artery and in the vein, abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured, or by excessive work, and similar things.
And this occurs more often in the shoulders and in the fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and it is in several forms without pain;
and when it is pressed firmly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin;
and moves easily in all directions, and goes neither forward nor backward, nor below nor above, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut with iron:
by chance, contraction would occur there;
and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
If the abscess is small, hold it with tweezers/forceps and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, and peel it, then remove it and bring the wound together with stitching, and treat it until it is healed.
