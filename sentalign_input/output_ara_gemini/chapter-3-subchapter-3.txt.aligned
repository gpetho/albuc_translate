Know that nothing breaks from the nose except its upper two sides together or one of them, because they are bones, because the lower part of it is cartilage and does not break.	You should know that the only portion of the nose that can break is the upper portion in its entirety or in one of its two parts; for it consists of two bones.	0.73692286
But rather, it is subject to bruising, bending, and flattening.	The lower portion is cartilaginous and unbreakable; what can happen to it is contusion, twisting, or flattening.	0.44122857
If one of its sides breaks, then you should insert the little finger into the nostril and straighten that fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside until you restore the nose to its natural shape. And let that be done by you gently, and be careful that your action does not cause the patient pain.	If one of the two (upper) parts be broken you should pass your little finger into the nostril and straighten out the fracture from inside, with your index and thumb outside, until you reduce the nose to its natural shape; do it gently, and take care that you do not cause the patient pain in doing it.	0.89089805
If the fracture is in the top of the nose and the finger cannot reach it, then it should be straightened with the tip of a slightly thick probe.	If the fracture be in the upper part of the nose and your finger does not reach it, it should be evened by means of a probe with some thickness to it.	0.92671293
If the fracture is on both sides, then do the same.	If the break be on both sides, follow the same course.	0.79795516
And hasten to set it on the first day of the fracture if possible, otherwise after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling subsides.	Haste must be made to set it on the first day if possible; but if not, after the seventh or tenth day when the effusion has subsided.	0.8467715
Then insert into the nostril a wick of linen scraps if the fracture is on one side, or insert two wicks if the fracture is on both sides. And let the thickness of the wicks be enough to fill the nostril.	Then introduce into the nasal foramen a linen pad, if it be a unilateral fracture, or two pads if it be bilateral; the pads should be thick enough to fill the nasal foramen.	0.883788
Some of the early bone-setters mentioned that the wicks should be moistened with fat and changed every day. But I do not see that. Rather, the wicks should be moistened in egg white mixed with mill dust. Then leave the wicks until the bone is stabilized and the cartilage hardens.	Certain of the ancient bone-setters suggest that you should soak the pads in butter and change them daily, but I do not think so; you should rather soak them in egg-white made up into a paste with mill-dust; then leave the pads in until the bone is firm and the cartilage hardens.	0.883091
You may insert goose feather tubes in the nose in place of the wicks after wrapping soft rags around them. This will make their retention for the nasal fracture stronger and so that the patient is not prevented from breathing.	Sometimes, instead of pads, the stems of goose-quills are introduced into the nose after being wound round with a piece of soft cloth, so as to make a stronger support for the fracture of the nose and not to hinder the patient's breathing.	0.7330572
This is not necessary, if you wish, do it, and if you wish, make the wicks.	This is not absolutely necessary; do it if you prefer; or, if you prefer, put in pads.	0.7940625
If a hot swelling occurs in the nose during your work, then dress the nose with cerate or with cotton dipped in vinegar and rose oil or some of the diachylon ointment.	If during your operation an abscess occurs, apply to the nose a wax plaster or cotton wool soaked in vinegar and oil of roses or a little diachylon ointment.	0.85052073
If a hot swelling does not occur, then you should dress it from the outside with semolina flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white. Then place a soft bandage on it and do not tie the nose with anything at all.	If no abscess occurs you should apply externally a plaster of white flour and frankincense made into a paste with egg-white; then put on top some soft tow, but do not bind up the nose at all.	0.8674832
If the nasal bones are broken into small pieces or shattered, then you should incise over them and remove them with the appropriate instrument. Then sew the incision and treat it with what heals and closes from the appropriate ointments for that.	If the nasal bones are broken into small pieces or crushed, you should cut down upon them, remove them with a suitable instrument, and then suture the incision and dress with suitable ointments which encourage granulation and scarring.	0.8873385
If a wound occurs inside the nose, then you should treat it with wicks and use lead tubes until it heals.	If there occur an internal wound of the nose, you should dress it with pads and employ leaden tubes until it heals.	0.8845303
