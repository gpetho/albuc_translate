Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I completed the book for you, O Sons, which is the last one regarding knowledge in medicine with its supplement, and I have reached the end of it through explanations of the same and the declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise, which is part of surgery, namely, chirurgery with my hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since operation with hand is laid low in our region and at our time entirely deprived of it: perhaps the knowledge of it has perished, and its trace is lost; and only small descriptions of it remain in old books, which have been altered by hands; and error and hesitation occur until the intentions are closed and the force is weakened: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and that I should come with forms of iron tools of Cauterium, and the rest of the instruments of work; when it is done by addition to the declarations and from the necessity of its use.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why a good artisan of it is not found with his hand at this time, is because the art of medicine is long, and the author must be trained in knowledge of anatomy before that, which Galen narrated, until he knows the means of the members, and their shapes, and their union and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, and their number, and their movement, and the pulse vessels, and quiet ones, and their exits; and the locations of their origins.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And for that reason, Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work it is little, and especially in the art of hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 We have already said about him at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Because he who is not knowing what we have said about anatomy, is already in danger of falling into error, in which men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who form themselves from this science and boast about it without knowledge, and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 Because I have seen a foolish surgeon remove an abscess on a woman's neck and cut some arteries in the neck: therefore, blood flowed from the woman until she died in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 And I have seen another surgeon who presumed to extract a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore he came to him, and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And I was already called to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the weakness of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 And I saw another surgeon who was receiving a fee from one of our land's dukes on account of his medicine; and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, that he suffered a fracture near the heel: and the surgeon, in his ignorance, bound up the fracture over an ulcer with plasters and needles, and strong bands, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he closed it according to his negligence.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Afterwards he released him for some days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage; and he stood thus until an abscess formed on his leg, and his foot, and it came to his ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 Therefore I was called to him; and I rushed to unbind the bandage; and calm came upon him, and he was relieved of his pain.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 However, the corruption had already been confirmed in the member; and I could not stop it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Stop the corruption from walking through the limb, until it dies.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous boil; and it became an ulcer until the malignancy of it was exposed with its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 Because when it is a pure cancer from black bile, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron altogether, unless it is in a limb that can endure, so that the whole of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And because of that (the saying) "O Sons," it is necessary for you to know that the operation is divided into two divisions; namely, the operation associated with safety; and the operation, with which there is danger in many situations.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already aroused myself in every place of this book where the operation comes where there is fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore, it is necessary for you to be careful not to divide it and to leave it alone; so that fools do not find a way to speak about it and to dishonor it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Therefore, receive the measure with diligence and protection; and your weak ones with ease and firmness; and use a better way leading by God's grace to salvation and praiseworthy succession; and leave behind difficult diseases; and rid yourselves of that which causes you fear, so that hesitation in faith and comfort may not enter upon you.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your rewards.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 Galenus has already said in some of his warnings.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not treat the evil disease; do not be called an evil doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	 Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 On Cautery with fire and with sharp medicine, this subject is arranged from head to foot, and the forms of instruments and tools for cautery; and all that is necessary for the operation. ¶
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter second.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 On incision and perforation, bloodletting and ventoses, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows and similar things: and the whole chapter, arranged in the forms of instruments. ¶
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter third.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 On restoration, dislocation, treatment of twisting and similar conditions: the chapter arranged from head to foot, and in the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be the glory.

Pars I.	 Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 On the benefit and harm of cautery; in which circumstances it is appropriate, and when to use iron or gold.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 Before I remember the operation with him, it is necessary to say the quality of his remedies and his harms, and in what composition they are displayed.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 Therefore, the discourse on the quality of the Cautery remedy and its harm is lengthy, subtle, scientific, and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Also, a multitude of wise men spoke about it and disagreed on it; for myself, I find their words sufficient, fearing lengthy debate.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 Therefore, I say that the Cautery is applied universally to every composition, whether with matter or without it; except for two compositions, which are the hot composition without matter and the dry composition without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 However, in the hot and dry compositions with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some said that the cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 Others said that the cautery is not suitable for an illness that is caused by heat and dryness; because fire is hot, it is inappropriate to heal from a hot and dry illness with fire and cold.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And the one who says contrary to that said: by means of cautery, a remedy is made for all hot and dry illnesses that occur in human bodies; because when you apply heat to a human body, you find it cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I myself say by his words: because from experience, he has often demonstrated that to me.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 Nevertheless, it is not necessary for him to come on that, unless he has been proven and trained in the chapter of Cauterii exercise at the end, and knows the differences in human compositions, and the dispositions of illnesses within themselves, and their causes and manifestations, and the periods of those illnesses.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 From the remaining temperaments there is no fear for you; and especially concerning cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 For, indeed, all physicians have agreed upon them (the cauteries); and they have not disagreed about the benefit when using cautery on these.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, my children, that through the secret of curing with cautery and fire, as well as its goodness upon the cautery with medicine burning, because fire is simple, whose action does not reach any other part than the one being cauterized; and it harms no other connected member except in a slight degree.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 But the action of burning medicine reaches that which is extended from members; and perhaps it causes difficulty in healing the member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 Fire, however, because of its subtlety and goodness, does not do this unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 But we have come to know this through experience, because of the length of service and study with art, and because of its steadfastness on truth; and therefore I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not forbidden to this book of mine, I would tell you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies in expelling diseases, which was demonstrated by the philosophical discourse, which would sharpen your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, my children, that they themselves disagree concerning the time when cautery is to be made, and place better the time with truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that cautery is fitting at all times; therefore, any harm resulting from time is submerged in the benefit which attracts it when cautery is applied.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if cautery is for pains from necessary strong, speedy pains which cannot tolerate delay; therefore it is feared that a greater evil may occur than slight harm caused by time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And let not that thought occur to your minds, my sons, that they do not consider, except for the common people and foolish physicians, that there is no return always in the ailment which is cured by cautery; and they place this as a consequence, but matters are not thus as they think: therefore because cauterization is not, except in place of medicine, which changes complexion, and expels humidities which are the causes, wherefore pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 Nevertheless, cauterization is superfluous over medicine due to the swiftness of its health, and the power of its operation, and the violence of its dominion; and it is possible that the ailment returns at some hour of time according to the complexion of the sick, and the location of his ailment, and the strength of it; and what has been prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluidities in him; and what reaches him in acquisition from foods and similar things due to causes, unless there is an ailment where cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle ailment in a member of few superfluidities and humidities, such as cauterization of the tooth, due to pain, and similar things, it is possible that that pain will not return in him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 But this happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 Indeed, the speech of the common people again, that cauterization is the last medicine, is a correct statement; not regarding what they intend in it; for they believe that there is no cure which confers with medicine, nor with anything after the disappearance of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 But the matter is opposite to that which they intend regarding that cauterization is the last medicine; it is not so unless when we administer methods of cure for some ailment, and those do not confer with the medicine; then at the end of the matter we apply cauterization, and it confers; hence arises the notion that cauterization is the last medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this unless on account of the equality of gold and its nobility; and they said that it does not produce pus at the site of the cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 That is not absolutely true; for I have already proven it, and I found that this does not happen in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And cautery with it (gold) is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 Nevertheless, when you put fire to the cautery from gold in fire, it is not made clear to you at what degree of heat it burns according to your will, because of the redness of gold; and when it approaches towards it (the gold), cold comes forth, and if you add more heating, it melts in the fire, and it turns into leaves.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore, the craftsman falls into a fixation with it (gold); and for that reason, we use cautery with iron more quickly and closer at hand, because of its straightness in operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And I myself have already arranged this Chapter on Cautery, according to chapters; and I have arranged it from head to foot, so that the seeker may find what he wants in it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 § On the Method of Cauterizing a Head at the Coronal Suture.
Caput II.	 Chapter II:
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 Here, the cauterization is applied for the mastery over humidity and coldness on the brain: which are two causes of soda (seizures), and of the abundance of fluid flow from the head to the parts of eyes and ears, and the abundance of sleep, and tooth pain, and throat pain: and universally every sickness that happens due to coldness, such as paralysis, sodae (a specific condition), epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar conditions due to sicknesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is to instruct the sick person: that it should be evacuated first with a solution of medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to the strength and age of the sick person and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then command him (the sick person) to scrape his head with a potsherd.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then make him sit facing you, so that he has placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that place with an unburnt (charred) spot.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then burn the cautery in oil: this is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then place it (the cautery) on the marked and unburnt spot, while you press it gently with your hand and turn it around.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that the quantity of skull or the quantity of pus is exposed, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, press your hand with the iron itself, or with another tool if it becomes cold: until the bones I told you appear.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take something from salt, dissolve it in water, and immerse the cloth in it, and place it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place upon him a cloth soaked in butter, and let it remain over the place until the eschar (scab or dry crust) is consumed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with the ointment called tetrapharmacon, until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 As they say, the more an open wound remains, the more it discharges pus; therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 And some of them say that the skin should be cauterized to the bone; and hold the cautery until something of the thickness of the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then file away the burnt part from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 And others say that when you reach the bone with the cautery, an impression should be made in it as deep as a nail head, so that the bone falls out, forming a cavity like a cork: or an instrument that women use filled with the small alphabet (poultice): and they think that the vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and leave the open wound for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then treat it until it solidifies.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 For me, these two types of cautery do not seem to be suitable for anyone except in certain men, according to the way of fear (fearful people).
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And leave it alone, in my opinion, it is better with his own health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 For the head weakens from the resolution of its own continuity (natural state), as we have witnessed in other members: and especially when the head of a sick person is naturally weak: and the first species of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it; therefore, operate with it for safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the head when there is pain in the whole head.
Caput III.	 Head (chapter).
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When there is a chronic pain throughout the head, and it persists in a weak person and uses heat-producing agents (herbs, hot baths, etc.), massaging the head, applying oils and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And particularly if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, as I have said, and nothing is added to it from those [others]: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If the head of the sick person is strong by nature and not weak, and finds violent coldness: then cauterize it with another cautery slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize it over all the horn of its head with another cautery, so that the skin is not penetrated, and a quantity of bone, as I have said, is exposed.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And cauterize it with one cautery on the back of its head, in a place called "the vase", and it is the place where the vent is placed; and lift your cloth (matum) in this and do not expose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For the sick one finds intense pain because of that pain, and different from the pain of all other cauteries on the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I will say that this Cautery is in its place: and it must be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of its head more subtlely with a cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in hemicrania, both with hot medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When pain and swelling occur in a part of the head or extends to the eye, and the head is weakened with purifying medicines, and further treatment, as I have said in the divisions of diseases, does not help: then cauterization in this case is done according to two methods: either cauterization with hot medicine burning, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The cautery with hot medicine burning is, that you take one tooth from an allium (onion or garlic), and grind it up, and cut off the ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then cut the painful spot in time with a broad lancet, until there is a place under the skin where the tooth can be captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Insert it there under the skin until it is hidden; then bind it above with a suitable plaster and leave it for fifteen hours, then dissolve it, and extract the onion, and leave it untouched for two or three days: afterwards place a warm compress over it submerged in butter, until the spot makes pus; then care for it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to do this with certain burning medications, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on the Meidicines that Burn.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 However, cauterization of it with iron is as follows.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 The form of the fire cautery is as follows.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 And it is called "Clavilis" because the shape of its head is like that of a nail, in which there is some hardness, and in the middle of it there is a small projection.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the spot and hold your hand; and you rotate the iron slowly with speed: and let the quantity to be burnt be of the thickness of the skin, as its half.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And raise your hand so that not the artery below is burned and let blood flow out.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then immerse the compress in water and salt, place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then put the compress with butter; afterwards care for it with an ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, cauterize this hemicania with the tip of a second-degree cautery knife.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 Avoid cutting the artery in this hemicania, not an old one specifically.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 § On the method of cauterizing in an old hemicania.
Caput V.	 Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you treat a hemicrania, with what we said in the preceding cure, and what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help: and if you see from the illness that what we said about the first cauterization with medicine or with cauterization with fire is insufficient, then it is necessary to heat the cauterium with iron until it turns white after marking the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger or similar: and place one hand in its place, and press it until you cut through the artery, and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary that you avoid burning the jaw which moves during chewing, so as not to burn the side or nerve which moves it, from where a spasm may occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And be careful of the guard and caution for the flow of blood from the artery that was cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 For there is fear in its cutting and especially for him who does not know what he is doing or is not diligent, experienced: and he should first abandon the operation.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I shall come with a reminder of the management of blood flowing from the cut artery according to its own manner, and at the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you see from the illness that this cauterization is insufficient and you see the body of the weak person bearing the cauterization in the middle of the head as we have narrated, then treat a wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you wish, administer the cauterization as we have said in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cauterizer having two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 For this cauterization is better and more helpful.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in pain of the ear.
Caput VI.	 Head VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When cold pain occurs in the ear and it is treated with solutions, and the rest of the treatment as we said in division, and yet the pain does not subside, then cautery by fire: and this is called a puncture, whose shape is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then, after the cautery, make a puncture around the entire ear as it revolves; or around both if pain is on both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And extend yourself slightly with the cautery from the root of the ear afterwards, after marking the places with pitch; and let the size of the cautery be ten punctures in every ear, and so on.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then treat the areas until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 Section on the method of cauterization in strangulation.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 Strangulation, which is treated with cauterization, is not anything but those which occur due to phlegm, as we said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And avoid cauterization for species that occur due to exhaustion and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When you treat this type of strangulation with hyssop, purges and gargarisms, and your treatment does not improve, then it is necessary to cauterize the weak one with three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear, second slightly lower than its opening, and third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And place your cautery from the weaker side.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the form of the cauterization is that you should cauterize yourself with the cautery directly on the extremity of the upper part of the ear under the horn of the head slightly; and another one in the opening: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And place your hand with the cautery until the thickness of half the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of the Cautery, and it is a type from a knife, whose shape is as follows: nevertheless, it should not be too fine, as you see; and it is necessary that the knife in it should have little excess thickness.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then care for the places, until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 Chapter on the ancient method of cauterization in Apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When the apoplexy becomes ancient and the care of it, as we said earlier, does not help, and the patient is not feverish, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as mentioned before, and a cautery on the occiput of the head, according to what was stated; and the method of cauterization should be as stated previously.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Also cauterize with a Cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and this is more final.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then it should be taken care of when the previous procedure has been completed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in Oblivion.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 It is necessary that in drink there be first of all the juice of large onions, and pills cleansing the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then shave completely the head of the sick person and place upon his occiput an ointment made from henna described in the treatise on ointments, and place it often.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 For this is the method of cautery; make that same one according to the order I mentioned there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If therefore he is healed by it, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not: then make for him three cauteries on the back of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye, and place between each cautery a thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then care for the cautery with it (the same as before).
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If however you wish an addition and the sick person can bear it: then make a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 What if you wish an addition: then cauterize him over two horns (of the skull).
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then care for it until he is healed; let the cautery be anointed according to the shape that was mentioned before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	 On the method of cauterization in paralysis and softening (of a hardened mass).

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 Then shave the sick person's head; then cauterize it with a mid-head cautery, and with a cautery on every horn of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of his neck, and with three cauteries on the spine.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If you need softening of the body by more of these (cauteries), and the sick person can bear it and the ailment is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries on the spine, and the last one with cautery until it burns most from his skin, and take care to spare the hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then care for himself until he is healed: and thus cauterize with oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 On the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 A epileptic is not cauterized, unless his epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore it is necessary that you first clean the brain of the patient with hyson, and with the rest of the treatment that we have said in the division: when the sick person is serious, or is tolerant in receiving medications.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 If however the patient is a child who does not tolerate medications, then administer gargarisma and cleansing chews that clean the brain, before that for many days with good nourishment.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with a single cautery in the middle of the head as was previously mentioned, and also with another cautery at the back of his head, and over all the horn of his head with cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 If the sick person is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with cauteries as was said in the case of paralysis, and with softening of the body over vertebrae at the neck and vertebrae at the back: and let the cautery be oiled according to the method that has previously been mentioned.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	 If however the sick person is a child, then place a subtle cautery according to this method.

Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	 When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with Cauteries, as we have said in the one having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of declivity towards melancholy, and there is a weak body wet, then give him in drink what purifies his brain, according to what has preceded in division: then shave the head of the sick one, and make afterwards a correctly made plaster (tortellum) from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it in the middle of the head: and the sick one sitting square should be held from all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Then present the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 And it is more suitable from ancient sheep butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	 And heat it over fire with a moderate temperature measurement, which the finger can tolerate when it is introduced into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	 Then evacuate it in the middle of his head in a circle, and let it out until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	 Do this to the sick one once a week with the rest of his good regimen, until he is cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	 Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures in it, besides which hold the hand with the cautery: let it be smelling.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	 For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with its nature.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	 Then put a damp cloth soaked in butter or goose fat on it.

When you are informed of the beginning of water flowing into the eye through signs that I have said in the division, then begin and give drink to the sick one, with what purifies his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And keep him away from all humidity, and make him sit in a bath for several days in fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then command him to shave his head and to cauterize it in the middle of his own head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then cauterize it on both temples with two cauteries, if there is no descent of water in both eyes at once; or from one side, if there is no watery discharge in one eye; and cut off all veins and arteries that are under the skin with the cautery; and let the cauteries be long in width equal to the temples; and avoid bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 If you see something from it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of veins, and the cutting off of them, and precaution against bleeding.

When the tears of the eyes are chronic and continuous, and are above the veins and arteries that are manifest on the outside of the head, it is verified that this is due to an excess of cold, phlegmatic humors; then cauterize with the same cautery as I described in the treatment of watery discharge, cauterize in the middle of the head with a single cautery, and on both temples with two cauteries, and on the neck under two bones with two cauteries.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if it requires additional treatment, then cauterize it on every side of the eye carefully with a small cautery at the end of the eyebrow.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows with two cauteries in all places; and let them extend from both temples; and let the length of all the cautery be according to the length of the eyebrows; and do not place your hand with the cautery at its end, rather according to the amount that the third eyelid is burned.

Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 The cautery is in it according to two modes: either the cautery with fire; or the cautery with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 In the cautery with fire, command the patient to release his hairs if they are from those who clean them, until they extend and match.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If they prick him at the place of its emergence: then bind his eyes with ointment so that they do not move until it is born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When they are born and match, then place the head of the patient in your bosom: then mark on the eyelids of his eyes with encaustum (hot wax), marking it in the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then place a cotton soaked in egg white or slippery elm bark decoction over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then heat the cautery, whose form is as follows:
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize gradually in several places on the skin whose surface has the shape of the myrtle leaf, appearing completely.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And your mark of health for the operation is that if you see the eyelids contract and hairs raised at the prick on the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 So lift up your hand then: and dismiss him for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then place cotton with butter over him until the eschar is healed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If any hair returns after an hour and softens the eyelid, then repeat the cautery on that place as you did before.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If the hairs are in the lower part: then cauterize it until the hair grows back to its own natural place and matches so that it does not prick the eye.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 Inform the patient to shave, until they grow long and are even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make from cloth a shape like a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take from known soap and un-soaked lime, one ounce of each, or approximately the same amount; then grind them together with good friction, and do it quickly so that it does not become cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then place it on the cloth that you have prepared in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and put it on the eyelid of one or both eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And place raw egg yolk that has been soaked under the eye, and let the head of the sick person be on your chest.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 Place your index finger on the medicine and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 And you move it as often as the sick person feels the bite of the medicine, for its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 And when this bite that he feels persists, then release the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When the bite ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 And then observe whether the eyelid swells as it does when heated by fire or cut; if so, it is good: and if not, apply more medicine to the place where the medicine does not press and does not darken, until your operation is complete and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then put raw egg yolk with butter on it until the burnt skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with diaphinicon ointment or another, until he is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 It is necessary for you to keep the final precaution during the operation, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid becomes soft after days and some matter falls into the eye from the hairs, then apply more medicine to that place which has become soft from the eyelid, just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for himself until he recovers.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 This is the form of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that human eyes vary in size and shape.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore, according to this, your consideration should be: and the path of righteousness for him who is devoted to this art should not be hidden.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 Section on the method of cauterizing in lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When you treat a Fistula, and your treatment does not improve as we said regarding the division of diseases: then, it is necessary that you cauterize it in this manner.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Command the sick person to place his head in your lap, and let one of his servants hold his head like this, so that it is not moved or shaken with his own head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then place warm oil soaked cotton or slippery elm on his eye, then apply the hot cautery of this form.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 Let it be concave like the shape of a vulture's feather quill from one end, and make the cautery in this manner: if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to extend upwards in this way.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then open the fistula if it is open and drain the pus from it, and cut out the fistula; and if it is not open, then open it and drain its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place the cautery on it, which has been heated very hot.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand near the cautery from the eye to the nose, so that your hand does not stray or shake the sick person; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If you reach the beginning of your cautery to the bone, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, as needed; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place warm oil with butter on it, and treat it with an ointment for healing, until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 If it has passed forty days and is not healed: then place a sharp corrosive medicine on it until the bone appears; and scrape it as it comes in its chapter (layer).
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And there is another method of cautery for a fistula, which some early ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Direct yourself to the location of the fistula, and find it; then place a thin cannula therein: namely, a thin cannula with this shape.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 Pour a quantity of drachmas worth of molten lead into it, and hold your hand with good retention by the cannula, and let not the weak one be moved at all, so that the molten lead does not run or reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 It is necessary that you place a hot cloth over the weak one's closed eye in egg white or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns the location of the fistula and heals it by a marvelous cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula is healed together with what we said from cautery, and cure, that is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 If not, then it is necessary to make an opening in the nose and lead the fistula back to the course of the nose, as it comes to its own proper place.

Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 When you treat these splits, as we have said in the division of diseases, and the cure does not help, then use a small cautery with a scalpel, according to this shape.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let the concavity of it be according to the subtlety of the scalpel.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place it heated quickly into these splits, until the cautery reaches the depth of the splits.

Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 When a boil occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus and bursts; afterwards it becomes old, and pus runs, and it turns into a fistula: then treat it, and the cure does not help, then it is necessary to burn cautery according to its size, which can enter the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then insert it heated into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand, until the iron heated reaches the bottom of it and its end: do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then take care of it afterwards, with what we have said about the treatment, until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If the pus is cut off and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the rotten bone according to what comes at its head.

Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 When the gum softens due to dampness and the teeth move, and it is treated with medicine but does not help; then place the head of the sick person in your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then place the cautery tool, whose shape will come later, on top of the tooth, and insert in it a heated cauterium quickly. Hold your hand briefly until the weak feeling of fire heat reaching the root of the tooth is felt.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 Lift the cautery tool. Then repeat the cauterization several times, as desired.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Then fill the weakened mouth with water and salt, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 For a tooth which moves, its firmness is strengthened, the gums are softened, and corruption of moisture is dried up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 [Paragraph] On the method of cauterizing teeth in pain.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When the pain of a tooth is due to coldness or there is coldness within it, or worms, and treatment with medicines does not help: then use the cauterization in two ways: either the cauterization with butter; or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The cauterization with butter is as follows: take cow's butter and boil it in an iron cauldron or earthenware.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take the cup and turn it over on top of the stitched edge.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then immerse it [the cup] in boiled butter: and place it on the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools: then repeat it several times, until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if you wish, immerse wool or a cup in cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth: and place hot iron on top of it until the heat reaches the depth of the tooth's hollow.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 However, cauterization with fire is to shape a brass or iron cannula.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 And let there be something of substance within his body so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the weak bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then with the cautery, let its shape come: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either on the same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 And it is necessary that the weak bone be filled with good butter during the impression of the cautery and hold it for an hour: then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Cauterize with whatever end you wish, according to what is possible: and this is the form of the cannula.

When blisters are caused by phlegm and cold humors, and they do not respond to digestion with medicines, and you wish a quick digestion: then with the hollow cautery shaped like this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open ends so that the smoke can escape from one end of the cautery: and place it hot on top of the boil once, and twice if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the boil.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the ulcer is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then let it be for three days, and put on top of it a hot pot filled with butter, until what burned by fire is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 Afterwards, care for it with tooth ointment, until the form of the channel heals.

When moistures conquer over the canal of the lung, especially when this is with coldness of constitution, then it is necessary that the sick one should be evacuated firstly with soluble medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 Then cauterize it (the lesion) at the notch of the throat near the root: and take care that the cautery does not reach the throat, nor the skin, unless something of it (the cautery).
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 Then cauterize it (the lesion) with another cautery at the junction of the neck near the last vertebrae: and let the cautery be a nail, according to the method that preceded.

When cough and lung illness are from cold moistures, and the sick person does not have fever, nor consumption, and the illness is old: then cauterize it (the lesion) with two cauteries above the collarbone in hollow, open places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be a tube according to the form that preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 And if your method of cauterization is by pricking with a cautery called Punctum, whose form was previously mentioned in the treatment of ear pain: and let the pricks be from thirty pricks up to others (similar).
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it (the lesion) with what was previously used, until it is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 Why is cauterization avoided when you do it with only one cautery instead of three?

Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 When the head is dislocated due to causes of humidity and it does not return on its own by the hour following the dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to the return, then it should be dislocated slightly, as has been already testified, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the sick person lies down on his back or on the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then the skin that is inside the cheek towards the upper part is to be peeled off with your left hand fingers, and if the dislocation is towards the inner parts.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 Then taking two-pronged cautionery by fire.

Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side and a figure of four cauteries appears.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And sometimes cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, for which the figure of cauterization becomes that of six cauteries; and there are prongs according to the subtlety of the test.

When cold and many humidity occur in the stomach until it separates from its composition, catarrh multiplies towards it and continuous methods of treatment do not help; then it is necessary that the sick person lies down on his back, extends his legs, and his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery under the size of a cowry shell of the breast, one cautery like a nail, and two cauteries below from the sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And extend between both so that they do not join together, when it causes pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the cautery be the thickness of two thirds of the skin.

When there is pain in the liver due to coldness and dampness, or from large flatulence, until it exits from its natural exit of superfluous matter and the sick person recovers with what we have said and does not improve in that: then it is necessary that the sick person lies down on his neck, and marks with encaustrum three cauteries according to this shape, and the same size below Epar where the arm length reaches: and let the space between every cautery be the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body straight: and do not press your hand much with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the size of what is burned be according to the thickness of the skin, without addition: and let the sick person stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If it is not standing, then let it lie, which already extends its legs, and raises its arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the form of cauterization.

When it happens that there is a discharge, and you want to know if the abscess is in the flesh of the liver or its membrane: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, there comes a mild pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the membrane of the liver, with intense pain there is a severe sharpness; and you see now that the treatment of this person has exhausted the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore the sick man should lie on his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then shape the place of the abscess with a brazier; then light the cautery that resembles a rod.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And cauterize it with a single cautery until the skin is burned entirely and reaches the membrane, until all pus comes out; then treat the person by means of treatment for discharges, until he is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And it is not necessary to use this cauterization method, unless the zeal for the study of medicine prolongs one's life; and when these illnesses converge in one person with experience on occasion: then let him dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 But rather to abandon it, is better in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Head, Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said, cautery with the roots of Aristolochia for cold pleurisy according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is, that you receive from the dry roots of Aristolochia (long ones), one longer root which is found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil, and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize with one cautionery where it is between the neck of the collarbone and the neck, and with two small cauteries below in the hollow areas near the area that is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two small cauteries also where it is between the fifth and sixth ribs on the sides a little towards the back, and with one cautionery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three small cauteries from the back: one where it is between the scapulas (shoulder blades), and two from the sides of the chest, below, one where it is between the scapulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And you should not press your hand with the cautionery, rather it should be in open air to smell the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And some of the ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a ray (probably a reference to a tool called radium), and heat it, and put it inside where it is between the ribs until they reach the abscess with it, and the pus comes out; as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this perforation with cautery, there is fear that either the sick person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs at the site, which does not heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the spleen, XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you treat the illness of the spleen, as we have said in the treatment of diseases, and your treatment does not help, then there is a need for cautery on it according to three methods, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One (method) is to make three or four cauteries, by drawing them along the length of the spleen according to the shape of Epatis' cauterizations, whose preceding figure it is.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let each cautery be of thickness equal to that of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 Let the method of cauterizing, which we mentioned in the cauterization of the liver, be done equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press your hand with the cautery; let the patient be weak and lying on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method of cauterization is: holding the cautery with two openings, as we said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and peel off the skin that is directly over the spleen, where the elbow of the weak left arm comes to; and your peeling should be in the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert two openings with very hot fire until it penetrates the skin from the other side; then remove the cautery; thus there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you wish to cauterize using a cautery with three openings.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then take care of the cautery after you release it, let it discharge pus for many days; for it is more effective than the rest that preceded in treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 The cautery does not fall in dropsy unless it is properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you treat a dropsy with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries around the navel, one on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, two behind the vertebrae, and one on the breastbone, and another on the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be nearly equal to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then let the open cautery emit pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not evacuate the weak patient from treatment after cauterization with it: this should be done so that two intentions are gathered to him: and healing will hasten towards it with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the cautery used to cauterize the abdomen should be a claw, according to its previous form; and the one with which the back is cauterized should be an oil jar, according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When they suffer from hydrops and are filled with citrus water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the nail area, which is between the earlobe and ankle; and hold the cautery with one hand and do not twist it; then remove your hand; and do not return to it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 Citrus water will boil and the cautery should be of this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two cauteries for each leg, and let the cautery be with the tip of a scalpel-shaped cautery; and let the cautery be along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below it, about halfway down the leg; and over the entire hip joint, place two cauteries; and leave the open cautery without treatment for a long time, so that some liquid boils out of it; then treat it as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in the resolution of the abdomen.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the abdomen is dissolved by cold and humidity until the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines weaken; and it is treated with methods of treatment but does not heal; and you see a weak person tolerating an excessively hot cautery, then cauterize it with a large cautery over its own stomach, according to the previous method of cauterizing the stomach with a ring-shaped cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a thin claw-shaped cautery; and with a large cautery over the alcatin above the hips or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture and the weak enduring it, then cauterize him with a cautery on his head and with a cautery over all of his back; and perhaps you will add two small cauteries near the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 The treatment is progressing, whose benefit does not stray.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 [Title] On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are thick, cold, or corrupted by excessive moisture, and they are treated as we have said in the division, but the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower part of the back of the pelvis below the almuecate, triangularly, and with a cautery beneath the navel about two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you think that his stomach is cold and food is not digested in him, and you see that his face is discolored, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery as before; and with a cautery on his liver and another on his spleen, with a cautery at the clavicle; and leave the open cautery for some time; then care for him until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 [Title] On the method of cauterizing an ulcer after its removal.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you amputate a toe (or digit), then heat the cautery similar to a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then insert the heated (hot) instrument into the amputated toe (digit); and hold your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If there are many toes (digits) to be amputated, then cauterize each one with the cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with the substance that you apply to them until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on the boil, it is more beneficial for healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the sick person does not obey the cutting and operation that we have described in its place, and is afraid of it, perhaps he will heal with cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 If an anal fistula arises and becomes inflamed, pus flows from it, and the surrounding tissues become corrupted (rotten).
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Therefore, as is fitting, it should be examined with a probe of fine thread.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then, recognize the depth of it with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then heat the cautery which is similar to a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then insert the heated instrument into the fistula up to the depth of the probe (clamp).
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeatedly cauterize over it until all the corrupted tissues are burned away, once, twice, or three times, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And be careful not to burn the nerve or large vein if it is there; or if the fistula leads to the bladder or the intestine, then be cautious in these areas.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 Do not do this unless when the fistula is in a fleshy area; and reflect that it does not penetrate (pass through).
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If (the wound) is sealed and the matter within it is removed, and it remains in this state for a long time, then you will know that it has healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 If the matter is not removed from it, then you will know that it is penetrating, or that the bone within it is rotten, or as if from one of those (things) whose memory comes to mind in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or gross wind, and it weakens the body because of that, then it is necessary to cauterize it on top of the almethenem over both kidneys, with a cautery over the entire kidney with a claw-like cautery, whose precedent has been remembered.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 Perhaps we should cauterize it again in the same almeidatum.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Therefore, three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Hence they will be more beneficial at the end.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 Chapter on the mode of cauterizing the Bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL:
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness and softening occur in the Bladder due to coldness and moisture, so that the sick person cannot retain urine, then cauterize it at its lower part on the anus above the Bladder, where the pubic hairs begin, and cauterize from the right anus, and another one from the left of it: and let the length of this cauterization be according to the size of a thumb knuckle: and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or two cauteries, if necessary: and let it be as deep as the previous cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 When weakness and softening occur in the Womb due to coldness and moisture, so that the sick person cannot retain seed, then cauterize
Caput XLI.	 On Cauterizing the Uterus. In this Chapter,
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When coldness and moisture occur in the Uterus, and it is prevented from conception, and its menstruation is corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs near the time of their arrival, then it is necessary to be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the Bladder, and a cautery below the navel on the back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be deep.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 On Cauterizing the Anus in Dislocation. In this Chapter,
Caput XLII.	 When the anus is displaced from its place, then it should be reduced
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 and when the secretions of the mucous membrane flow towards the anus, and this causes its expulsion from its place, there is a sign that this has happened because the leg is prolonged above the other when they are put together: and a hollow is found in this displacement.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the sick person over the anus of this with a similar cautery in a circle around the anus: after you mark it with enkaustre around the anus, as it has been described: and let the anus fall into the center of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let the cautery be of the shape that precedes in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, together with a large oily cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin in total.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 On the method of cauterization for Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in the ankle joint and its cause is coldness and moistness: and the sick person is treated as we said in division, but the treatment does not help, and it deteriorates: then it is necessary that you release the sick person from thick humors with fetid pills or with artificial pills and similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of cauterization is done in two ways: either with cautery using medicaments or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 Cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, est sic faciendum: Preparatur vas calidum et purgatur ab humore. Et in e
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One method is to cauterize on the joint of the ankle with three triangular cauteries in this manner:
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make it a good or bad depth for them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And let the space be which is between every cautery of this size, that of a finger's thickness: and let the cautery be oil-soaked.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Sometimes the cautery is done in the middle on top of the ankle joint itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 If you wish to cauterize with a circle that precedes the form of the ankle joint dislocation, it should be one: so that the circle contains the ankle joint completely.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And burn the thickness of the skin all around.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is the method of cauterization for sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the ankle itself and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, at the place where the sick person indicates, where the pain is, and with your cautery four fingers towards the outer part: and let the cautery be sharp-pointed.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the sick person indicates that the pain extends up to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates, with a cautery of points, three, or four, or more, if necessary.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 And if he indicates that the pain is turned towards the leg from the knee, then cauterize it there with a single knife-cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And beware of yourself in all your cauterizations, so that you do not burn the nerve or great artery with the cautery, and attract harm or contraction upon the sick person through it.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 And I myself have already seen one and another who cauterized above the heel and exceeded in their cauterization, and the leg became swollen until the tumor reached the foot, and it was perforated all over, and the entire foot was rotten; then there followed a rupture of the abdomen, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And some wise men have said about cauterizing the anus, that this is the method of the cautery.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a brazier similar to a thimble, whose diameter is half the width of the palm; and it should be placed at the opening according to its size, namely the thickness of the tip of a finger or less; and inside this brazier should be another smaller brazier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And let the space between all the braziers be the size of a grape; and let the braziers have openings on two sides; and let their height be like that of a knuckle, or two knuckles; and make handles for them from iron suitably attached to the braziers.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it is heated in the fire until it glows and sparks; then it should be placed on a brazier near the sick anus, who lies on his healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Cauterize him therefore with three round caustics at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then release him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Afterwards pack it with butter; and leave the open wound for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with an ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Says Albucasis to his sons, we have too little used the method of cauterization with this appearance, due to fear of its aspect; and therefore, because few are found who await him.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 Nevertheless, it is one of the good caustics for him that endures it, and finds a place for it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 However, cautery with acting medicines is to be done thus by you: take two samia having a perforated armillary, into which descends the pin of his door from bronze or iron, the length of the wall; whose height should be two knots, or as if themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let the space that is between the two be of the size of the thickness of a finger, and be open below and above; and let it hold each other in place according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then lay it on a pot-ash anchor, with the weak one lying upon the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand very much upon the pot-ash anchor.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour between two circles of warm water, which is heated a little with fire and hold it for the length of an hour; and let the weak one endure the biting of it, and his burning, for he finds the biting as fire, until the biting stops.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then wash your hand with an instrument, and remove warm water from the entire pot-ash anchor with sweet water; then release it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And place butter over it until the blackness of burning is removed; and release it for some days, and let pus run out from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 It is indeed the final help [remedy] [in a medical treatment].
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain spreads to the hip or leg: make a socket in it that contains water, as you did equally in the ankle.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of drugs.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take equal parts of alkali and unburnt lime, grind each one separately, put them in a new pot whose lower part is perforated by a small hole, according to the quantity that will enter [the pot], namely the radius: put another unglazed pot beneath it: pour over the alkali and lime from sweet water, so that each submerges to the depth of a finger: after you have compressed them with your hand, let it stand until the sharp water comes out through the lower part of the unglazed pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then mix that water with another lime: and boil it until it returns.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 It will then be indeed very strong against sharpness, which is used in many medical procedures and in the cauterization of other parts [of the body].
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Since it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And from the drugs used in the cauterization of ankles, such as tetisie, honey from the nutmeg tree, lime with soap, so that each is mixed together. (The rest of the sentence is incomplete and cannot be translated accurately without additional context.)
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galenus himself, in his narrative, reported a cure for the pain of an ankle and sciatic vein, which he highly praised [as very effective].
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that it did not require any other cure, and that it was cured with just one application, as long as [the patient] himself probably entered a bath, and came out healthy from there.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is to be taken from green seitaragia: and if it is not found as green, take dry and recent one; and grind much with some fat, and place on the sore, whether it is on the leg or in the hip: and tie it, and leave for a quantity of three hours, or until it feels a weak sensation of heating.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then insert it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When its body becomes warm, insert it into the sun.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For pain recedes, and it heals.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that no one should use cautery with these medications unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides who said that goat dung, when it is burned with sciatic vein, gives it: and the cautery is made according to this method.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep place that is between the toe of the foot and the heel, and closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry goat dung, ignite it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	 Then repeat that procedure.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Do not stop doing that until the sensation reaches the sore and the pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cautery is called "cauterium Vaccinum".
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 [Section heading] On the cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Sometimes pain occurs in the back due to many causes, either from a fall, strike, excessive evacuation, or similar things, due to the influx of cold and moist matter. And cautionery does not apply except in this single case, which is made by the influx of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after the evacuation of the sick person with fetid pills and similar ones, three lines should be made on the back where there is pain, according to the width of the palm itself, after marking them with encaustic in every line with five cauteries or more according to the amount that comes from the strength of the sick person. And the cauterization should be done with cauteriopuncti.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries along with a median claw-shaped cautery in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in hump-like growths.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This illness often occurs in small children many times.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 And the sign of its incipient growth in children is that it occurs upon them during stridor at elevation, and movement: and you find at the bottom of the spine and the nodes of this that it has begun to protrude above the other spines.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 When you see that and wish to make it, then cauterize it with a round-shaped cautery in this manner.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And take the cautery over the entire spine equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the spine with a puncture-shaped cautery, make two lines or three; and let the punctures be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then take care of the place until it heals as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And beware not to administer cautionery in a hump-like growth that is caused by a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 On the method of cauterizing in gout, and the pains of joints.
Caput XLVI.	 De modo cauterizandi in podagra et doloribus artic
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the pains of joints are due to cold and moist humors which flow into any part of the body, then when such pains occur in the feet, it is proper for physicians to call it gout (Podagra).
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 Since gout caused by cold is treated with various methods of treatment and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is that one should cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the foot, with many cauteries; and let the cautery be Oilburner.
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you need to puncture the sole of the foot, then do it with a cautery point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pains rise up to the knees or other joints and it frequently happens so, then cauterize it over the whole knee with three or four cauteries from all sides, using this same cautery called Clauile.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If more than one cautery is required for you, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about as thick as the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If the pains rise up to the knees and the back, then administer what was said in the chapter on it.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If the pains are only in the hands, then puncture around the knuckles, as if two lines were turned over.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If pain remains only in the fingers, then puncture them all, on every knuckle and on the back of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If the pains rise up after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not evacuate the weak from good management, from receiving medications.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 If good care is taken and phlegm is evacuated, it will be cured with God's help by means of this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 On the method of cauterization for ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter Forty-Seven.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When a rupture occurs in the groins and the intestine or the scrotum descends, and it is beginning nearby: then one should order the patient to abstain from food on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And let him use laxatives, so that he may expel feces from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then let him sit on his back before you; and order him to hold his breath until the scrotum appears or the intestine does.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then reduce him with your fingers and mark the place of rupture on his chest with hot wax, using a sign whose end is similar to the diameter of half a circle above his body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then heat the cautery of this shape until it becomes white and throw pieces of hot iron on it.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then return the intestine or scrotum to its hollow.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then let the servant place his hand on the place, so that the intestine does not come out; and you have already opened between the legs of the patient, and you placed a stone under him, and another servant is on his thighs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the cautery on the mark, with your hand holding the cautery upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold him until you meet the bone with it; or use another place if you are not able to meet the bone with it until the bone.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And carefully observe the exit of the intestine at the hour of your cautery, so that you do not burn him and it comes over him, or he dies from it or suffers great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not meet the bone with the cautery, your operation is of no avail.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 And it must be a small, delicate cautery for children, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat with the remaining ointments until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 The patient lies down for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 It is necessary that you place the nourishment for him according to the length of his treatment time, so as to soften his stomach; lest his intestines go out during attempts at evacuation and famine.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a well-made bandage and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 Let him be lessened in labor, and fullness of food and drink, and violent voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 For when he uses this regime, thus is he cured with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I will say the cure for hernias with an incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 When hernias occur in the rest of the abdomen and are beginning and they fear that they will increase, then cauterize the hernia with a round cautery according to its size; and let it be what is burned from that point on as one third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then care for him as I have said; do not add to it.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And some of the first ones have said that the hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is signed with pitch and a line is placed that is across its width on the upper side of the hernia, and another line downwards.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with the awl (clavius).
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing for pain due to a blow or impact.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When pain occurs in some limbs due to a blow or impact; and the pain persists for a long time and there is no help with medications, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the puncture cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And let the cautery be for every member, according to its size and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and its location of twisting, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If he is cured by the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then repeat the cautery upon him.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because it is customary for these pains to change from one member to another that is near it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore, you must follow them with the cautery until the sick man is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 Chapter on the mode of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 The leprous, however, are sometimes helped greatly by the cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And particularly the species of leprosy which is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: when you consider the need to cauterize it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If the leprosy is incipient and you have treated it as we said in the division, and it does not decrease nor cease: beware of the sick man, lest corruption spread over his entire complexion: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, known, and the second below it facing the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind it over the nuchal bone of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And lay your hand with the cautery a little longer, until it makes an impression smaller than the palm in the bone, and the cortices will be displaced: so that the expiration of gross vapors from it may be alleviated, and cauterize the spleen also with the cautery according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 If the leprosy is already spread over the sick person and it is evident: then you must cauterize with these cauteries which we said in the head, and a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the two cheeks, and two cauteries on the spondyles of the neck, and six on the spondyles of the back, and one large one over the alhahosos near the gran caudae and one on it, in the almeidat: and two over the ankles: namely over every ankle with one, and two over the knees, and two over the shoulders, and two over the elbows, and two over the forearms, and two over the softnesses of the chest: and cauterize it over every joint of his fingers on both hands, and feet: and cauterize over all calcaneum of his feet, and focilia of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 Beware that you do not burn the nerves which are on top of the last heel bone, so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the chin, and another time on the belly, and another time on the epigastrium.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 And know that the more you add cautionary substances, the more beneficial it is, and the more conducive to success.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 And know that the sick do not feel pain in cautery, as the healthy do; therefore, because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 It is necessary that the cauteries be of suitable size and shape according to the members and joints; accordingly, they should be made from a particular type of iron.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the cautery with flour of herbs mixed with honey, and the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in stupor (faint or delirium).
Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When any member becomes numb and is treated with medicines, oils, plasters, and yet does not heal, then the affected member should be cauterized with cauteries according to the size or condition of the member.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 Let your cautery enter the thickness of the skin a little way.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with an ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 Furthermore, when the cautery is applied to some numbness that happens in the hand and foot, in the joints of the back near the nerve exits that move that member, the numbness will be removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 However, do not presume to act upon it unless he is wise in the knowledge of the structure of members and the exit of nerves moving the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 Chapter on Cauterization in Albaraz.
Caput LI.	 Title LXI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When Albaraz decays and does not offer any help from the art of medicine: then cauterize on top of it with a deep cautery a little way, according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and the color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with a mixture of grain of wheat, lentils with rose oil, leaves of arnoglossa, blood of a dove, and blood of a frog: equal parts of each: mix all these together, soak them on cloth, and apply them to the place until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 Chapter on Cauterization for Cancer.
Caput LII.	 Title LXII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as is customary.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 Wise men have said, it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 But that does not seem right to me, for I fear it would cause an ulcer; and I have already seen that happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 It is rather right to cauterize around it with a circular cautery, as we have said; or with multiple cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has Adubelati and it slows in maturation due to an excess causing it or due to the weakness of old age, when it is very few in blood, or due to time and you wish to hasten the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with small multiple cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then let it be released.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For itself it will hasten with maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then fire the cautery, whose form is this: (no further text provided)
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 And place it in the middle of the Adubelati until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be weak, so that its course may be made pure.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in a cancerous ulcer.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 Corrosion is only corruption walking in a limb and consumes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If you see a corrosion in a place that can bear cautery with fire, then apply much cautery, small and large nails, according to what suits the place where the corrosion is located.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it from all sides until you remove the entire corrosion, and nothing remains of it in depth.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then leave it for three days, and place over the cauterized places ground sulfur with oil until all scabs are removed and all corrosion.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then treat it with ointments that cause flesh to grow.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If therefore you see that after three days flesh is born through healthy growth, in which there is no corrosion, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery over what remains from the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 And corrosion is sometimes treated with a strong medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 Indeed, it arises in the place of cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 However, cautery with fire is quicker in helping: and I myself have already said that the cauterization of it with a strong medicine is in the division; therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing nails and warts.
Caput LV.	 Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 It often happens that this illness occurs in the lower parts of the feet and is bulky, filtered, which injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 Indeed, cautionery in these [cases] is according to two modes: cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 As for the cautery with fire, it is made concave like a bird's feather; which should be made of iron, according to the size that contains the nail from all sides; and it should be thin on the edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the hot iron on the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then turn the hand with the hot iron around the nail until the hot iron reaches the depth of the nail; and let it be for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then plaster it with wild herbs crushed with salt; and let the plaster remain on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 It will be uprooted from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat the place with a good ointment for flesh until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they are not converted and often recur on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet; then administer cautery with hot water: and it is, that you receive a cannula from brass, iron, or from an eagle's feather; and place it on the nail or ulcer.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula; hold your hand and turn it with the pressure of your hand for a while, so that the tip of the cannula is pressed against the root of the nail, and let the hot water find its way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait for a short time on the bite of the hot water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then let it go, as the nail will be uprooted with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Do this to them one by one, until you have reached all who are affected by it in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then care for them after they have been uprooted, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 Chapter on cauterizing tremor.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 66.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When trembling happens to anyone in a nerve due to cold, or quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the dorsal vertebrae, and with a cautery between each vertebra, and with a cautery on its chest, and with a cautery on its stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 The trembling ceases with cauterization by oil, and hastens the health of cold sickness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing Albatheer (Albucasis).
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 Sometimes Albathir expels from the body fetid matter, that is, pustules, which are produced by corrupted thick materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, first when they appear, it is necessary that they be cauterized over every head of the pustule with a subtle cautery and myrtle wood, whose tip is ignited with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with a root of long arista-lochia (Aristolochia).
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are cauterized with ademenes (adena), at the beginning of its expulsion according to this method; and they do not increase; and the excess is cut open making them, and heals from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, it must be done after evacuation with phlebotomy (bloodletting).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in bleeding from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Many times there is bleeding from an artery which has been cut at a wound, which happens externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a member, and similar cases; and it is difficult to separate it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 Therefore, when it happens to someone, then you quickly go with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it; and press strongly, until the blood is compressed under your finger, and nothing escapes from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place in fire a small oil lamp cautionery, and many of them more: and blow upon it until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is broken, and place the cautionery upon the vein, after which you remove your finger quickly: and hold the cautionery until the blood is severed.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If it is expelled with the removal of your finger from the opening of the artery and you extinguish the cautionery, then take another cautionery quickly, from those which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore, do not stop doing that with one after the other until the blood is severed.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And beware, lest you burn the nerve that is there, and an additional harm falls upon the already weakened person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to sever it: particularly because the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautionery, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is extracted, the ends of it contract and the blood is severed.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or it is tied with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or medicines that have the property of stopping bleeding are placed upon it and it is compressed with a suitable tourniquet.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 He who administers the amputation with a ligature and compression with cloth, or by placing hot things upon it and similar ones, does not give him completely, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 If that happens to someone and the doctor is not present nor medicine: then let him begin with the position of the index finger upon the opening of the vein as we said, and compress it very strongly, until the blood is besieged from above the wound, and upon the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 Do not remove the finger, upon it always apply cold water of violent coldness until the blood freezes and swells, and then cut it off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile consider what requires cautery or medicine in it.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 Section on Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in Wounds and their Types.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 As we have said in Chapter One, every disease in which it is appropriate to use fire as cautery and burning medicine, and the occasions for this, causes of this, tools for this, and forms of cautery are mentioned.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And I have placed chapters from the head down to the feet there.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that the sought-after information may be alleviated for those seeking it.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, you must know that what is in this chapter comes from the fear of what was in Chapter One on cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And because of that, there should be greater caution in it since in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood often occurs, with which life stands when a vein is opened or an incision made on an abscess, or an opening made for excretion, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of arrows, or incision on a stone, and their similar occurrences; from all of these are associated tremor, fear, and death occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you not to fall into that in which there is hesitation, for sometimes men of this art fall into it with the modes of weakness.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For there is one who gets angry with his illness and death is easy for him because of the violence that comes from his weakness and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when illness is from fear, it signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And he who gives his trumpet to you and promises health with it, hoping for salvation, but his illness is fatal.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you in such a manner.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 And let your caution be greater than your greed and your avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume about anything from him unless after certain knowledge, which will be verified by a praiseworthy outcome for you.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And in the treatment of all your sick ones, use prognostication and indication about that to which it properly belongs to be health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For in him there is help for you concerning the acquisition of fame and glory, memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 God will inspire you, O sons, with His understanding, and not take from you direction and inspiration; for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And I myself have arranged this chapter by dividing it into sections according to what came before in the chapter on Cautery, from neck to feet; so that your question may be alleviated which you desire from him, and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 Chapter on the treatment of water collected in children's heads.
Caput I.	 Chapter 1:
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this weakness often occurs in children during childbirth: or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And also it sometimes occurs due to hidden causes which are not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And indeed I myself have not seen this illness in anyone but children: and to every one of them that I have seen death followed: for this reason it appeared to me that the operation should be abandoned in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And indeed I myself have seen a child whose head was filled with water and his head swelled every day until he could not sit on himself due to the size of his head: and moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 And this moisture, it accumulates between skin and bone: or accumulates under the bone on the skull.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation on him, if there is moisture between skin and bone, and an abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a crack in the middle of the head, one fissure in width: and the length of the fissure should be like two fingers, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the shape of an enostome (spatula).
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If therefore the moisture has increased more and the abscess is larger, then place these two fissures, according to this shape.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moisture is under the bone and its sign is that you see the openings of the skull everywhere: and water is pressed when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide from you: then it is necessary to make three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after the incision, extract all the moisture entirely.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then tie the fissures with linen and wool threads.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then anoint it above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then remove the bandage, and take care of the wound with ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And thou shalt not loosen to bind the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 Feed the sick man with any dry food of slight moisture, until he strengthens the limb and is healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another method of cutting is to consider where it appears that the abscess is in size, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 For sometimes it is in the occiput more, or in the head, or in the right, or in the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Then rise with cutting where it appears to you that there is an abscess and filling of water; and cut it, according as it is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe that you do not cut an artery, and let blood flow, and the sick man dies from this flow along with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 Chapter on the incisions of the arteries that are after the ears.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When catarrh happens to someone's eyes or chest, and it becomes chronic and medical treatment does not help: then the last cure is in that, incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when one wishes to cut them (the arteries), let the sick person shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let the sick person tighten his neck with any cloth he has.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then observe where the vein pulsates.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And the places of both (arteries) are the places that are depressed behind the ears and rarely hidden except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark both (arteries) with wax on each side and cut one on each side with a knife, the incision reaching to the bone, making it wide across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you wish, insert the knife under the artery and cut it above with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 And let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating exit, which leaps to the inner parts with frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 If the artery does not appear to the sight, then it is necessary that the measurement of space from the ear should be three fingers in width.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with wax and cut through to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And what must be expelled from blood is about six ounces and perhaps you will expel more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 All of this should be done according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the sick person and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then observe for a wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 And if there remains some flesh on the bone after the wound, then cut it so that an abscess does not form; then bind the wound with linen rags.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with an ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 On the Extraction of Arteries which are in the Temples.
Caput III.	 Third Chapter:
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When an old hemicania or acute catarrh occurs in a man due to acidulous humidities and warmth in the temples, or an old soda, violent, and similar: and it is treated with methods of curing medicine, but it does not improve: then we are experienced in these illnesses in the extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have told.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 And the method of operation for their extraction is that the sick hairs which are on the temples are shaved off, and he should direct himself to the appearing artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 Itself is shown to you by its pulse, and it seldom hides except in a few men or extreme coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it is hidden to you, then the sick man should press his head with any cloth of his, and then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or apply heat to the place with hot water, until it appears to you in a clear manifestation.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take the cannula, which I have prepared previously.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then burn away the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then insert the hook into it, and pull it out upwards until you pull it out of the skin, and make it come out from all sides through the layers that are under it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If, however, the artery is delicate: then roll it up with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut the part according to its length so that its ends are drawn together and contracted, and there is no blood flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not cut and separated, the blood does not rise up deep within.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then let six ounces of blood flow out, up to one-third.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large: then it must be tied in two places with a double thread, strong, of silk; or with alum threads, so that decay does not occur near it before the wound is healed, and there is no blood flow.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut the surplus which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this at that hour, or another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a knife-shaped cautery, until its edges are cut through and it remains in place for this same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And it is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or is affected by calefaction.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because the cautery is made of those things which help to end moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it is better as a remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the extraction of the arteries, it is necessary that the place be filled with cooked old material; and pulverized lice should be placed on top of it evenly.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after the dissolution (of pus or inflammation), it is to be cured with dry medicines which cause new flesh to grow, and with linen, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If during the operation, bleeding occurs from an artery, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or fill the place with alum; and press your hand until the bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If there is nothing available to you from those things (to stop the bleeding), then place your finger on the place until it becomes frozen.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And irrigate the place with water of intense cold, until the pain subsides and it is bound according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And from what is lighter and easier to extract, it is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives; and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to alum.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 Nevertheless, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Because if they are as sharp as two knives, cold should be applied to each; and they will not cut through the flesh quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 When there is a certain amount of swelling in them, heat from fire should be applied and the flesh should be quickly cut off: when this operation is needed, it is better than any other work, and easier and less laborious.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 The space between the two knives should be the size of a finger's width after you mark two locations with pitch; then place both heated [instruments] closely, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between the extremities may be removed.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 They do not fully coagulate with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the shape of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 Chapter on the care of chronic, acute tear ducts from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When the tears are chronic and there is a channel from the veins that are on the outside of the skull of the head; and if no medication for healing is applied to them with medications, then you will see the face of the sick person becoming red, and it feels like walking as ants do on the forehead: and the eyes are weakened, moist, so that the hair has already been corroded by the corrosion: and the eyelids have been heated due to the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients resorted to this treatment for them, and they called it a cure with a knife.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And you should advise the sick person to shave the hairs on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three incisions on the forehead equal in length to the forehead; and let the length of the incision be like two fingers, and let one incision be at the same level as the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second one slightly below the movement of the arms, and the third one on the other side: and avoid cutting the arteries that are on the sides; and stretch your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all incisions be the size of three joined fingers: and prepare a piece of sponge or dry cloth with which you can absorb blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert a probe with two sharp ends, which follows this form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the incision on the side of the temple, up to the second incision: excise along with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, together with the sifac which is above the eye.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do the same from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove this probe and insert another tool called a sharp scapel into the first incision, with the blunt side from one end, not the sharp side from the other end.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place the sharp side of it towards the attached flesh with the skin, and the blunt side towards the bone; and push it in until it reaches the midline; and cut along with it all the contents that descend from the head to the eyes, except that it is connected by an incision up to what appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then do the same in the midline up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And when an equal amount of blood flows out, squeeze the places from the clots of congealed blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place a linen cloth from an old garment into every fissure and place over them pledgets soaked in wine, oil or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And see to it that no hot abscess occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 And on the third day, loosen the ligature and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it with basilicon ointment, and the other remedies used for wounds until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 Chapter on the treatment of sharp tears and catarrhs of the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When sharp, acute, frequent catarrhs occur to someone; and you see the eyes of that person weakened, small, and already the appearance is diminished; and the eyelids are ulcerated, hairs fall out from them, and in the depth of the head there is severe pain, which hurts, and sneezing follows: then take from these symptoms, that those substances, and catarrhs do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 A better treatment for them is this one.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it should be ordered that the sick person shave their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make a single cut in the middle of the forehead or slightly less wide, and start with the cut from the left temple to the right temple; let the incision go as far as the bone; and move your hand away from the temples that are moved during chewing until the bone is exposed; then dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate the edges of the wound with spatulas or linens.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then pull together with sutures and soak the sutures with wine and oil to prevent a hot abscess from forming.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you loosen that (the suture), and see that a hot abscess is beginning to subside; then it is necessary to scrape the bone until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then care for the bone with dry dressing to make flesh grow; as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of pitch, prepare a plaster from it and administer it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 [Section title: Treatment for injury to the ear]
Caput VI.	 Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either it is a mineral stone, or resembling a stone such as iron and wax; or it is from a plant, like chickpea and beans; or it is fluid, like water, vinegar, and similar things; or it is an animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When therefore a stone falls into the ear or any other kind of stone that does not grow in the ear, expose only the ear: if you see a stone then pour something from violated oil or sisamo into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer the extraction of it and make him sneeze with a snuff containing catharpic herbs, and close the nostrils near the onset of sneezing, when you place around the ear fragments from cloths or wool, and stretch the ear upward.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 For many times it comes out with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not come out, then administer the extraction of it with Guesthwi, that is, finely ground pigeon droppings; its form is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If it comes out with guesthwi, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a fine blind hook few times.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If it does not come out through that, then make a tube from copper and introduce the end of the tube into the ear opening as much as possible, and close what is around the tube with beeswax softened with oil so that there is no way for the wind except the tube; then extract it with your strong suction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 For many times it comes out with what I have said.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If it does not come out this way: then take from helkalimb or urine, that is gluten prepared as birds are caught, a small amount; and place it at the end of the radius when you place a well-centered cup over it; then introduce it into the ear opening with ease after you have pulled the ear away from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If it does not come out with all that I have mentioned, then hurry to cut, before a hot abscess or a spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 The method of lancing is as follows: first, the unwell person should be lanced in the head; and extract from him according to the strength of the phlebotome.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and make a small incision in the base of the ear at the fat in the depressed place; let the incision be in the shape of the moon until you reach the stone; then remove it with what is possible for you with your tools.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then lance the incision from your own time and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If something falling into the ear is one grain or more, which swell and grow; then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 But if it does not obey you for the evacuation, then take a thin, subtle probe according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer with it the cutting of that species from grains which fall into the ear, and do not do this when you think that the grain is already wet by earwax, until you put a lot of it; then remove it with forceps or with a fine probe or with suction, as we said, for the extraction of it is alleviated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 In water that enters the ear, the sick person should use sneezing when he first lies down; and his ear has already been filled with some cooked old one; it is lying on top of it where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If it comes out through this, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 If not, then take many small stones according to the length of the finger, soft and smooth, and heat them slightly with fire; and the sick person should insert one from these into the ear's opening; and let him sprinkle water on one foot from that side, and strike the stone in the ear with another stone.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Therefore, it should not cease to be done with the stone and the stone, until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And now the water is coming out so that you may take one from parchment or reed and insert its end into the ear; and heat the other end with fire until it burns most of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then take another reed and do the same thing many times until all the water comes out; and draw it out with a cannula according to what was stated above concerning the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 In the case of an animal entering into it (the ear), if its body is small, like a louse or similar, care for it as I said in the section on division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it is of a large body, which appears to the senses: then administer its extraction with tweezers and hooks; and its removal is easier for all those who are holding onto the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 In the case of worms generated in the ear, when you care for it with what I said in the section on division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you should look at the ear in sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If therefore something appears there from worms, then draw it out with tweezers or fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 If nothing appears there, then take a cannula with this shape: narrow below and wide above; and insert its fine end into the ear according to the amount that the sick person can tolerate; then suck with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Do it many times until all worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 If they do not obey you for their exit, then use poppy seeds surrounded by a cannula with wax as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 If they do not come out with what I said: then administer the distillations that the ancients were experienced in for the destruction of worms; and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your drainage be with oil and medicine into the ear using this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you see, make it from silver or brass, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Therefore, let what is within the concavity of the tube (cannula) be made of brass.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take radium (a heated metal) and wrap it at the end with a suitable covering; then pour oil, juice, or any of these medicines into the cannula; let it be in the ear; then introduce the heated radium with the covering on top, and press it gently with your hand until the oil is forced out into the concavity of the ear, and the sick person feels it inside; and whatever is poured into the ear should already have been slightly heated by fire. And take care that no substance distilled in it is very cold; medicines cannot tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 [Chapter title] On the treatment of a perforated ear.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 Whenever some infants are born from their mothers' wombs without being perforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it also happens to some people that the perforation of the ear occurs from a wound or tissue born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this perforation sometimes occurs in the deep part of the ear canal, which does not affect vision; and sometimes it occurs near the outer part of the ear canal and affects vision.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, the one that occurs in the deep part of the ear, which does not affect vision, is difficult to cure in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in the one that affects vision, it is necessary to place the sick person's ear on the sun and observe it; then if you see the perforation, open it with a fine spatula whose shape is as follows: its end should have a small notch, part of which is sharp; the rest of the spatula should be flat on both sides to avoid damaging the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If therefore an opening is born from the flesh within the ear: then hold it with a delicate hook, and cut it with great force, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If therefore an ulcer is deep within the ear: then take a thin probe, soft and warm it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If therefore you find an ulcer accompanied by weakness and difficulty of hearing: endeavor to open it with ease; but be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place a linen cloth of the size of the opening you have made in the ointment of Egypt; do this for several days until you are certain that the wound has healed.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take linen and immerse it in rosewater, powderize upon it the ground zinc, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see the ear already discharging pus: then extract the linen and allow it to dry with another piece of linen which has been soaked in a pot made with rose oil, until the warm pus settles; then take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If bleeding occurs: then immerse sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the ear; and use the rest of the treatment to stop the described bleeding using methods of distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 Chapter on the care of Althaea's (Marsh-mallow) eyelids.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 Those Althaea's which occur on the eyelids of eyes, are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore they should be held with tweezers or with a hook, and cut from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then apply ground zinc on the place.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If blood flows from them, then cauterize with a fine lens-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And it is better to cauterize [the wound] after making an incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 For many times they come back when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 Chapter on the care of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Often something happens in the eyelids that resembles sand in its firmness and hardness, and it is called gravel due to this. And it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore, the operation for this is to see if there is gravel proceeding from it, which appears in the eyelid, and to move it around in all parts, and its nature is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Find therefore a fissure over it in length.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then scrape it off from all sides with ease, until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hang it up with a hook and cut it off itself.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 If however you do not prepare to cut it off unless after you have pierced the eyelid with a slight incision, then it may harm the weak in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If however there is a large fissure: then bind it up with suture: and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no harm will come to you from that.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 Oil therefore restores it and fills it in.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 If the gravel is directed towards the inside of the ear and turned on the inner surface, then turn the eyelid over, hang the gravel with a hook: besides which you will need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 If the eyelid is stretched by an incision, then it will not harm anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then clean the eye after the gravel incision with salty water, and care for the place with it until the weak heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 [Title: On the Care of Eyelids.]
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 The adhesion (Axirnath) is a deposit that is generated in the outer layer of the upper eyelid; and it most certainly occurs in children; and it weighs down their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot look at the light of the sun, because tears flow towards them, and because of this you see them lying on their faces constantly, and they sleep on these, and their eyelids are always wet under the eyebrows, which has already been covered by swelling; and the appearance of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath among them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 The method of its operation is that the sick one places his head in your armpit.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a clean cloth and prepare within it linen, and make from it a circle according to the size that contains Axirnath on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then place him upon it and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in the middle of this humidity with a blunt probe producing cracks along its width, and let the crack not be larger than that which is made during venesection in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 Or it is necessary that you find the entire skin until you reach Axirnath, for in many dispositions, the Axirnath proceeds from the crack according to the shape of a fatty white peach pit.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 So draw it out with the cloth that you have moistened between your fingers on the outside; and you shall turn your hand from right to left until it is dispersed; be careful not to add in the crack so as not to reach with the probe to the eye, and do not harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 If it does not appear to you at first that the Axirnath is in the crack, you should gently add more in the crack until the Axirnath comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then draw it out as we said before.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot and press with small stones.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And among men there are those who grind salt, and they place it in the hollow of the crack, so that what remains from that moisture softens.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If there occurs in the spot an abscess that is hot, then care for it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 Part on the methods of A taximir eyes, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft, so that it droops as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs grow in the eyelids over and above the course of natural hairs, and become old: then they harm the eye, and bring about types of diseases, such as constant tearing, softening of the eyelids, and clouding, until that cause results in the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And Ataxmir indeed is cured according to four modes.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or with sharp medicine, according to what was mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 The sentence translates to: "It is treated by incision and suturing (of) Ataxmir.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 "Or by cannulas, as I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 "It is necessary that you place the head of the sick (person) in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 "Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 "Therefore, if it is turned (back), it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 "And if not: introduce the needle into it (the eyelid), where there is a thread from its lower part of the eyelid, and let the needle penetrate through the thread above, and let it be near hairs themselves or close to the margin of the eyelid, where hairs grow: and pull the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it with the rod.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 "Then find (the) conjunctiva on the inside of the eyelid, under added hairs, where the spatula meets from the greater lacrimal to the lesser lacrimal.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 "Then extract the thread and place a small amount of cotton or cloth under the eyelid; then mark the eyelid with wax, so that it is like the figure of the leaf of myrtle.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 "However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: because it varies greatly among humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 "For there are those who need to be cut according to the size of the eyelid, in accordance with the softening (of) the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 "Then with the spatula find (the) two lines that you have marked, and start from the greater lacrimal to the lesser lacrimal, and let there be a split near natural hairs, as the thickness of a rod.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 "Then insert the hook into one (of) the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 "Then scrape it completely.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 "Then join the two lips with a suture using a sharp needle and thin woolen thread; remove blood and make the excess from the threads adhere to the eyebrows, if you want to do this: and if not, do not treat it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then let the suture go and the threads until three days, or four: afterwards take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish, let the wound heal without suture, and take care of it so that it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid is to be raised during sealing of the wound and its dressing; but it will be better in future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of healing they taught, the ancients.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 Yet there is concern for the sick one in it, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another method is also in Ataxmir: and it is to make signs on the eyelid with a shape like that of a myrtle leaf, as we have told before.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then lift the eyelid with three separated or joined uncini, according to the following shape, then cut what is excessive with small forcipes according to this shape, with equal incisions.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If it is not possible for you to hold the uncinus, and it does not match; then take a needle with thread, and insert it in the middle of the shape: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and another thread near the smaller tear duct: and bind threads between your fingers with equal tension.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then lift your hand equally with the lever: and lift the skin over which the incision is made, as we have told before.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind together the two lips of the wound with suture: and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If however an abscess occurs at your incision or split; sew up the abscess with wax and similar materials from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes the eyelashes also turn over.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to use what we have said in the incision: but suture for both is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 Treatment for Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 It is necessary to turn the eyelid and make a cut along the inner fissure, as I have previously described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then, using skill, make two small dogs or thin sticks of such length as that of the eyelid and narrower than the distance between the teeth; and you have already made incisions at both ends near where the sutures are located on either side.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then gather both together with finesse on that which projects from the eyelid of the eye, and bind two small dogs tightly from either side with a strong ligature, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 For the contracted skin will die, darken, and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If it slows down (the dying process), then make incisions with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 When it has solidified, lift the eyelid and do not pluck out the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the shape of two dogs which you will make according to this form and size in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 On plucking out hairs that are pricking in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The operation is to take a fine needle and thread a thin silk filament through it gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then gather the ends of this together and tie both with a very fine knot; let the length of the filaments be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then prepare another thin silk filament shorter than the first and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Place the patient's head on your lap and let it be close to the sun so that the operation can be seen; because this is a subtle or small operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert the needle with the thin silk into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you pull out the natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then pull out the needle above the aneurysm and insert it into the aneurysm. If there is one, or two, or three, do not more than that.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then draw your hand with it, until the needle comes out with the aneurysm along with the natural hair of the eyelid.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If the aneurysm is drawn out and the needle does not come with it: draw the aneurysm downwards with the thread you have made in it, until the aneurysm comes out through the upper opening, and you see it with the eye. Then draw out the aneurysm and the thread, and remove both, and close the eye; and let it remain closed for two or three days, until the hair grows back to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is short, then attach a long hair from the natural hairs and draw it out with it; or let it be until it grows longer, and then draw it out.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 Chapter on the treatment of the Xanthema that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this Xanthema happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this Xanthema is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Therefore, the accidental one results from the consolidation of a wound, a cut, a cauterization, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 And the method of treatment is to find the consolidated area and separate its lips, and place a linen cloth in it, and tie it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 Do not use on its treatment things that dry and constrict it; for if you do so, the Xanthema will return worse than before; rather, use things that soften it, such as fenugreek; and embrocation with water in which althea has been boiled, with flaxseed; and unguento dyaquilon, which has been made liquid with some oil; and anoint with this linened cloth and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 Thy treasure of cure is that thou strive with all thy wit, so that it not be consolidated, according to the form which it was firstly.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 This operation indeed that I said is no more than a correction of Alzahrak, so that the form of the place does not return to what it was altogether.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 On the care for Alzahrak in the lower eyelid, and it is a wrinkle or contraction upward towards right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This that is below, is that which is truly named Alzahrak.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the accidental arises from wound, or split, or cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 And the way of operation in it is that thou takest a needle, in which there is double thread, and thou dost anoint it with flesh, and maketh it penetrate from tear-duct left to tear-duct right, until the thread cometh at two extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then extend the flesh upward with a needle, and cut it with a wide knife.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If therefore the form of the eyelid returns as it ought to be, that is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take a cautery, and place it in the split, and turn with it the eyelid; and make two splits on the inner side of the eyelid, and let them be extremities of two splits from two corners of the cut, until they come together and make an angle: until when they are gathered together, this figure is made, and it is the letter lambda (λ) Greek.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that flesh by measure, which is its acute lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then gather together the separated parts; or it with thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them with what we said about softening medicines and liniments until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 If Alxatrati occurs from a fissure, and suture or cautery: then it is necessary to clean the fissure flat under eyelashes, as previously described.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate with a linen cloth, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 The summary of the treatment for Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is to perform the operation according to how it is prepared in the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 For it has many variations in shape: and the skillful craftsman prepares his intellect with whatever method is possible for him, so that he may return the figure to its natural form or close to it, and the sick person himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in various positions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 Chapter on the adherence of the eyelid with conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid adheres with whiteness of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, you should insert the tip of the rod under the eyelid and push it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula without sharpness, but rather slightly blunt: so as not to disturb the sick one during the operation, and remove the spatula, and harm the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be like you peel off that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the adhesion is healed completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then pour salty water into the eye, while washing it with water: or drip it onto him from a syringe made of sheep's horn, or from vinegar diluted with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen cloth: and put wool soaked in egg white over the eye: and after three days, use vinegar, and with solidified substances, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 Chapter on the Incision of the Toenail and Protrusion of Skin around the Eyes.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the toenail is in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Or it is horny and is like a hard shell, subtle.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or it is not horny, similar to frozen white moisture: which when touched with iron or attempted to be picked up with a hook, is cut off and the hook does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And neither of these types starts unless from the greater tear duct, until it gradually reaches the eye, covering it and preventing light, and moving the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation in the incision is: that the sick person places his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open his eyes and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Take a few of the nails with a small forceps and extend it towards the upper part.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take a point and insert it into the hair of horse, ox or sheep; let it be a thread, and slightly sharpen the tip of the needle and fasten it in the middle of the nail; push it with the needle and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it towards the upper part; scrape off the side of the nail following the pupil, as if you were holding it with the hair up to its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remaining part at the root of the lacrimal duct with a thin spatula or with small forceps; and let the natural flesh of the lacrimal pass through, so that not due to the incision there is a continuous flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And when the nail extends with a nail pick only; or with thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then it is scraped with a soft spatula, whose form this is.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And be careful that the spatula does not touch the corneal membrane and there is a rupture, and the pupil is pierced through.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, throw something crushed salt or made from snow into the eye and let it remain until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it with what is necessary, until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the nail is not nerve-related and you cannot insert an awl into it or a pick does not fit into it, then this type of nail is frequently treated with medications and heals as I said in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you want to cut it, then open the eye of the sick person and take a thin, soft, fragile spatula with blunt end, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And smooth down the nail with a razor of fine sharpness.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it thickens and cracks, and the razor presses into it, then pour snow made from your snow or red snow or crushed salt onto the eye and cover the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat the operation until the entire thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless it is a warm abscess in your eye; then let that be and treat the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the operation on it with a razor until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 Prominence of the tear duct (lacrimal caruncle), if it causes great harm to the eye, should be suspended with a hook and a portion of it cut off; not at the very end, so as to avoid damage to the tear ducts.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then drain the pus from the tear duct (lacrimal) or make it red (rubefy), or apply a mustard poultice until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 Chapter on incision of Alguardenic and the flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 When the red flesh is born in certain human eyes, composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, approaches, or contracts over the eyelids and perhaps turns the eyelids toward the outside; it resembles a balaustine rose.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And there is also an operation for this: that you place your head on your shoulder.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open the eyes of this person and collect the entire flesh with appropriate hooks; hold it with a single forceps or tweezers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then cut the flesh at first until you finish the whole thing with a knife.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 And be careful not to harm the eye during the operation; make your cut be such that you cut it (the flesh), or with a spatula, as we said in the incision of the nail; or with small forceps, as used for collecting scabs, according to what shape it will take after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 When your cut is completed and the entire Alguardenic is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or pour in red powder and similar to it from corrosive medicines; place a piece of cow's fat on the outer eye with egg white: to protect it from hot infection.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If there remains anything of Alguardenic and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess; then let the eye be, and treat the abscess with what calms it.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the procedure over him until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And likewise do with the added flesh that occurs in the eye of this type.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 However, it is necessary that all weak eyes, whether from natural causes or accidental ones, be treated with the iron: and do not introduce your hand into any of these operations until you see that the limb can bear this operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 Chapter on removing a Sebula from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 A sebula is a red vein that covers the eye and prevents the operation of sight; and it weakens the eye day by day.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 Therefore, first you must determine if the eye in which there is a sebula is strong and there is no other illness besides the sebula; then remove the sebula from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And it is to be ordered that the weak one should put his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend the veins with a single hook or two according to your discretion; and let the hook be fine of double thickness, in this shape, or let there be two hooks in one body, in this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then remove the veins with fine forceps with precision and let the blood be drained an hour after an hour until you see the veins removed from the eye and resolved; and be careful not to harm the eye with the points of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 Let your work be done at midday under the sun, and let you be very firm in your operation; so that you do not cut except the veins themselves.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished, then pour into the eye either green or red; so that its sharpness may burn what remains of the sebula.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If it is not possible for you to remove it all in that hour, then cover the eye with plaster, so as to ease the pain of the eye; and leave it for a few days until the pain subsides; and apply heat to it; then repeat the procedure according to the same method until healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 Of the Reduction of a Sore Nasal (Nasal Abscess).
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 The surgeon named Arisatha treats a fistula, which he cures with a cautery or with medicine burning sharply, according to the account that precedes it.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 And if it is not cured, then there is no skill in it: except to open an abscess at its birthplace, and draw out all the moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 When the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackening in it, then scrape it with an instrument that has this shape.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 It is called the scraper of the skull.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Make it from iron indo and let its head be round like a compass (azir), with tiny holes made by the grinding of a file or a fine, pointed tool: place it on the corrupted part of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then turn it with your fingers and press your hand slightly, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with dry, astringent medicine.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place consolidates and flesh grows up there, and the flow of pus ceases: and it remains for forty days without being renewed or abscessed, and no incident occurs in it: then you will know that it is cured.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this shape.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And it is to expose the second bone with iron or with sharp medicine: when the bone is exposed, then take a trephine according to this shape, its tip should be triangular and iron at the end: and the wood of the trephine should be extended like a pyramid until the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it on the bone itself: let it be close to the tear duct, and extend your hand slightly from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn your hand with the lancet until it penetrates the bone and feels weak. By this you will find air escaping from it when you hold your hand over its nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Then restore the place with drying medications, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 When the flesh is born and the place hardens, then the matter that flowed outward returns to the nose; therefore it becomes lighter above the weakened (wound).
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 Chapter on reducing protuberance of the Eye.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye protrudes completely and no visual harm or diminution occurs, then it should be softened; then use a phlebotome on it; afterwards place fumigating vapors on the neck without making incisions, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then place over the eye a poultice made from acacia, aloe, myrrh and saffron.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then compress the eyelid tightly above with plaster containing many small lumps.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the method of small lumps is to take soft cloths, many, and cut all the cloth into four equal pieces; make many from them; then place one over another according to the quantity required by the eye; then compress strongly upon them with a strong bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat this fumigating vapor with suction but without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the fumigating vapors and allow the eyelid to remain closed during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If the bandage becomes soft again, then it should be tightened very much; then remove the bandage after a day and night, as previously mentioned.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If you see the eye has returned to its normal state, that is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, small lumps, tightening bandage, and fumigating vapors until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 On the incision of the empty bladder.
Caput XXI.	 Cum in urinando, si vis inspexeris
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 If you observe urination and it breaks, then a bladder stone is emitted outside the eyes like a grain of sand and it spoils human form due to this, and the urge to cut it arises: then operation on him is performed as I have told, and it is, that you insert a probe from the base of the bladder from below towards the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another probe with a double thread from the lachrymal side and make it penetrate, and release the first probe according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut the place of the double thread and bind a part of the bladder around the probe with it and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then remove the probe, and place wool soaked in oil over the eye and let it go until the thread comes out with the bladder.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 After that, take care of the eye with something that comforts it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes the bladder is tightened all around with a bandage of cloth until the eye protrudes greatly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then it is perforated with a fine spatula that reaches to the depth of the eye, and moisture of the conjunctiva is let out and the eye descends, and enters immediately; then bind it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 On the treatment of Alopecy.
Caput XXII.	 Cum uir aliquis aetas uigilet
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This disease that is called Alopecy, is nothing but pus that gathers in the eye, similar to water descending and it is not the same.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the method of operation on this is, that you make him sit on a prepared chair or a straight one.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take his head with both your hands from the sides and shake him until you see pus reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then it is fashioned and does not descend, and the passage is opened: let the sick one see as he saw before: and if it does not descend further, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 But if no descent of pus occurs with what was said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a fine probe and puncture it together with the cyst at the junction of the conjunctiva and the corneal membrane in the corona, until the pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When it comes out, then pour warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey; or warm water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; afterwards treat with the remainder of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 On the cure of water that descends into the eye or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have already said the appearance of water in division and which is suitable for puncturing when it speaks and expands, then take the same according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit facing your hands, opposite the light, near the sun; and tie the healthy eye, and press it hard; afterwards close the eyelid of the affected eye with your right hand, if the water is in the left eye; or with your left hand, if it is in the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take your right hand, if the affected eye is the left; or your left hand, if it is the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the tip of your thumb near the cornea on the white part of the eye visible as the smaller lacrimal; then press with force; and you turn with it your hand, until it penetrates into the white part of the eye; and feel that your thumb has reached a void area.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And it is necessary that the measurement of the journey be great enough for depth, the measure of the space which is from the pupil until the end of the blackness: and it is the corona of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 You will see this in itself in the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea coat.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place a great [distance] until the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it downwards once after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that which opens his sight immediately, and a great [distance] in his own eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If therefore the water descends, then place it again, except that the great [distance] comes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When therefore it is pressed and does not rise: then extract the great [distance] with ease; and you turn your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve something from clear salt in water: and cleanse the eye with it inside.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place outside the eye all flaxseed or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white: and bind the healthy eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 We, and those who are of our time, place upon him caraway seed ground with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the great [distance] does not obey you in entering into the eye because of its hardness, since it is a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take the spathule which is called Albarid, whose form is as follows.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Therefore pierce it with it only the conjunctiva, and not your hand into the opening: and it is not until you make a way to the great place subtle.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then insert the great [distance], as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 And for the completion of your work, prepare for the sick a bed properly made, in which he will sleep on his back in a dark house: and prevent him from all movements, and from coughing: and place his food that softens his nature: and do not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the suture be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then dissolve it in that dark place and test its sight: let it see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then return the suture until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it is not proper to do that at the hour of cure, or immediately after the incision; on the contrary, it should be left to others, because water rises quickly through a violent wound.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If it happens to be a hot abscess: then it is necessary to dissolve the eye before the seventh day; and correct it with what soothes the abscess until it is soothed; then without its sight, place it on his face orally, which regulates its vision for several days, as long as it remains in that dark place.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then he should go out of the house gradually, and convert himself to his own cases.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that in surgery a student is not excused from observation often; then he dares to perform an operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And indeed a certain one of those from Alayrach has come to us who said that a wound was perforated in Alayrach, through which water flows out.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Therefore I have not seen anyone in your country who has done that; nor read it in any of the old books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 And these are the shapes of species from magdan, to stand over him who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Make them out of bronze; and let the ends of them be with this same triangular subtlety, and the end sharp.
Formae magda.	 Shapes of magdan.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 Chapter on care of newborn flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Sometimes numerous different types of flesh are born in the nose, one of which resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from this is cancerous flesh, stony, dark colored; and from this is soft flesh, not dark colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore, for the soft flesh among these that is not fraudulent nor cancerous, you should have the sick person sit facing the sun with his nose opposite it, and then open his nostrils; next, insert a hook into those fleshes; then pull them out towards the exterior; and cut what you have caught with a subtle, sharp spatula on one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If something remains of that which cannot be cut off: then shave it with a small and gentle instrument until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If blood controls you or a hot abscess occurs: then oppose it with what is necessary; or if it is from malicious abscesses, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is separated, and all the flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then vinegar, water or wine should be poured into the nose after the cut.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If the nose opens and moisture comes out to the palate, then you know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If the moisture does not penetrate as required, then you know that there is flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, which was not reached by the cut with the instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Therefore, you should insert a linen thread with several knots and let the sick person send one end of the filament into his nose with a reed or whatever he can do after making it similar to a syringe; and draw out the smell until it reaches the skull, and comes out on top of the throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed many boys do something similar to what Attomus did in school, and it is an easy thing for him who wishes.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place two ends of the thread, one which comes out over the nose and the other which remains inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then with scissors, cut the flesh together with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do this until you know that the flesh is already with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then draw out the thread and place linen in the nose after bleeding has ceased, which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days or more, until the ointment completely eats away all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then put a tube made of lead at the end of the procedure into the nose for some days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If it requires drying treatment, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 For capping the head while oils and other medications are distilled into the nose, make it from silver or copper, similar to a small lamp, open like a shell and its opening likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish to make a closed tube, as a tube (cannula).
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the shell-shaped instrument for capping the head should be full, perforated: with a handle at its end, which you hold when heating oil or whatever you wish from distilled substances and liquids.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 Chapter on the care of the nose.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Often a Thelum grows at the tip of the nose and becomes more prominent with days, until its appearance becomes disgusting.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And for this reason it is necessary to cut off the beginning of its appearance and to remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place on that spot a caustic or burning medicine in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If therefore the incision is delayed until it enlarges, then consider if it is hard, stone-like, dark in color and has few senses: then do not touch it with iron, because the ulcer is cancerous.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 I have often seen that one who has incised a boil and malignancy has happened to the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the ulcer is soft when touched and not dark in color, and you see that an incision can be made throughout it, then evacuate the weakened part, and cut it without fear or concern, and care for the place with it, because it extracts and constricts it until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 Chapter on nasal suture, lip suture, and ear suture.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when dislocation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, the operation contributes little to it unless in certain men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when something happens to anyone from that, you must consider if it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then collect the edges of the wound with suture; then care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if the dislocation of continuity has already separated the lips and each part is healthy: then it is necessary to remove all the tissue from its visible skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then collect the two lips with suture, bind them and sprinkle powdered dragon's blood, pulverized aloes and asafoetida on top of it. Place a piece of emplaster (diafinicon) over the powders, and another consolidated emplaster. Leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then dissolve it (the suture) and change the medicine. Leave it until the threads are removed by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment until healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of suturing is that you gather the solution of continuity, or with needles, as we have told in abdominal suturing; or gather the solution with thread, as I have informed you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 On the extraction of lip nodules.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many men indeed have hard eruptions similar to grains of herbs on their lower or upper lips; some are smaller and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, one should turn the lip, find above every nodule of it, and hang it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after the incision with boiled linen cloth until the blood is separated.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then it is rubbed with vinegar and the place where there is an inflammation is treated with it until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 On the incision of the born flesh on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Often a flesh grows up over the gum which is called ablus by the ancients.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore, one should hang it with a hook; or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, and let pus or blood run out.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then put over the place boiled linen cloth, or other healing powders, drying.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often returns, then cut it a second time and burn it; for it does not return after being burned.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 On the scraping of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 When they are gathered on the surfaces of teeth from both the inner and outer parts, and between the gums and rough cortices, they become decayed, turn yellow and green, until corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and place his head in your lap, and grind away the cavity and tooth, where the cortices appear to you, until there remains nothing of them; similarly do for blackness, greenness, yellowishness, and others until they are clean.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If what is within them is removed at the beginning of the reasoning, it is good; and if not, then apply the razor to them on another day, on the second, and on the third, until finally your study reaches the end that you desire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that a tooth requires razors of various shapes and forms, many figures; according to what is prepared for your operation: because the razor with which a tooth is shaved from below is different from the razor with which it is shaved between teeth, in accordance with other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these shapes of razors should be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 Chapter on the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary that you cure the tooth from its own pain with all your skill, and proceed slowly in extracting it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For there is no substitute for it when it is extracted; because it is a substance that is raised up; until when there is no excuse for the extraction of it, then it is necessary when the patient is compelled to extract it himself, that he may be strengthened and assured by you that the tooth causing pain will be replaced.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 For often pain deceives the patient and believes that there is pus in the tooth and extracts it himself; then the pain does not subside until the diseased tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 When therefore it is certified to you that a hard tooth itself is painful, then it is necessary that you lancet around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something virtuous, until it softens from all sides: then move it yourself with your fingers, or with fine forceps first of all gently, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place large forceps in those places well, and hold the head of the weak between your knees: what you have already firmly held, so that it does not move: then pull out the tooth in a straight direction, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and introduce it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If however the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with a cloth and bind it with the end of a fine radius so as not to break it during your compression on it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And it is necessary that you be careful with the lancet around the gum from all sides much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And keep your strength so as not to break it and a part remains of it and returns to the weak from that illness which is greater in pain at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And be careful not to do what ignorant phlebotomists do in haste and the arrogance of their extraction, beyond what we have said.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For often they bring great illnesses upon men, whose more difficult ones are to break and all roots remain or some of them, or to extract it with certain bones of the jaw as we have testified many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then it is to be covered after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If there should be bleeding from the places (for it often happens), then rub something of the alum and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if you do not have alum.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The handles of the fine forceps by which the molars are moved should be long at the ends, short in the arms, heavy, so that they do not break when pressed on the teeth; they should be like those of large forceps, until they do not bite themselves or become bent when squeezed with them; the ends should be short, and made of hard iron, or skillfully made from brass, with sharp tips at the ends; and in their tips there should be teeth, some of which enter into others and tighten with a proper constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes the ends are like the shape of a bird's beak called "ciconia", and they are strong in constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 Chapter on Extraction of Teeth and Removal of Fractured Bone of the Jaw.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When a tooth that breaks off remains after its extraction, then it is necessary to place hot compresses with butter for one or two days until the location becomes softened; then introduce into it alum or forceps, whose tips resemble the beak of a bird called "ciconia".
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 The form is that of forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 The ends should be made like a plane blade or an aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If these forceps do not obey you in extraction, then it is necessary to cauterize the root and to peel off all the flesh and to introduce an instrument called "Palanca parua", whose form is as follows:
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 The extremity should be short and not too thick; and it should not be filled (or swollen), so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If the root comes out through (it), it is good; if not, help with other tools of similar form.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The first (one) has a triangle-shaped end, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 Triangle-shaped thin end.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 Also helps with this tool having two branches, which has this form.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other tools and implements that came before (in the ratio of teeth).
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 Also helps with this tool similar to a large nail, of the same form, triangle-shaped twisted end with some thickness, so that it does not break; and let it not be filled (or swollen).
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many tools for the teeth; and similarly, other implements are not counted; and the wise artisan, skilled in his art, finds for himself the tool according to what the operation and the disease itself require.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because among diseases there are those for which the ancients did not create a tool, due to the diversity of their forms.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If the bone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies; then examine it at its location with that which suits it among the tools and forceps mentioned for root extraction, and help with the one whose shape is this (described earlier).
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Let there be some thickness gradually, so that the bone can be pulled or held with it and does not escape and move, until the bone comes out; and restore the place with appropriate medicines for that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it off from its own putrefaction, and take care of it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 On the serration of protruding teeth.
Caput XXXII.	 De Serratura dentium quibusdam protrudent
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When some teeth protrude not according to their natural course, it gives rise to an ugly form, and especially when this happens in women and girls, that is to say, those of a venereal condition.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 The surgeon must examine the matter carefully.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 If a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit or can be serrated or filed, then pull it out; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it off with this tool, whose shape is as follows:
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It resembles a small beak made of iron and has an extremely sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 Make your cut several days apart, due to the hardness of the tooth and so as not to disturb another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 If it is protruding for filing, then file it with a file made of iron, whose shape is as follows:
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 The whole is made of ivory, and its handle is of many small points like a limed lime-stone, with which it is ground gradually for many days with ease, so as not to disturb the tooth, and fall: then smooth it with it, at the end, grind it again with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If it is a tooth, from which a part breaks and injures the tongue: then it is necessary that lime be applied to it, until the roughness of the fracture is removed, and it is made smooth: and it must not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 On the filing of teeth with gold threads.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When it happens to the front teeth that they are struck or shaken due to a blow or accident, and the weak person cannot hold what he eats lest it fall: and you have treated them with medicines for splints, and the treatment was not effective: then it is appropriate for them to be held together with a gold thread: because silver becomes green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let the thread be of intermediate fineness and thickness according to its quantity, which fits between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 And the form of filing is that you take the thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth: then you weave with two ends of the thread between the moved teeth, whether there is one or more, until you reach with the needle up to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then you weave again to the part from which you began: and tighten your hand with delicacy and wisdom until it is not moved at all: and let your compression, by which you hold the thread, be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not escape.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with scissors: and bring together both, and turn them towards yourself: and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moved tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue: then let it be so tightened until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it is opened or cut open, bind them with another thread and let it remain in that condition for a period of time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of the intertwining of two healthy teeth, and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And sometimes it happens that one tooth or two teeth return to their respective places after loss, and are retained as we have said, and remain: this does not happen unless the skilled and experienced craftsman performs it.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes a tooth is fashioned from the bones of a calf: and it is made like the form of a tooth, and placed in the place where it is secured and bound as we have said; and it remains, and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 Chapter on the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 Whenever this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural, when man is born, or accidental, from a healed wound.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 The procedure in this case is to open the weak bone in his head within your pouch, and raise his tongue; then cut the nerve-ligament across width until it is released from its hold.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 If there is something hard and knotted within it, and it comes from the consolidation of a wound; then throw an awl into it and split it across width until you cut the ligament, and the knotting is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And beware, lest there is a split in deep flesh, and you cut an artery there, and blood flows out.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then it is washed with water and rose petals or vinegar or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place a flax cloth from linen under the tongue for the patient to keep all night so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 If, however, there is blood flow, then place on it a piece of powdered hematite.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the blood overpowers you, then cauterize the place with a lentiginous cautery that suits it; then take care of him with the rest of the treatment until he is cured.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 Chapter on removing the ranula located under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Whenever under the tongue there occurs an aposteme resembling a small frog that prevents the tongue from performing its natural function; and it may perhaps grow so much that it fills up the bone.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the procedure is to open the weak bone facing the sun and examine the aposteme.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If you see it (the patient) of a dark or black color, hard, who does not have a weak sensation: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if it is hollowed out towards whiteness, in which there is moisture: then throw in a hook, and cut it with a thin spatula, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 What if blood constrains you during your operation hour? Then place upon it a piece of burnt alum, until the blood is cut off; then return to your operation, until you extract it with its contents.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then wash (it) with vinegar and salt; and take care of it with appropriate treatment until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 [Title: Treatment for an abscess of two tonsils]
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Whenever a swelling similar to goitre occurs near the throat, that is, glands, which are called double amygdalae: when you treat them as we have said in division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If the abscess is hard, dark colored, with few senses: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is red in color and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing blood flow, rather let it be until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Then either pierce it yourself: or it will burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is white in color, round and its root is thin: then it should be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the operation on it is that you consider before the operation itself if the abscess of it has ceased to be warm and completed its quiet, or it decreases somewhat: then let the patient sit in front of the sun, and his head should be in your lap: and open his mouth, and the servant holding him by hands, press his tongue downwards with the instrument whose form is as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be made of silver or copper, which should be thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 When you press the tongue with it and the abscess is shown to you, and it falls onto it under your sight: then take a hook, and attach it to the amygdala, and pull it out as far as possible, taking something from the tunics with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it with the instrument whose form is as follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It is similar to forks: but its extremities should be curved, so that the opening of each one is on a straight line, perpendicular to the other, thus care must be taken that it is made of iron or copper coated with aluminum.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is as follows:
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 Sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after cutting one almond, cut the other in the same shape of the incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then, after the incision, the sick person shall rinse his throat with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If blood flows, he shall rinse with water in which have been boiled the peels of pomegranates or leaves of myrtle and similar ones from boxwood, until the flow of blood stops; then care for him until he is cured.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes boils other than almonds grow in the throat.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Cut them accordingly as I said in the incision of two almonds equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 I myself have already been treated by a woman from a boil that was born in her throat, which drew towards the neck, with few senses, which almost closed her throat; and the woman breathed through a narrow nostril, and had already prohibited food and drink; and she was almost at death if she remained for one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 And the boil rose only so high that it had sent out two branches until they came out over two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 Therefore I rushed quickly and fixed a hook on one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it out, and a large part came out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then I cut off the part where I had grasped it from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I did what came out of the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook on the boil; then I cut off a part of it, and no more came out except a little blood; so the throat of the woman was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then received food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 I did not stop cutting from that ulcer for a long period of time: and the ulcer succeeded in its place which I was cutting, until it was extended too much and with it that (something).
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 I therefore cauterized the ulcer located at the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 Therefore it stood still after addition: then I walked away from there, and I did not know what God had done with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 Chapter on the incision of the ulcer in the throat.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When the catarrh descends to the throat, and an ulcer forms, and it is long: then it is called a perpendicular; and if it is thick and round at the lower part, it is then named as a boil.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is cured along with what I said in the division, and the cure does not work: and you see that the ulcer has become warm and has subsided, and is subtle: then it is necessary to cut it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And what is attached to it, round, and not long, and is bloody or dark red or black, and there is no sensation in it: then it is necessary to make an incision of it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For there is fear over the weak (one) in it.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore when you see it according to the manner which I said from whiteness, and its length: make the weak person sit before the sun; and press his tongue with the tool whose story preceded; then put a hook in the throat, and pull it downwards: and cut it with one of two tools which I said in the incision of the two salivary glands.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And it is necessary not to cut from it, unless what is added exceeds a natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you cut more from it, you will damage the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after the incision, use what was said about the incision of the two salivary glands: and cure it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 If the sick person is afraid of incision: then it is necessary that you use your skill in the cauterization of him without fear and dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 The method of cauterization is not otherwise, except with sharp water: and it is that you place the head of the sick one in your armpit.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the instrument which we said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take water which I told you in the chapter on cauterization and make a not-extinguished ladle with it, and do not make it thick or thin, and fill this instrument's hollow with it, whose shape is as follows: (Here, there would be a drawing of the tool)
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let the end where the medicine is placed have a hollow like that of a snail's shell.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 And place the instrument with the medicine on the wound itself: and let the sick one lie on his side, so that saliva runs out of his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing comes down from it to his throat, and it does not harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you from the first apply it to the wound in quantity of half an hour, until you see it already turned black and quieted the biting of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you want to receive a cup and cover it over the end of the radius, and pour the cup with the medicine, and insert the radius with the covered cup on top, until the cup adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do this many times, until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then let it go: for it will burn and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you need to apply medicine again, do so: and after cauterization wash the wound around it with a cup immersed in butter, and cleanse what is around it from the medicine: and wash it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And it shall be treated from outside with cupping glasses, and from inside with gargles, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 This method of treatment is healthier than incision and farther from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes the ulcer is also treated with a method more subtle than cautery and incision: it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take calaminthe, hyssop, origanum, rut, sseah, chamomile, abrotanum and similar herbs: gather all of them or some of them in a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, and boil them: the pot should be coated well with clay, and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which you arrange an instrument concave according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 Make it of silver or copper: and the end is inserted into the mouth of the sick one, until the vapor reaches the ulcer through a tube, until the ulcer is completely covered.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeat this over and over again, until it burns.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And beware not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 Usually, however, you add [something] to an abscess: it should not be done unless at the time of the decline of the heat of the abscess.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 If this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and fill its tip with the bark of an ox's horn: so that the bone of the sick one is not burned: because the bark of the ox's horn prevents the vapor from burning the bone: and this is part of good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 Chapter on removing thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often a bone or a fish spine adheres to the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore, it is necessary to remove what appears from among them that lies beneath the sight, after you press the tongue with an instrument near the sun, and it becomes clear to you that there is something in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And what is not apparent to you and hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make a man vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 Perhaps therefore it will come out attached matter through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or the sick person swallows a piece of nutmeg, or the root of lettuce, or a crumb of dry bread: or let him take a piece of dried sea sponge that is gentle: and tie it up with a thread, then let him swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When it reaches the place where there are thorns or bone, and it is pulled out, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If it does not come out as we said: then use an instrument made of lead in this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 Let it be thicker than the radius by a little, and at its end let there be a bent part, which he introduces into his throat easily: and let him himself hold his head raised up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let him avoid touching his epiglottis, so that he does not get a cough, and push with it the bone or thorn, or introduce it himself with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 But what the sick person introduces is better: because of his knowledge of the place of the attached matter: and let him push below or pull his hand with the instrument upwards, all of it according to the size that is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 Chapter on the extraction of Leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When the leech is cured with what I said in the division of cure with medicines, and it does not work: then examine in the throat of the sick person facing the sun, or after pressing his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook or with pointed forceps well placed.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with them (the instruments): then take a concave cannula and insert it into the throat of the sick one, up to near the throat; then insert into the concavity of the cannula hot iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this often: and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and wash his mouth with it, and swallow nothing from it; and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 For leeches it falls immediately when they feel water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If it does not come out with what I have said, then fumigate the sick one with bedbugs, or with ash with the instrument that I have mentioned for fumigating the ear.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this often, because it will fall by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot, in which there are live prunes with fire; and let the pot be covered with a cover, through whose middle there is an opening; and arrange the end of the instrument in it.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then throw the fumigation, and let the sick one place his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not come out, until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 For leeches fall immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation often.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 Let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salt and other things, and drink no water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Therefore it is necessary that it comes out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And this is the shape of the instrument with which a leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls on its face.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It resembles forceps, as you see; except that there is a bend in it which enters the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 The end of it is similar to the mouth of an owl, which is called a ciconia, in which there is roughness like a file. When it grasps something, it does not let go of it completely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 On the opening of abscesses and their cutting and treatment in general.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL (40).
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 The species of abscesses are many, according to their recollection, that is, one kind and one kind only in this book; and they are diverse in the perforation of them, and cutting of themselves from two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One kind is a type of abscess by itself, and that which it grasps from moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 And the second way is due to places, where it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring at the joints; and each of them has its own judgment according to the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And among the abscesses are those that should not be perforated unless after the maturation of pus in them and its completion; and there are those that must be perforated while they are raw and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 As abscesses which are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Because an abscess when it occurs near a joint and prolongs itself until it rots what is around its circumference, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; therefore it is the cause of a more pronounced contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or is an abscess near the main member; because if you delay the perforation of it until it matures, it will harm either him or through the main member itself.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus; therefore perforate it immaturely. And it is not necessary to perforate a raw abscess, not fully digested, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not rot deeply and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula or remain in its end which cannot heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 It is necessary that you know the hour of perforation of the abscess, which has matured according to completion; and it is at the sedation of pain, the recession of fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuity of the head of the abscess; and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess and of greater protrusion; and the perforation shall proceed along the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of hands and feet, shoulders, necks, tendons, nerves, arteries, and ultimately in all places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those which reflect, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 When the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to wait for the perforation of its digestion, as we said according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged and there are many filths and putrefaction, and possibly its edges harden and its depth increases.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body when necessary; or according to that which the member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation to small abscesses and a large perforation to large abscesses; or many cuts according to the similarity of the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And among abscesses, there are those in which the skin should be hollowed out; and it is cut when it has become like a cloth and reached the end that is already dead; as what happens often with buboes and swellings.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And among those, there are some which are cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And from them (the instruments) is one, when it is cut as in the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 As an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And among them (the instruments) are those for administering round and crescent-shaped sections, and similar ones for other sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 But that which has no head, such as superficial abscesses, should be punctured with a superficial lancing or only by incision.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 And when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, it should be punctured so that it does not burst and all the pus is drawn out at that hour; rather, draw out a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then wait for another day before operating on an abscess.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then draw something more from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do this repeatedly according to degree until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak or of poor strength, or a woman in pregnancy, or a small boy, or an old man decrepitus; for animal spirits are often resolved with the release of pus; and perhaps the weak one may die, and you will not benefit.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Be careful therefore, for this chapter requires great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your puncture of the abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound; and be mindful.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If the wound of the abscess is small or the incision is flat, then administer linen cloth or an old bandage.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if the abscess is large and there are many cracks of puncture, then it is necessary to insert linen into each crack until they meet.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if you have removed a piece of skin from an abscess or hollowed out the surrounding area, then it is necessary to fill it with an old bandage, as when fabric is woven or flax is combed without moisture; and bind it for three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then cut it open and care for that which is necessary with an ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 If there should be a flow of blood at the time of your operation, then give cold water and vinegar, after it has been soaked in cloths; and place this over the area of blood flow many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 If the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary that you give a regimen, treatment and powders, which I have described in many places of this our book, and from division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 If it is in winter time, and the place of the amputation is of many nerves; then it is necessary that you pour powder with wine and warm oil, and place them over the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy; then it is necessary that you place powders soaked in water, or oil, or wine and oil, and cool everything.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you remove the amputation, clean it, and administer for its treatment whatever suits it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of amputations universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the method of distinction, I have already said about every amputation, how is the way to its treatment separately chapter by chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 Chapter on the sectioning of amputations that occur in the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter XL (40).
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 Pustules small, of the nature of knots, occur on the head's skin, which are contained by sacs like they were pouches of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And their appearance is manyfold.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Some of them are fatty: some contain moisture similar to paste: some contain moisture like that of a scab and plaster: and those alike, and from them there are hard stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in the cutting of all [of them] and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as it does not cause opposition to an artery at their cutting.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the operation in cutting them is to try it with the instrument whose shape comes after these words, which is called "Intromissum," until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if it is what contains moisture, then cut it with a transverse surface-cut along its length in this manner: according to this shape.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin with the cut from line b to line g. For when the moisture is evacuated, then scrape off the cyst that contains this moisture, and do not leave anything inside of it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For often it returns if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and let it remain until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For that which remains from the cyst corrodes itself.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then repeatedly over the wound with Egyptian ointment second and third times, as often as needed, until you believe that nothing remains from the cyst; then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the pustule contains a fat knot: then cut it according to this shape, with a transverse cross-cut; and thrust needles between the folds of the cut, and scrape off all of it from every side: and strive in extracting the skin that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 If however an artery opposes (you), then do what I shall tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And similarly do in cauterization (if it is a stone), by cutting and the same cure, as we have said before.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 Cutting over a stone-like aposteme is easier; because it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 Sometimes there are some of these apostemes in the head in certain men, with which there is no moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 This is because I have cut over an aposteme on an old woman's head and found the aposteme to be as hard and solid as a stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if anyone struck it with force, he injured himself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 In other cases of apostemic occurrences in the head, with the exception of these specific apostemes that occur in children's heads and at the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Or make a perforation of theirs always from the lower part of it, so that the flow of pus is directed towards the lower areas.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then care for these with what fits them in terms of cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Section on Straphules (boils) in the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These abscesses often occur in the neck, under the buttocks, and in the groins; and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 On the abscesses that occur on the neck, there is one, and many; they are generated from opposite sides; and every boil from them is within its own layer, as it is with knots and abscesses of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 The types of these boils are numerous.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For from them are the stone-like ones; and from them there are those containing moisture; and from them are the malicious ones, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 In the good disposition of that boil which you see in touch, whose evident is near to the skin color, and moves towards every part, and is not attached with the neck muscles, nor with the groin, nor with the artery, nor is deep: it should be cut off by superficial section from above to lower part of the body along the line, b. to line, g., and scrape it from all sides; and stretch two layers of skin with a knife or with several knives if needed, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and draw it out gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it is on caution, that no vein or nerve should be cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 Let the knife not be very sharp; so that your hand should not hurt with the incision, or disturb the sick one, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If you cut a vein or an artery, it prohibits you from operation, then place in the wound linen soaked with powder that removes blood, and tighten the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound softens; or it begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 The blood is to be cut through the skin, therefore return to your operation until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Next, ask with your index finger if there remains anything of the straws (stitches) small: therefore cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If there is in the root of the stitch a large vein, then it is necessary not to cut that stitch from its root: rather tie it with a strong double thread and leave it until it falls by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with an old patch that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then take care of yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the stitch is cut entirely, then gather together the edges of the wound and sew it up immediately after you see that there remains no superfluity.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 If, however, you see that there remains superfluity due to the size of the stitch, then it is necessary to stretch out to cut its root and pull it out: and apply the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And what contains humidities from the stitches, pierce it with a superficial puncture to make its place appear to you: and place the puncture below that which follows lower in the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply linen with ointment after the puncture and similar things to burn what remains from corruption until you see that the wound is clean: then take care of yourself with a more potent ointment for flesh until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 Section on Epiglottis after amputation within the throat occurring.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients said this section on the Epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: this is their writing.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 In those with synanchias, it is necessary to be cautious about section of the Epiglottis: as no help is provided by that; because all veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 In those who have a hot boil in the mouth, throat or both amygdalae, when there is no illness in the canal, it is necessary to use section of the Epiglottis to avoid ruin which happens through strangulation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we want to cut the Epiglottis, it should be done under three or four circles of the Epiglottis with a small section along its width, in that which is between two circles by quantity; this should be a section in sifac, not cartilage; and indeed this place is suitable for cutting because it lacks flesh and blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the physician is afraid, then it is necessary that he stretches the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then he shall incise the skin until he reaches the canal; be cautious of blood vessels, if he sees any from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then he shall cut the sifac as we have said; it is indicated by the phlegm that comes out from there, with what is burst and separation of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And leave an open wound for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 When the hour comes when strangulation is feared, gather two lips of the wound skin, and the skin itself alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 The sum of the speech that I have related is not exposure unless they see that one of these boils has already choked the throat of a weak person; and he has risen up sickly near to death, and wishes to cut his breathing; they go to cut the Epiglottis so that the weak one may breathe over the place of the wound with some kind of breathing, and be saved from death; and for this reason they have commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, which lasts three days or so itself; then therefore they have commanded to sew up the wound and take care of it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And what I have seen with my own eyes is that a maidservant received a knife and sent it into her own throat and cut a part of the trachea of the lungs.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was summoned to treat her, and I found her gasping, as is the gasp of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 So I examined the wound, and I found that blood had come out from the wound in a small amount.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 Therefore, I suspected that she had not severed an artery nor vein; and a wind was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I therefore approached the wound and cured it until it healed; and nothing happened to the maidservant except a cough; and she returned after days to a better condition of her health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Therefore, from this I say that there is no fear in the tracheotomy (section of Epiglottis).
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 Chapter on the tracheotomy (section) of a hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This called hernia of the throat is a large aposteme (abscess), according to the color of the body; and it occurs more in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 And it is according to two modes: for it is natural, or it is accidental (acquired).
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 In the natural one, there is no inborn defect.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The accidental one is according to two modes: of which one is similar to fatty nodes (nodules).\]   Et hic nullo modo debet procedi ad operationem, nisi sit necessarium; et illud debet operari a magistro, qui hab
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the other mode is similar to an abscess caused by nodulation of an artery.\[ Et hic nullo modo debet procedi ad operationem, nisi sit necessarium; et illud debet operari a mag
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And there is fear in this one, and it should not be proceeded with operation unless necessary; and if it must be operated upon, it should be operated on by a master who has\[ Et hic nullo modo debet procedi ad operationem, nisi sit necessarium; et illud debet operari a mag\] skill in inserting (instruments).
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find the same sort of fatty lump and it is not suspended with any vein: then cut it off, as knots are cut off; and draw it out along with what it contains from the chest, if it is in the chest: and if not, then examine all around it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Care for the place with whatever is necessary for healing, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 Chapter on incision regarding lumps (knots).
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many types of lumps (knots), and I have already said all their species in the division; and it is necessary that I here explain the difference between a knot and an exitration (excision) when there is doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 Therefore, when the exitration (excision) is accompanied by heat and fever and intense pains until the boiling of superfluity subsides and the rotting is complete: then the fever and the heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 When the knot is not accompanied by heat, fever or pains and contains them in a chest (cavity) which is its proper sac: it is closed like a chickpea, and made like a gourd (melon), and larger or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And they are according to two species: either fatty: or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 The colors of the moisture (humidity) are many, as I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you approach the healing of a knot, you should examine it first with an instrument called "Intromissum", according to its form which will come in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 The method of examination of abscesses and all knots is to take this instrument, and insert it into the moistest place which you find in the abscess: and you shall turn your fingers gradually with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then, your last hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Extract (it), and observe what comes out with its trace.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If (it) comes out running moisture, whatever its color is: then cut it with a superficial incision, according to what I said about other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if no running moisture comes out in the trace of (the foreign body), then you know that it is fat: then cut over it with a section having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I taught you: and hang it up with tweezers, and strip off the skin from all sides easily: and keep a pot on it if possible, in order to extract it along with the knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If it breaks during the operation from the pot and cannot be extracted whole, then extract it piecemeal until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 For if something remains of it, little or much, the knot returns most of all.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If it overpowers you, and something remains of it: then fill the wound at your completion with certain corrosive powders: and stitch up the wound, and put on top of it what sits on the abscess, hot, and take care of it with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If therefore the knot is large, then separate its two lips, and take care of it with that which makes it grow together.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 If however it is a pulsating vein or not pulsating to you: then flee, and fill the place with boiled pitch, and leave it tightly sealed for two days or three, until the wound rots, and the boiling of blood subsides: then return to cut what remains of the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 Exterior instruments for cutting and perforating.
Caput XLVI.	 De usu fori in sectionibus et perforationibus.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 Of the forms of instruments introduced, there are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 For one is great, and one is medium, and one is small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Let them be made from iron of square tips well-balanced, so that they enter smoothly into the wound.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these are the forms of the experienced ones, and it is called perforation; and one of them is named bery, that is, piercing; and there are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 Amongst them there is a large one, a middle one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They converge so that they may be incised through abscesses, boils, fistulas, and buboes because they are among bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And some are made round, smooth, blunt, like the large needle that is set in handles, either from citrine or brass, iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 Those which are made of citrine are better.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 They are also made of black lead, which converge so that they may be used to probe fistulas, the concavity of which serves as reflection, so that they reflect with their smoothness along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 And again, there are three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because amongst them there are long ones, medium ones, and short ones according to the size of the fistula and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 Forma of vaginas, and there are many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because amongst them there are simple ones, that is, those which have a single curve; and there are three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And amongst them there are blind vaginas; and there are three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And amongst them there are vaginas with two curves; and there are three kinds: and amongst them there are vaginas with three curves; and there are three kinds: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 And these are the forms of scalpels with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped; and there are three kinds because amongst them there is a large one, a middle one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 The extremities for making a section are sharp, the other extremities are not sharp: they are not placed thus unless to provide help during excoriation of Nodules because of fear of incision of vein or nerve, and so that the sick one may be healed by it, and find some tranquility briefly as in burning which is found during excoriation of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are Magdalenas (or Magdalene cakes), and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of copper and resemble a thermometer, with a hidden spatula-like hole at one end; it runs through to the inside or outside as desired, as you can see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The shape of spatulas hidden among the fingers during incision of an abscess; the sick do not feel these; they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The forms of vein-tied bandages for cutting blood flow; they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 Make them of copper or citron, round, slightly long, as you can see; they should be fine.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 And it is necessary that these vein-tied bandage forms be large and small with you; so that you can cut blood with them quickly when there is need, and then when medicine is not present with you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 However, do not use them for cutting blood in any part of the body, nor use them except in fleshy parts; such as thighs, hips, arms, breasts, stomach, groin, and similar places, from fleshy areas, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes they are made into small instruments similar to the covers of fists, according to their form; with which blood is cut when it flows from the place of phlebotomy or incision of vein or artery; and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 On the treatment of human breasts resembling those of women.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes the breasts of some men swell during sleep (that is, when they begin to dream) until they resemble those of women; and they remain foul smelling afterwards.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Whoever abhors this (condition), it is necessary that he cuts the breasts with a lunar incision according to this form along the line, 'b' to the line, 'g'. Then scrape off all the fatness.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Then fill the wound with a ointment of resin.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then join two lips of the wound with stitches, and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the breast, however, droops downwards and becomes soft due to its size, as happens with women; then it is necessary that it be opened in two lateral incisions on both upper sides, each similar to the shape of the moon, one contained within the other at their ends so that the larger line contains the smaller one, according to this form from line 'b' to line 'g'. Afterwards scrape off the skin that is between the two lips and remove the fatness, and administer what I have said about stitching and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If the incision is not complete as required for you to make it, either due to the restlessness of the patient or due to bleeding; then fill the wound with a cauterized substance submerged in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains from the fatness.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 Chapter on the perforation of a boil that occurs under an armpit.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These ulcers that occur under the titillico, are of the species of hard worms, which contain cysts, and among them are those containing moistures.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Among those containing moistures, it is necessary that they be cut with a lunar section according to this form, from line b to line g. When everything within the ulcer is evacuated through pus, then fill it up with an old cloth and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the cloth, and treat it with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the ulcer is of the species of hard worms resembling knots, then cut it across, as we said in the section on cutting off worms equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If the wound extends so as to discharge pus, then administer cautery to it, according to what we said in that which was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 [Paragraph on the sectioning of ulcers due to an artery or vein.]
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery is torn and the skin above it hardens, there often occurs an ulcer; similarly, the same occurs with veins so that an ulcer and swelling occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which it is recognized that an ulcer and swelling are due to an artery or vein, are: because when an ulcer is due to an artery, it is long and gathered in the depth of the body; and when you press the ulcer with your fingers, it feels as if there is a grinding sensation.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And that which is due to a vein, is round and apparent on the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And cutting into this ulcer is a mistake, and particularly when it is under the shoulders, groins, neck, and in many parts of the body; and it is very great.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 It is necessary therefore that his care with iron should be avoided, and what is also from them (the iron tools) at the extremities, or at the head, it is necessary to avoid.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Over that which is from them due to swelling of the artery opening, find in the skin incision along its length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the incision with scissors, afterwards the artery: and release it from the tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert beneath it the awl and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread at two places, according to what I taught you regarding the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then prick the place which is between two ligaments with a lancet until all blood comes out, and dissolve the abscess.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off: afterwards treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If it is an abscess due to a vein cut, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what is possible from the abscess with skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert the awl beneath the place that you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it until you pull it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then tie the abscess with a good ligament: according to what I said to you regarding ligating a vein, from two parts with double ends of thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 If you fear that the thread may be pulled out, then insert another awl with another thread beneath the entire abscess near the incision: press and tie your threads at four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the abscess in the middle of it until when it comes out what is in it: then cut off excess skin and let go of that which was tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place on top of the smallpox blister that you have submerged in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Administer the treatment which is made with linen cloths and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 On paralysis that occurs due to twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	 Head L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As an aposteme occurs in arteries and veins, so does it occur in nerves; this happens to them due to a blow or excessive labor, or similar causes; and they mainly happen in places of joints, heels, and in any place where the connections are moved; and this aposteme is severe.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 It resembles its color to the rest of the body and is found in many forms without pain; and when it is tightened with violence, it feels weak, like in a state of numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And the aposteme is not gathered deep within the body, but it is under the skin; and it moves to all parts, and does not reach forward or backward.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 Therefore, what is found in joints should not be pierced with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Perhaps it will cause a contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 In the one that is found on the head or forehead, puncture the skin with a lancet.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If the aposteme is small, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If it is large, then hang it up with a hook and pare it; afterwards remove it, and sew the wound with suture; and treat it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 On incision of an aposteme that occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	 Head LII.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 Occasionally, certain men have recurring boils in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, which are called "Fungalia," due to their similarity with mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Their root is subtle, and the head of them is thick, and they have turned-over lips on them.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And from it there is a small one: and from it there is what can be magnified greatly.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 I myself have seen a man whose belly had two boils, which were more like mushrooms than other things: there was no difference between them; they were white, with thin roots, and their lips were turned-over, and they burst, and moisture always flowed out of them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I then cut them, and found that one weighed about X and VIII ounces, and the other about VI ounces. The operation for cutting them is this: if the patient is weak and the boil is white, moist, with a thin root, then cut it with a wide spatula, and have cautery ready in your presence.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 For often blood is expelled at the cutting of it: so beware if you are overcome by blood, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see a weak, fearful and timid person afraid of cutting with iron, then take a well-made silk thread, and bind it with it: its method is the one I have said, and let him go for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add to the binding of the silk thread.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore do not cease to bind the lead thread as often as it presses on the boil until it is cut off and falls out without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 If the boil is large at the root, then there is a fear and terror in cutting it, especially since it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 It is possible to cut it in half.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then cure it, until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And beware of cutting what is black and has few senses, with a foul appearance; for it is a cancerous aposteme, and I will pay (for) this when reminded of Cancer afterwards.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 Chapter on the treatment of the protrusion of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 A protrusion of the umbilicus arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 It arises either from fistulas (sifac) above the abdomen and out comes the althub or the intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 It arises either from blood flowing from a vein, or from an artery, as mentioned before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 It arises from a constriction of wind there (in the navel area).
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 But if it is due to a fistula (sifac), and the passage of pus: then its colour is like that of an abscess; it is filled with pus without pain; and its position appears different.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the passage of the intestine: then its position, as previously mentioned, is of a much more pronounced difference.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 When you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns and perhaps there is a sound; and it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath, and there is much pain.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 But if it is due to moisture: then it is soft; when you press it with your hand, it does not disappear, nor can it be constricted, nor does it increase in size.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood: then with these signs (inflammation and swelling) the abscess appears black at the navel.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is due to fleshy matter: then the abscess is large, hard and solid, and its size increases by a single degree.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 If it is due to wind: then when touched, it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the operation in this case is to examine whether the protrusion of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or wind: then it is necessary to forbid treatment of it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For in this case there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke of abscesses due to an artery or vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is due to an intestine or hernia: then it is necessary that you instruct the patient, so that he holds his breath and stands still, extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then make the signs with encaustic around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Then instruct him to lie down on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then surround with a broad spatula around the navel on the place you marked with encaustic.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Then extend the middle of the incision upward with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then tie him up around the navel with strong thread or silk cord: and let the knot of the ligature be alexandrine.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open the extended incision above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If you then find it already captured by the ligature: then extract the hernia, and introduce your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen: and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 If however, it is an artery or vein opposite to you: then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 Then take two needles and insert two strong threads into them: and insert two needles into the circle you made around the tumor in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then string the tumor in four places on the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave room, until the extended flesh rots away by itself: or cut it when it becomes tender and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with what is necessary from ointments until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is from a sore in him, or from moisture: then it is necessary to hollow out the tumor, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And draw out the blood, or moisture, that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then take care of him with whatever solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 [Title: On the Treatment of Cancer]
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have already said about the species of Cancer in division, and the way to treat it with medicines; and beware when treating it with iron, not to ulcerate it; we have said that Cancer is generated in the matrix, and cautery should be avoided in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 The ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated; such as Cancer which is in the breast or hip and similar limbs, to extract the entire thing of it; particularly when it is beginning small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 When however it becomes old, and is large, it should not be approached [for removal].
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I myself was unable to cure anyone from it; nor have I ever seen anyone else who has reached that point.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is to precede [the patient] and dissolve the weak from black choler several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then, if you find a phlebotomy with a clear overfilling.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the patient with a preparation, in which it is located during the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then throw hooks that fit [the cancer] into Cancer.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then hollow out Cancer from every part with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and let the blood run out, and do not cut it quickly, but rather press out the places and remove all the coarse blood by hand or as possible there with instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If however a flow of coarse blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you; then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 [Section on the care of hydrophysis.]
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV. [44]
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We now speak of the classification of hydropic conditions, and how water accumulates; and the signs of every type, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 That which is treated with iron, is only the scrofulous type; it should not be treated with iron for the tympanic condition; nor deeply for the hypersarcous condition, for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you have been treated for this hydropic condition of the tympanic type with medicines and the treatment has not helped, then consider it.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 For if weakness has already come to the sick person or there is another illness besides hydropic condition, such as cough or loose bowels, and similar ones, then beware not to treat it with iron, for that is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 If however you see the sick person with excessive strength and no other illness besides hydropic condition; and if he is not a child or an old man, then there is room for operation in him. You raise the sick person standing between your hands, and the attendant presses out his belly with his hand to force water down towards the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a splint with thorns, in this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 Let it be made of two sharp parts, long, and with pointed ends like a splint.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, let there be something short within it, so that it does not penetrate as far during the operation to the intestine and injure it.
Deinde considera.	 Then consider it.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if the hydropic condition is generated from the intestines, then it should be extended by cutting with a measurement of three fingers below the navel towards the lower parts above the breastbone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 But if the hydropic condition is due to liver disease, then your incision should be on the left side, three fingers below the navel.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 If its generation is due to the spleen, then make a section on the right side: and it is not necessary that there should also be a section on the side toward which the sick person will lie, so as not to run superfluities to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then, perforate the entire skin with an instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert into that incision and elevate your hand with a spatula beneath the skin, as if you are scraping it; and let the quantity that is scraped off be about the size of a nail or slightly more.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then pierce the spatula until the spatula reaches an empty place: and that is the location of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then remove it (the sponge), and insert into the opening an instrument with this shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver or copper or brass, polished; at its lower part there is a small hole, and on the sides there are three holes, two on one side and one on the other; and its end is cut like the end of a reed, as you see; at its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches water, then it (the water) immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water an amount equal to a half hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 Since if you evacuate more than is necessary from it, perhaps the sick person will die of a resolution of his animal spirits; or an approaching syncope occurs which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 But evacuate from it according to its potency and according to what the signs of the sick person's condition indicate to you by the force of his pulse and by the quality of his humors.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 Because it (the water) is retained immediately because of the skin which holds the hole that is on the sponge; about which I told you to pierce it in this way.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then on the second day, if you see the patient can bear it: extract also a small amount from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Carry it out for some days without fear, and be careful to avoid error until there remains in the water only a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If you fear the patient, and let out a large amount from the water: then take care of him with warm sand, much sweating in the bath and sun, and wait for his thirst: and take care of him with very dry medicines, until he is cured: and cauterize over the stomach, spleen, and liver, after the extraction of the water: as I told you in what went before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 On the care of infants who are born in places where their urinary passages have not been pierced.
Caput LV.	 Chapter 50.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When someone from among the infants emerges from his mother's womb, and his head is not pierced, or the opening is narrowed, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, assistance must be given to the piercing of it immediately upon birth, with a very subtle spatula, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a thin nail of lead into the opening and bind it; hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When therefore he wishes to emit urine, remove it (the lead), and mix (it with something).
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then return him (to his mother).
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine flowing over the place will not allow him to be closed off.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 He who has a narrow opening is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those in whom there is an opening in the wrong place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 Because from those who are born, the opening is at the end of the spinal column; therefore, he cannot mix at the front until he raises the spine with his own hand to higher parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 There is no generation for him, because semen cannot reach the mother according to rightness; and it is a very foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the method of treatment in this case is that the sick person should lie on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend the head of his spine with your left hand using a strong extension, and cut the head of the spinal column from its place at the tip, with a sharp knife or pointed spatula; as is the incision of a reed, or like a radish so that its middle comes similar to the head of the spine: and that the opening falls in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And be careful during your treatment lest you have a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 Many times that happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Apply pressure to the wound when he is cutting blood, and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 On Albather that occurs in the prepuce and head of the foreskin, and corruption, blackening, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 Many times these Albathers occur in the penis, and it is an eminence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from this one is malignant, and one is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Do not let the non-malignant one hang with a thin hook, and cut it off until you clean it entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then put on top of it a warm pad soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it afterwards with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If the Albather is malignant and of a foul color, then it is necessary to apply cautery after its incision and its removal.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 But if the Albather is within the foreskin that has not been circumcised, and a part of it is inside the foreskin, and a part outside: then remove the Albather that is inside first, until it consolidates, and then take care of it externally; since when you treat it together, the foreskin will not heal unless it breaks open.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And now they also occur in the testicles, and blackening and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you hollow out everything that has already blackened, and what wants to rot, or is already rotten.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then line it over with honey that has been beaten up with flour of walnuts and sieved grains of various plants.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 But if bleeding occurs, then apply cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this shape.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 The cautery is beneficial for two purposes at once, namely for the flow of blood, and for a wound when it is damaged.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head of the probe is corroded and completely destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a cannula made of lead into the penis's meat, so that the weak one mixes on top of it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 However, in the adhesion of the prepuce with the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur except in one whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it: and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound, or an abscess: therefore, it is necessary to remove the adhesion with the Spatulum obtuse until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is released from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to distinguish it accurately, then it is necessary to remove something from the head of the penis, and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 Because the prepuce, when it is subtle, may be perforated quickly due to its subtlety.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been made in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is cured with wick alcohol until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 Chapter on the cleansing of infants and the treatment of errors that may occur to them.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a solution to continuity, like other wounds: but since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is specifically for boys, it is necessary that we mark the better procedure, and the lighter way leading to health in it.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore, I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and there is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 I have found a larger part of artificers and phlebotomists using purification, circumcising with scissors and forceps; they use bandages, tie with thread, and make incisions with the nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 I have already proved all these methods, and I did not find a better purification with forceps, nor bandaging with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Since in circumcising with scissors, the skin is often missed.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Since the foreskin has two layers of skin: perhaps it cuts the upper one and damages the lower one; therefore, it is necessary to make an incision for the other, and pain will result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And with the purification that is done by the thumb, that is to say the finger, which tailors use, it does not cut off the end of the male member: since perhaps it enters into its orifice.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 However, in circumcising with the nail, perhaps iron goes in and corrupts your operation; and indeed the skin of a child is short by nature, and often such cases occur that do not require purification; and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 Purification with forceps and bandaging with thread has proven to be good for me; because scissors are proportionate to the incision; therefore, the sharpness that is on top is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 When you press your hand, therefore, the two sharpnesses are proportionate, and they incise according to one operation in one time; and a compression is made with a similar shape, containing the skin of the penis from all sides, with which no error occurs at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 And the method of your operation is that you should make the boy who understands a little more, whom you do not do unless you tie thread on his penis only; and you release him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him rejoice and be happy as much as possible for you from that which he receives his intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then place him standing before your prepared height, and he should not be seated: and conceal the scissors in your sleeve or underfoot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand into his member and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the cudgel comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then clean it yourself from that which adheres to it due to dirt.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then bind the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Afterwards, bind a little lower with a second ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold it with your index finger and thumb, and press well the place of the lower ligature, and cut between two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then peel off the skin quickly upwards and extract the head of the cudgel.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood run out slowly (for it is better) and place ashes on top of it; and above the ashes put a cloth in which the boiled calf's lung has been spread out and crushed with fresh rose oil: and let him lie on that until another day; and care for him with the rest of the treatment, until he is cured.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The form of the scissors for cleaning is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 Let there be two sharp points at the ends, and let them be bent inward so that the nail does not come out on them: and let the length of the two sharp edges be equal to the length of two handles evenly.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 But if an error falls in cleaning, it is because perhaps the entire inner skin escapes or part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to stretch it with your nail from your hour before the location is cut, and cut it evenly.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a tweezers and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 If it lasts for more than three days and remains inflated under the buttock, this is an abscess; then leave it alone until the abscess becomes warm, peel it off easily, and cut it according to how you are prepared; be careful from the head of the vein.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 It will not harm him that.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Therefore treat that wound with what consolidates the ulcer from the powders which we have mentioned in the treatise on powders; and if it is cut beyond measure from the skin and goes upwards, it will not harm him even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore take care of that until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 Chapter on the extraction of retained worm in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by packing made from stone, frozen blood, pus, flesh born, and similar substances from those which we have mentioned in the section on treatments.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if urine is not relieved and you see that its retention is due to a stone already present in the neck of the bladder; then it is necessary that he be sick on his knees bended.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then place his feet on top of him and let him extend his stomach from the upper part of his back, and make him hold his breath as much as he can.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 Therefore, when the neck of the bladder is pressed towards the back; then the urine is relieved.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 And if it is not relieved with what has been said and the case is severe for the sick one; then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument called syringe, whose shape is S, made of silver, thin, soft, concave like a bird's feather cannula in its subtlety, long like the palm of one hand and a half: to which there should be a thin cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 The method of exit for the bladder stone is such that you take a doubled thread, tie it at its end with wool or cord, a good ligature: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if there is any excess from the wool, but insert forcefully into the cannula as with an alembic.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and albumen of egg: and make the patient sit on a chair, and rub the bladder and the stone with moist oils and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then insert the syringe into the urethra gently until it reaches the root of the stone.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then fold it double from the upper part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the syringe into it until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has reached a hollow place: and this is not done according to this order unless because the passage through which it goes is twisted.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then gradually extend the thread with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 For a bladder stone follows wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then draw it out and let the bladder stone pass through the urinary way: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do this until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 [Paragraph on the quality of cleansing the bladder with a clepsydra (water clock).]
Caput LIX.	 Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When a sore occurs in the bladder or blood congeals or suppurates in it and there is a desire to distill waters and medicines into it: then make use of an instrument called a clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It is closed, that is, sealed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And within it (the bone) are three holes, two from one side and one from the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And the concave place, in which is that which thrusts it (the bone), should be according to the quantity that it requires without addition, until when it is pulled along with something, it is attracted by humidities; and when it is pushed, with it is expelled to a distance: according to which it does the clepsydra, which throws up naphtha, that is, Greek fire in warfare of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 When you wish to throw out the humidities into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the humidity and pull with it that which pushes towards the upper parts, for the humidity is drawn into the depression of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then insert its end (the end of the clepsydra) into a rod, as we have said in a syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then push the humidity with it (the rod), for that humidity immediately reaches the bladder in such a way that the sick person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The shape of the clyster (clisterium) is subtle, with which the bladder is cleansed.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Make it out of silver or gold; its head should be higher like a syringe with a small cavity below it in which a cord can fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the bladder of a ram and put humidity into it with which you want to cleanse the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie her between two cavities with a strong ligature with double thread and warm up the humidity slightly over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then insert the end of the clyster into a rod, then press your hand on the bladder with the humidity in a suitable tightening until the sick person feels it, because that humidity has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If the bladder is not present to you, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle out of it, and pierce it completely from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert a thread into those holes as they are rolled up.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then gather the circle as a wallet is gathered: after you place in it what you wish from moist substances, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then bind it in an instrument: and make with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing it with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 Chapter on the Extraction of a Stone.
Caput LX.	 Chapter Sixty.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have already said about the types of stones, and their cure with medicines; and we distinguished between a stone generated in kidneys, and bladder, and its signs; and we explained that an operation is performed on the stone when it is in the hand or sectioned; and this stone specifically arises in the bladder; and that which is formed in a rod; and I am telling you this with clear explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder, happens most often to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And among its signs is that urine comes out of the bladder like water in its subtlety; and there appears in it white sand, and the sick man rubs his rod, and he labors with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then it stands up, and comes out with it together with the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And the healing of boys is easy until they reach fourteen years of age.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 And it is difficult for the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 However, it is moderate in young men, because it is between the two; and for that person whose stone is larger, healing is easier; and if small, the cure is difficult.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 Upon reaching the cure, it is first necessary to clean the sick person with an enema, which draws out all the feces that are in their intestines; for it sometimes prevents the discovery of a Stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then the sick person is to be taken with their feet and shaken and moved downwards; so that the Stone descends to the depth of the bladder or leaps out from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit between your hands, and his hands should be under his loins, so that the bladder becomes entirely tilted towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine him and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If you feel a Stone in a place, then immediately approach with cutting upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not come out upon your touch entirely, then it is necessary to press the thumb of the left hand against it if the sick person is a boy; or the middle finger if he is an adult male; and introduce it into his anus, and examine from the Stone, until it is under your finger; and gradually turn it towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press upon it with your finger and push it outwards against the place where you wish to make the incision; and command the attendant to press on the bladder with his hand, and command another attendant to lift the testicles of his right hand upwards; and let him remove the skin that is under the testicles in the part where the incision is to be made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert a probe cutting, whose shape is as follows.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find the place between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, on the side of the left hip; and make the incision upon the Stone, and your finger should be in the anus; and make the incision transverse, so that the incision is wide outside and narrow inside, according to the amount by which the exit of the Stone from it will not be greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 Perhaps a finger, which is within the anus and presses against the stone during surgery, comes out easily.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that from the stone are its angles and edges, wherefore its exit is difficult because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And it is soft, similar to a gland, and round; therefore, its exit will be easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 To him who has angles and edges, add the incision (or fissure).
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not come out thus, then it is necessary to fumigate (or cauterize) upon it; or to bind it properly with a string whose end is like the moon, which should be wrapped around the stone and not slip off: or to introduce an instrument under it that is sharp and curved at its tip.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If you cannot (reach) above it, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If something stops you from proceeding due to blood, cut it with a scissors.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 If the stone is more than one, then forcefully push the largest towards the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut upon it (or make an incision).
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Next, forcefully push the smallest one after it; and similarly do so if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, then ignorance is to cut above it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Because it happens to the weak that one of two things occurs, either he dies or there is a continuous discharge of urine; therefore, because the location does not consolidate at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 But administer its expulsion until it comes out; or fumigate (or cauterize) the fracture of it with forceps until you remove it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with thyme, aloe, and dragon's blood; bind it (or close it) and place upon it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water; to let an abscess heal warmly.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then turn the sick person over on his neck, and do not loosen the ligament until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you release (it), anoint the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 If a hot abscess or corrosive is added to the wound, and similar things: as if blood congeals in the bladder and urine is forbidden from it; and this is recognized by the exit of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its rotting.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then clean the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply to it everything that agrees with its healing until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And it is necessary during the entire healing time that you tie together both hips, and bind them, for the reason of the medicaments placed on the site.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and it is in the bladder and presses on it, and urine is forbidden from it; then care for it with what I told before until you reach cutting (surgery).
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For many times you are excused from surgery through this healing method, since I have now proven that (it works).
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And it is for you to receive the Perforatorium from iron-pointed (Perforator), whose shape is triangular at the end, sharp and fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take thread, and tie it to the rod under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the perforating iron into the rod with ease until the Perforator reaches the stone; and turn the Perforator with your hand in the same stone gradually; and you grind the perforation of it until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 Urine is immediately discharged.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand on the remaining part of the stone from the outside of the shaft.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 For it breaks up and is discharged with urine, and the ill person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If this treatment is not prepared for you for some reason that prevents it: then tie a string under the stone and another string above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut across the shaft above the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then extract it (the stone).
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Next loosen the bandage, and clean the frozen blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to tie a string under the stone unless to prevent it from returning to the bladder: and another string above, unless so that when the string is loosened after the stone's expulsion, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to lift the skin above when tying the upper string, so that it moves upwards towards the surface, and returns to its place and covers the wound as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 Chapter on the extraction of stones in women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 Stones are scarcely generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 If a stone happens to any of them (women), then the treatment is difficult and it is forbidden on account of many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One reason is that the woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And secondly, you cannot find a woman who will reveal herself to the doctor when she is chaste or married women.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 Thirdly, you cannot find a woman well skilled in this art, especially the operation with hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And fourthly, the distance from the location of the stone is great: therefore it requires a deep incision, and there is fear in this.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If necessity compels you to do so, then it is necessary for you to take a skilled woman as the doctor, and such women are scarcely found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 If [the stone] should be located privately, then seek a clean physician, subtle, and a present midwife well-learned in the matter of women, or a woman who knows this art partially: make her present, and especially instruct her to do everything that you command her concerning the examination over the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 Firstly, that she looks to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary for him to insert his finger into her womb and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If he finds it (the stone), let him grab it with his finger and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the weak place of the bladder and search for the stone, after she puts her left hand on the bladder and presses it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If he finds the stone, then it is necessary that he gently moves it from the bladder opening towards the lower parts with all his strength until it reaches the root of the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then he cuts across it (the stone) near the middle of the bladder at the root of the hip from whichever side he is prepared, and feels for the stone in that place: his finger should not be removed from the stone, grabbing it; and the cut should be small initially.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then insert the ray upon that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If he feels the stone, then he should enlarge the cut according to the amount proportional to the stone's exit.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that the shapes of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 For these (stones) may be small or large, smooth or rough, long or round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Know its shape so that it is signified to you about the stone in question.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood conquers you, then add to the place crushed pomegranate seeds and hold it for an hour until the blood is removed.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your operation until the stone passes out: and make sure you prepare yourself with the instruments, which I mentioned for the removal of a stone in men, to assist you in your procedure.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If the flow of blood overpowers you and you know that the expulsion of blood is from a cut artery: then place powder on the spot and tie it with suitable sutures; do not move it, and leave the stone alone, and do not remove it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps an unwell woman may die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When the sharpness of blood subsides after several days and the spot putrefies, then return to your operation until the stone passes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 Section on a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	 Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A watery hernia is not anything but an accumulation of moisture inside the albido sac, which is under the skin containing the testicle and egg: and it is called the albido sac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it is within its own panniculus, which nature has prepared for it near the egg, until it appears as if it is an egg; and this is another egg, and it is between the albido sac of the testicle, which we have said: and this does not often happen.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 And indeed the generation of this [watery hernia] is due to weakness that happens to testicles: therefore this matter flows into them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes it occurs from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 Or it has a color that is sloping towards citrinitas, or it is blood red, or feculent, black, or watery white: and this is what is more common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And the signs by which one knows where the accumulation of water is located are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 Because if it is in the albido sac as we have said, then it is a tumor round and slightly smaller than an egg's length; and the testicle does not appear because moisture keeps it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 If there is moisture within its own sheath (sac), then the boil is round with part of the eye, and therefore man fears it because it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 If there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the scrotum, then it falls under the sense (feeling or touch).
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 When the eye perceives the knowledge of the moisture's color, then to test the color of the moisture in a boil with an inserted square probe, whose shape precedes it.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 Therefore, according to what comes out in the footprint (impression) of the inserted probe, judge about that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When we come to the cure with iron, then it is necessary that you command the patient, if possible for him, to be bled and see his body full (swollen).
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then he lies on his back on a raised bed, and place many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then you sit on his left side, and command the servant to sit at his right side, who extends his stick to one of two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the scrotum.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, up to the groin: and make the incision according to the straight line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the scrotum covering: and scrape it off and observe it, or be careful not to separate it: and your scraping should be on the part that hangs more with the egg: and examine carefully with the scraping according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then pierce the scrotum full of water with a wide piercing, and drain out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with spatulas (unguis), and stretch the scrotum to the top, and do not touch the skin of the testicles enclosing it: and cut the scrotum as you can, either completely or in pieces, especially on its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	If you do not examine nor scrutinize, there is no certainty that water will not flow out in the incision.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 However, if an egg comes out externally from its skin at the hour of your operation: then when you complete the section of the sifac, return it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then gather two folds of the scrotal skin with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it as other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If you find a rotten egg due to other discoloration, then tie containers that are suspending, fearing blood flow.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then remove the testicle with the suspension and extract the egg; afterwards take care of it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 If however water is gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two branches; so cut the other part equally as you did with the other.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it appears to you that the operation should be one, then do it; afterwards remove the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 Insert a submerged wool in oil or rose oil; and place another wool that you have soaked in wine and oil on the outside and expand it over two testicles, and look for the intestine; and put double cloths above it and there are fleeces: and tie them above with a ligament having six knots.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then take two cloths, wash them, fill them with linen soaked in a dye, according to this likeness: and make the edges which are pressed by the loom, or wet wool; and join them together at the waist; and one edge should extend from the anus to the back, and the second should extend to the part of the neck; and two edges below on the thighs, and two other edges above on the groins; and bind them all together at the waist of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes artificially this ramie stalk is medicated with a cautery in place of a section with iron: and it is to receive the subtle cautery-knife and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is to be heated, according to what we have narrated: until when the sifac album containing water is revealed: then receive the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 The letter forms resemble Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then pierce it with that sifac, and let it be heated until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then spread the sifac with a hook, and burn off its coating with a fine cautery and cut it as much as possible for you until you remove all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And be careful not to let fire touch the egg.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this operation is safer and more distant from bleeding than the operation with section, and better.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If however this operation causes you difficulty during the hour of section or the hour of cautery, or an abscess, bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary that you treat what causes difficulty for you from that with the appropriate cure, according to what was mentioned earlier.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 If however the sick person is afraid and does not await this operation due to its horror: then administer piercing according to what I narrated there, and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When you are certain for yourself according to what was said about the meanings that this ramie stalk is watery: then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then pierce the abscess at its lower part with a large spatula: and place the piercing according to the length of the body, and let it be an open wound wide enough for water to flow out completely.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place a cloth over the wound and tie it, and let the rest of the water flow out: then treat the patient until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If there is opposition to the exit of water at the hour when you perforate it (the bladder), and this is not for any other reason than because a white membrane causes opposition in the wound opening, preventing the outflow of water: then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water from hydropic individuals is extracted, whose shape has been previously described: or add, during the operation on the wound, a little.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or approximately those.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 Since it has collected, then it is to be punctured in the same manner, and the patient shall pass through his illness days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 Treatise on the care of fleshy roots.
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that in the section on this fleshy root, there is danger of slipping into ruin in many positions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore it seems to me that its release is saved from that.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I am remembering the operation on it and the appearance of the incisions.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 Therefore I say that many incisions occur in bodies which are composed of testicles: and this happens due to many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or from an excess of sharp or acid fluid which flows towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the color of the incision is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found there; and it is a severe incision.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 And perhaps it is a stone-like incision, whose color is dark, and no sensation is felt there.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it occurs from the knotting of the arteries and swelling of them; as has already been remembered before: or from the swelling of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 What is caused by the swelling of the arteries can be recognized by the position of the incision, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 Do not touch him entirely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 What is done by the swelling of the veins, is not dispersed from it under pressure with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 Now it is possible that a cutting can be made on this type and on other flesh; and it is to cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then stretch the egg upward and take it out along with the white albumen; and free the suspensors from the bladder, and seal the bladder; and cut the suspensor after you have freed it from all parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If the egg is consolidated with those born-together fleshes, then it must be pulled and cut.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is an adhesion between something from the bladder or within it, then it must be released completely and cut with a circular incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 If there is a birth of flesh in the place of the adhesion that is behind, then it must be cut entirely and the egg must be taken out, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; afterwards take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 Chapter on the care of branches that are related to vines.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 A tumor is enrolled with a certain enrollment, similar to a bunch of grapes, when the testicles are softened; and it is difficult for movement, exercise, and walking on weak persons.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this disease, there is fear due to the recollection that preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 But we must say the operation according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore, I say that you must make the weak person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then pull down the suspender of the testicles.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, and with the instruments that are near to the rod: let another servant hold it, and stretch it with a forceful extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then cut with a broad, sharp, transverse incision directly into the vessels, until they are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then, remove all the fat from every side, as I have told you when extracting arteries in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then insert a needle with a double thread into them and tie it at the first places where vessels appear; and tie it again at the last of these.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut it in a straight midsection along the body's length and extract what has accumulated from foul, corrupted moistures.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then take care of the wound with treatment for other wounds from which pus is generated, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle fall off.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 For it is not bad in that way.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 But if vessels appear in all the vessels, then they must be extracted because of this testicle with the vessels: so as not to deprive it of nourishment due to the incision, and it rots or burns, and is no use with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 Chapter on the care of Intestinal Roots.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The outlet of this root is from an incision which occurs on the extended sigmoid colon in the inguinal part of the stomach.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Because the intestines descend through that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from the sigmoid colon or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 And these two types occur due to various causes: either from a blow, a jump, a shout, lifting a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And the mark, when it is from extension of sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It happens gradually over a long period of time and does not occur suddenly; it is an abscess deep in the direction of the extension; therefore, because sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And its sign is when it is from section of sifach, because it causes a sudden intense pain at the start; and it is an abscess different, appearing under the skin close by; and that is due to the outflow of intestine and its course towards exterior sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it comes out with the intestine called zirbum; and this is called an Intestinal Ramification, and zirbia; and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes it runs into the intestine with feces and is retained there; and that brings about the peril of the sick person; because it causes a bad pain, especially when it is compressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in treating the affliction of this disease with iron there is fear; therefore, one must be careful about the occurrence in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 And the method of operation is to order the sick person to push his intestine back with his hand towards the hollows of its own cavity if he obeys the command.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he lies down on his neck over your hands and elevate his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then stretch the skin that follows the skin to the upper part, and cut the entire skin of the testicles in length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then make two cauls on the lips of the incision according to what you need to open the incision with them; and the incision should be according to the quantity, so that it is possible for an egg to come out from there.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the sifach, and what is under the skin of the testicles until the white sifach appears hard from all sides; then insert your index finger into what follows the testicle, in that which is between the white sifach, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the sifach and the abscess, without adhesion to it that is in the back part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move your right hand towards the inner skin of the testicles, and as you do this, extend the albumen upward with your left hand, and lift out the egg with the albumen to the part of the incision. And command the servant to stretch out the egg upward. You solve the adherence which is behind complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 Ask your fingers if there is nothing there from the intestine rolled up in the hard albumen.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If you find something from that, then push it down towards the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take the probe, in which is a thick thread made of linen from ten threads, and insert it at the last albumen, that is, the membrane which follows the incision: namely, under the skin of the testicles. Then cut the ends which project from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then arrange some of them over others in the shape of a cross, and tie the thread we mentioned (the strong ligament under the skin of the testicles) to them until it cannot let any of the secretions which nourish them pass through to them, so that no hot abscess occurs there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place another ligature beyond the first ligature, at a distance from it less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligatures, release the thread which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity equal to the size of a finger, and cut the rest in a rounded manner and remove the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then cut at the lower part of the skin of the testicles with an incision from which blood and pus flow, as we said in what was mentioned before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply the thread soaked in oil and place it on the wound, and apply the ligature we mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes cauterize the hard albumen which we said before, after the incision of it, fearing from the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 Multotiens enim accidit illud. translates to "It happens often that this occurs." in English.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 "Let go of the ligament until it falls by itself." (in English)
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 "If the case does not proceed, then boil it with hot water; and place on top of it what I said until it falls." (in English)
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 "Then take care of the wound with the usual treatment for wounds, until it is healed." (in English)
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 "[A Case] On a Wound from a Bladder" (in English, title of the case
Caput LXVI.	 "Chapter LXVI" (in English)
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 "In this type of wound, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron." (in English)
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 "And the first [people] said that it happens as I mentioned in a wound from a bladder and a vein." (in English)
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 "That is, to tie vessels after the incision below easily; then cut in the middle, and then treat afterward with what opens it up, until the vessels fall off; and take care of the wound, as I said before, until it heals." (in English)
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 "[A Case] On a Rupture that occurs in the groins" (in English, title of the case)
Caput LXVII.	 "Chapter LXVII" (in English)
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 "When a rupture occurs in the groins, as I have said, and there is an empty place, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if it does descend, that is not enough, and it returns in all hours; but if it lasts for a time with this, a tear is added in the sifach [hernia], until the intestines descend into the sifach." (in English)
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 "And this occurs due to extension of the hernia, which is in the groins, as I have said." (in English)
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 "That is because the hernia extends; then it is softened and the place is stretched out, and it emerges." (in English)
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 And its treatment is with a cautery, as his previous narrative states.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And sometimes it is treated with iron, according to this method: and there is [a way] for the sick person to lie on his back upon your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then cut the place of the rupture and protrusion, with a cut across its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then tie the alsi-fak and whatever is beneath the skin until the white al-sifach appears, which is beneath the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take a probe and place it over the protruding part of the al-sifach and press it to the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then make two incisions on the extremity of the radius from the al-sifach and sew them together with a stitch; then remove the extremity of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 Do not incise the al-sifach at all, nor tear the ovum [yolk sac], nor anything else, as I have instructed you in treating intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then treat that with wound treatment.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 When you make stitches, clean it and heal the wound until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 The sisycon [certain type of plant fiber] contracts, and does not add to the protrusion of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And the cautery is better for this place, because it is closer to healing.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 Chapter on softening the scrotal skin.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, on account of which the meats between them are softened and its appearance becomes foul.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat it (the testicles), that he makes the sick man lie on his back and cuts off all the softened skin that is on top of the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then gather two lips together with stitching: and if you wish, or even more so, remove the excess of the softened skin by three or four stitches, and make a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then care for the healing of the remaining wounds until they are healed and the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	 [Title: On Castration.]
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 Know that castration is forbidden by our law: and therefore it would be appropriate for me not to remember it in this book of mine; and there is no need to remember it except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One reason is that it should be known by the physician when he is asked about it: and so that he knows the treatment for the one who suffers from it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And another method is that we often need castration of certain animals, for the benefit of our needs through it, such as sheep, hyracids, and cats, and similar ones from animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 Therefore, I say that castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by grinding.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by cutting and separation.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In that which is done by grinding, the way of the operation is: what we should do is make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and relax and hang down; then grind them with your hand until they resolve and no longer appear upon touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 In castration by cutting and separation, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then tie the sack, and cut above all the egg in one section, until when two eggs come out: then cut what is left after you have scoured each one, and do not leave anything on it beyond the thin skin, which is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than the one by grinding, since grinding possibly leaves something from the testicles, which causes the animal to desire coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 Chapter on the care of Hermaphrodite in two methods.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 Hermaphrodite from men is according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is that it appears in him in the space between the testicles or on the skin of the testicles, in which is located a figure resembling a female vulva with hairs; and sometimes urine flows out from the part that is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women, however, there is one species, and it is a female vulva on the mons pubis like small testicles of a man, projecting to the outside; of which one is like the priapus of a man, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And the treatment of three kinds, two from males, and one kind from females, is: because it is necessary that you make incisions in the added flesh, until the impression of them flees away.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then treat those wounds with the remedies used for other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 Furthermore, in the second kind of male, which originates from where urine comes out that is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment for it at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 Chapter on the incision of Tentiginis and the protruding flesh in women's wounds.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 A Tentiginis may be added beyond what is natural, until it becomes foul and ugly to look at; and sometimes it swells so much in certain women that it spreads like in men and reaches copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, you must hold the excess of Tentiginis with your hand or with a probe, and make an incision; not deep into the incision, especially at the root, so that there is no bleeding.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat the Tentiginis itself with the remedies used for wounds, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 The flesh that arises is the flesh that is born in the opening of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it comes out on the outside, similar to a tail; and therefore some call the condition 'caudated'.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, it must be cut like the Tentiginis is cut and treated until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 Chapter on the treatment of an abscess in a woman that has not burst open.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 An abscess in a woman that has not burst open or has a small opening is called Alratic.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And it may be either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 An abscess caused by a preceding illness is accidental; and it may be formed from added flesh, or from fat or pus; and it may occur in the deep parts of the womb, or on its sides, or above or below it; and it prevents copulation, conception, childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 And the knowledge of it is obtained through an obstetrician's examination, if the circumcision is apparent nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the circumcision is from a subtle sifach and is close to two lips: then pull it out, and tear it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And it should be placed on two lips (lips of the vulva).
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then stretch the two lips with force until the subtle sifach tears and the circumcision opens up.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take wool and moisten it with oil, and place it on the site; let the woman apply it every day to prevent the area from healing in another way.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 If the sifach is large and thick: then it should be cut off with a broad spatula or a leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If the circumcision is of flesh born, then suspend it with hooks and cut it; have medicines with you that stop blood flow without causing pain, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and onion juice mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a wide cannula made of lead to prevent the wound from healing quickly, hold it for several days; then apply linen cloth, then treat the rest of the healing process until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And sometimes a birth of flesh (of other creatures) occurs in the womb: therefore, they should be cut according to this method: if there is no cancerous abscess, do not make any contrast with iron at all, because it may cause harm.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 Chapter on the treatment of hemorrhoids, by Athehelil and Botheor for women.
Caput LXXIII.	 Head LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the vein's outlets, as long as much blood continuously runs from them.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 If hemorrhoids become chronic, they become piles; and I have already said about their species and their signs in the division of them, and here I will say what receives treatment from them and what does not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb and do not appear to the sense, then there is no treatment for it with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those which are on the opening of the womb above where the sense falls upon them, are those that can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore it is necessary to introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then stretch out the piles with forceps or rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then sprinkle powder over them near the flow of blood from one of the incisions without biting; such as alum, dragon's blood, sulfur and similar things.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then press his feet against the wall at the hour of one.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 After that, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, rind of pomegranates, and walnuts, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If the blood is cut off with it, that is good; and if not, make adhesive windbags and breasts, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool, immerse it in the juice of tarathith, or the juice of arnoglossum, or the juice of the branches of aalaulatus (that is, alanthe), Pontic wine and make it adhere to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When the abscess becomes quiet, then care for the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 Albarth is red and resembles the heads of a scallion (alhaasse), and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, it is necessary to excise what appears from it, as I said regarding the onion (thelil), equally; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 [Chapter] On the Perforation of the Extrusion that occurs in the Womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter LXXIIII.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 In the matrix (womb) various appearances of abscesses occur, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, adubelati, alekilati (herpes), fistulae, hemorrhoids, ragadiae, thelil, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And I myself have already said all these illnesses and their appearances, their signs, and their cures are divided. It is necessary that in this treatise I speak about the hot abscess in the matrix (womb) which occurs among the abscesses which gather pus, and you should know how to open it with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, one must consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 Then if the pain of the abscess at its onset is sharp with beating and burning and fever, and it appears red; if it lies upon the sensation, then do not puncture it; and cure it with what gives relief according to its maturation, until the acuity of the symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then one must make the woman sit on two seats with a gap between them and recline or lean against her back, and place her feet to the lower part of the belly; and let her hips be spread out, and put her arms under her knees and tie each arm with a bandage connecting them to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument for opening the matrix (womb) orifice.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 Its form comes to those that are pregnant afterwards.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And it is necessary when you are to administer this instrument that you form a point with the rod deep into the woman's matrix (womb); so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the matrix, and does not harm the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If the instrument is more than deep, then one must place powder (pulverized charcoal) on top of the depth of the matrix; so that the entry of the instrument is not to the full depth of the matrix; and one must place a weight (lead) which runs in the instrument from the upper side, and hold the instrument and rotate the worker (assistant) with the weight, until the depth of the matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When it appears to be excised and touched by hand, and is soft and yielding: then it is necessary that you cut it off at its base with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When pus is discharged, then it is necessary to place a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, which has some styptic property, on the wound; and then make an incision into the matrix deeply.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And place outside [the body], on the matrix and on the comb, a clean wool soaked in water in which bitter apples have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it should be treated with an appropriate ointment for two days until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And at times the matrix and the wound are cleaned so that it is cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of the lily has been boiled, or long aristolochia; then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound is hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron; rather, treat it as we have said for division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Book of Obstetrics: How to treat living embryos that have emerged abnormally.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter LXXX.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for an obstetrician to first know the shape of a normal delivery.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 From the signs of this, it is known that when you see a woman pressing downwards and she desires to smell the air, and urine is passed over her in childbirth, and she hastens the exit of the embryo: then know that this delivery is according to its natural shape, and the outlet is above the head and second outlet with it; or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press the abdomen of the woman so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 When it [the instrument] descends upon his head, it [the second one] also descends with it, and it is to be cleansed from those superfluities with good purification.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 Whoever is beyond this delivery is unnatural, inaudible.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 Because sometimes the fetus comes out with its feet first, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet or one hand: or the head comes out and one hand: or the intestines come out: and perhaps it turns over on its neck, and similar unnatural figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these matters and to guard against error and deception; and I am showing every figure of them, and how there is skill in it, and it will be indicated by that, and it will stand upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus comes out with its head in a natural delivery, and it becomes violent upon the woman, and the delivery is difficult for her, and you see its strength already weakened: then make her sit on a stool, or women hold her; and have her take deep breaths with fennel water boiled, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the midwife introduces a small spatula between her fingers, and grabs the second one with it, and cuts it with her nail until it runs out of moisture; and she presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 If it does not descend, then it is necessary to cleanse the woman with mucilage of fennel, with oil of sesame.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then command her after the cleansing to press down; and make her sneeze with pepper, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 The fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary to reduce them gently and gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If it does not obey at the entrance [of childbirth], then place the woman on a seat, and lift her feet upwards; then strike the seat upon the ground; and hold the woman, so that she does not fall during the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If the hands do not emerge and the fetus dies; then cut them off, and extract the remaining fetus; and bind its hand with cloth, and extract it equally; for it will come out by itself.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The emergence of the embryo is upon the feet of itself.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus emerges upon its feet, then it should be pushed upwards; then it should be slowly turned; afterwards, it should be delivered equally.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then, take one of his feet and stretch it out gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they [the legs] emerge up to the hips, then command her [the woman] to bear down and make her sneeze with a blow; for it will come out if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not come out as we have said, then draw the fetus back gradually until you place it in its natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For it will come out then with an easy delivery.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 If it is prevented from coming out as we have said; then take some mucilage of aloe, and oil of sesame, and dissolved gum; and grind it all together in a mortar with good blows; afterwards, apply the paste to the woman's vulva and below her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until the uterus descends [to its normal position].
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 When you see that the lower parts have become warm, then give her something to drink made of myrrh; and place it [the myrrh] beneath her.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When therefore the hour is one, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make her sneeze: and pinch her own nose and nostril: and press the lower part of the abdomen gently with compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 For the feces will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 Delivery on the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it comes out in this manner, then insert your hands gently.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman lies on her back with her head down and legs hanging: and she remains lying on the bed and folds her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press gently on her abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then take out what is under her feet from the bedding, until it is prepared below.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 If the fetus does not come out, then take hold of her feet and move them vigorously.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press gently on what is above the pubic bone until the fetus rises towards the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then insert your hands and guide the fetus gently: and command the woman to press until the fetus is born.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 Delivery of the fetus, hanging sideways from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 Insert your hand to reduce [the size].
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 If it cannot be reduced, then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 If she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and strike her legs with a violent blow.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then apply the ointment you have prepared from gums [of certain trees].
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 If she gives birth, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then strive to reduce the hand [or arm] and guide the fetus according to its natural shape: make her sneeze and command her to press until it is born.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The outcome of the fetus is above its neck, with open hands, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The midwife must hold the baby's hand, then gradually turn it, and adjust it easily.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it is adjusted, then place it over the mouth we previously mentioned with oil and mucilage.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then command him to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and command her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then command her to compress (the birth canal), and cause her to sneeze with a strong blow.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The prepared baby comes out on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When the second child descends into the mother's birth canal in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail until it is expelled due to moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If the baby hangs over the face and its neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the baby inside until you place it as required; and command the woman to compress herself several times, for it will come out easily.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 The birth of twins or multiple babies.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 Know that twins often give birth; and sometimes they give birth to three, and even four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However, that is unusual and rarely occurs.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 Five is indeed an abnormal thing, and they do not live long; it contains them, even though there are many afterbirths; and they are separated by the cord, distinguishing between them tied at the navel of each one.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 Sometimes they come out like a single baby does naturally and easily; and sometimes they come out in an unnatural way as we have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them are difficult during childbirth and reach what we said in unnatural figures, then treat them as we have described: it should be subtle and do what is done with ease and slowness, and adapt according to every figure with what is prepared for him guided by his intellect towards recovery.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	¶ Remember that which is formed in the womb from embryos and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it is already verified by me, that a woman, while giving birth, has emitted seven, and another fifteen, all of them formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 What was done through the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, all of this should be in the knowledge of Obstetrics.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 Perhaps it will reach a similar one: oppose to it, as necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	¶ On the extraction of the dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you care for a dead fetus with what was said in the division of medication and it does not leave, and you will be forced to use an operation with hand, then it is necessary that you consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If the woman is of good health and has no accident from which her death is feared: then it is necessary that the woman lies down on the bed, on her back, and her head should be inclined lower, and her legs raised: and the assistant should hold her from two sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body does not be pulled during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then, the womb is moistened with oils rich in moisture (humid oils) with almond mucilage and fenugreek seeds, and linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the midwife shall insert her hand along with those oils and mucilages; then she shall introduce it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then let her seek a place where to fix hooks on the fetus, and locations suitable for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Then consider whether the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix hooks into its eyes, or at its neck, or mouth, or palate, or under its beard, or at its armpit, or near the ribs, and below the hips.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If it is a descent upon its feet, then fix hooks in the chest, and at the middle of the ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary that she holds the hook with her right hand; and let her place a loop on it between the fingers of her left hand; and introduce it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in one of those locations which we mentioned, until she arrives at the emptiness.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then fix another hook, or a third one if necessary, on the opposite side: so that the contraction may be equal and not incline to any side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then it shall be extended with an equal extension, and the extension should not be straight only, but rather moved to all sides, so that the passage may be alleviated: just as it is done with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And let there be softened at that place the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If a part is held back from it, then the midwife should insert some fingers with oil on that side, to turn what is being held back along with them.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If a part of the fetus is coming out, then the hooks shall be changed to another higher location; do this until the entire fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If a hand or another part is coming out and it cannot be returned because of its constriction; then let a cloth be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then extract it completely until it emerges wholly, cut it either at the joint of the foot or at the elbow; and so it must be done in one hand, and in both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If the head of the fetus is large or it encounters dislocation during birth, or water has accumulated around its head; then one must introduce a spiny spatula between the fingers and crush the head with it, and extract the water, or rupture it with the instrument called Almisdac; whose form comes among the forms of other instruments in the chapter following this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Likewise, if the fetus is of large head nature, then one must make a cut with scissors (algengematu); or extract it with forceps (misdach), as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head emerges and becomes dislocated at the neck; then it should be crushed until the moisture within the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 If it does not twist and does not comply for birth; then cut the head piecemeal, as far as you can manage.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If below the abdomen there is an apostema or it has hydropsy; then one must puncture it until the moisture runs out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 If the fetus is above its feet, then its extraction is easy and its guidance towards the birth canal is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If it becomes dislocated in the abdomen or chest; then one must extract it with a swaddling cloth that you have wrapped over your hand; and puncture the abdomen or chest until what is within them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If the rest of the body is removed and the head returns; then the midwife must introduce her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the birth canal is open, then introduce your hand deeply into the birth canal and search for the head, and extract it with your fingers up to the birth canal; then insert a hook or hooks and extract it with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the bone of the matrix is strained, due to a hot abscess that has happened to it: then it is not appropriate for him to be operated upon on it, but rather it is appropriate at that time to administer an infusion of moist substances, oily; and apply plasters; and sit in waters which soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is on his side, then it can be turned: then administer what was said for a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If that cannot be done, then cut it in pieces and extract it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And it is necessary not to leave anything from the second part inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 When you have completed your operation, then administer what was said for hot abscesses that occur in the matrix.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If bleeding occurs, then descend into waters of sulfur, and administer the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 And indeed I have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus; then she became pregnant again on top of it, afterwards another fetus also died within her.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 After a long period of time, an abscess occurred in his navel, and it became swollen until it was opened; and he began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I was therefore summoned for his treatment, and I treated him for a long time; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 Therefore, I placed on it from some strong plasters of attraction; and the bone came out from that place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then a few days passed for him, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I was astonished then, because there is no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 Therefore, it occurred to me that they were bones of dead fetuses.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I therefore asked the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in good condition; and she lived thus for a long time, and scarcely discharged pus from that place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 And I did not bind here this foreign one, except because in it is knowledge, and assistance to that which the healing artist administers with his hand for treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 On the forms of necessary instruments for extracting the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here is the form of the Tortoise-shaped forceps (Stricture), which equalize books, having equally two screws at the ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 Moreover, this Screw should be finer than the forceps: and to make it so, either from ebony or from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the thickness of all the wood should be as two fingers: and the edge of each of both is as one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of two pieces of wood there are two additional parts made from the same kind of wood, which have already been firmly attached to each, whose length is half a palm or less: and the width of each of them is as two fingers or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two additional parts are inserted into the cervix (matrix), so that it opens with them when you rotate the screws (two vertical screws).
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The form of the screw (screwdriver) that opens the cervix (matrix).
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another form similar to it, finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 Make it from ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of the forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 Moreover, at the end of it (the second form) there should be two additional parts as you can see here above: and the length of each additional part is approximately a palm: and the width of each of them is as two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 When you wish to open the cervix with it (the second form), then make the woman sit on the bed, with her legs apart, opening what is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two joined additional parts into the cervix: and you hold the end of the instrument below, between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with forceps, equally according to the degree of opening of the cervix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 Form of Vertigo different from that which the ancients called Form of Pushing, by which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The form (instrument) of Moldac, with which a large head is crushed, resembling a pair of forceps, as you see, having teeth at the end.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it becomes hook-like, like forceps in this form, as you see, having teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The form (instrument) of Moldac, with which a small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The form (instrument) of Uncus having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The form (instrument) of Uncus having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The form (instrument) of forceps with saw-teeth, with which the fetal head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The form (instrument) of Spathulis having two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The form (instrument) of two wider Spathulis.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 All these instruments are applied, and the more varied their forms become, and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the faster they are in their action, and higher among humans, due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not disregard one of these instruments as being prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 Indeed, it is inexcusable for their necessity.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 Chapter on the second extraction (cesarean section).
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When Second is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary to command the weak one to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Cause her to sneeze when you bind [her]: and press your hand upon her nose and her own nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If it comes out by this means, that is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If it does not [come out]: then take a pot and make a hole in the covering [of the instrument]; and put into it herbs opening the womb, such as camomile, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia bark, centaury; take all these herbs or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them over fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place a wick made of reed over the hole of the pot, and hold the other end upon the womb; and let it be until vapor reaches the concavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze as we said before.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 For Second will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then order the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or marsh-mallow mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then insert [the instrument] into the cervix and seek Second with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When you find it, then take it out gently.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If it is attached deeply in the womb, then insert your hand as I told you before until when you find Second and draw it out gently so that it does not fall down the womb with violent attraction; on the contrary, it should be moved easily from right to left; then add more to the amount of pressure.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 It will follow as a result, and she will conserve [the child] and it will pass from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 If a bone of the matrix (womb) is dislocated, as we have already said: treat it with inducing cough and medication from an oil pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 If it does not come out with everything that we have mentioned, then beware of exhausting yourself in the repetition of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 It is necessary that what comes out from the bone of the matrix to her, you tie it to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then enema her with four-ingredient ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 For this reason it will rot her within days, dissolve and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 However, when it rots, the bad smell is raised to the stomach and head, and it harms the weak one (the woman).
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, suitable fumigations must be administered for this purpose.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the ancients have already experienced that fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs is effective.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated during retention of the second delivery and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Make it like a vessel similar to an alcama, or from zere: and let the wide end be above the fire: and the fumigation should be placed over plums: hold her until the fumigation is consumed: and repeat another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 [Section heading] On the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born, and the anuses of some of them are not perforated, which have already been circumcised with a sharp scissors.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 The obstetrician must therefore pierce it (the cervix) with her finger; and if she cannot, she should pierce it with a spatula sharp (instrument); and let her be careful not to touch the muscle (with it).
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then place warm wool soaked in wine and oil on top of it (the wound).
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 If there is a fear that it may close up again, then place a lead cannula in the opening and remove it when the child wishes to be born.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And now, obstruction of the anus also occurs from the hardening of wounds or abscesses.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, it must be cut (the obstruction), then treated with what was previously mentioned from treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 Chapter on the cure of fistulas that occur in the lower part (of the body).
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter LXXX. (80)
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 Fistulas that occur in the lower part (of the body) are nodosities and swellings that occur near the anus outside; or in a space of one part; and there is one fistula, or more than one.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 When the nodosity becomes old (hard), it opens and there runs from it a watery whiteness, or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes they penetrate these fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, they are recognized by what comes out during the discharge and wind, when a sick person uses it; and perhaps worms come out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And there are fistulas (when they are) in spaces penetrating up to the bladder and to the intestine.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And there are fistulas that penetrate up to the hip joint and to the coccygeal node.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From this (fact) it is known that a fistula penetrating up to the anus, even if not penetrating, is when you insert your index finger into the anus; and insert a thin probe made of copper or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting (of the intestine).
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is a twist in it, then insert into it a slender probe made of lead or a horse hair, until you feel the probe, or a hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it fully or if nothing comes out through the opening nor any wind nor worms as I mentioned, then you will know that it is not penetrating; therefore, proceed to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 When the fistula penetrates to the bladder or the membrane of urine: then its sign is the outflow of urine from it, and its prevention is that the location should be sealed with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 But if it penetrates to the junction of the hip or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches it, unless there is a twist in it up to the bone; and the discovery of pain around the area, and that pus always comes out from it; and that medicine does not work in it, nor does it heal with an ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 And in all these fistulas that penetrate there is no cure at all; and the cure for them is futile effort upon a fool, over whom it forms.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 But in the one that does not penetrate and is not old, recovery is hoped for with a cautery; according to what I tell you, and I have already proven it: and there is, as I inform you, that the patient lies weak on his back between your hands; and you lift his legs up to above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his abdomen.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then insert a probe of lead or copper if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know where the probe has reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 But if the patient feels it around the anus, then you must insert your finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 If you feel the probe penetrating by itself through what you have detected with your finger, beyond what you feel between your finger and the fistula or the flesh; then you will know certainly that it is penetrating; therefore, do not labor in it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They say, however, that flesh heals in some men, and from the medication that is expected to be of help, it is, to apply a subtle cautery according to the size of the Fistula, as previously mentioned, and to introduce the ignited one into the Fistula until it reaches the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then do this twice, or three times, until you know that all those added fleshes filtered, which are similar to the feathers of a bird's quill, have been burnt.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then care for it with linens rolled in butter until those burnt fleshes come out; then care for it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 And if it comes out and does not reach your finger that is in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or sifac between it and the probe; and you see the fistula following the skin surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go cutting with the probe until the incision reaches the end of the probe tip, and the probe is released and falls off.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then clean those filtered fleshes similar to the feathers of a bird's quill, so that no part remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If however blood prevails over you and loosens between you and your operation, so that those fleshes fall off; then it is better what is done, and more expedient for help, to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Because the cautery with fire brings good results, the burning of those added fleshes and the removal of blood, and the drying out of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then treat that with linen wound dressings soaked in butter, or boiled calves' horns, until the place emits pus, and the burnt flesh emerges into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then treat the wound with hardening ointments that cause tough skin to grow: there are remedies which contain styptic and astringent substances.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when it is being restored, then it will heal; do not fear repeated treatment.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 If the fistula has reached into the deep of the anus and is extending from the body, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 If you feel a tumor between yourself and her, and it is covered with skin or flesh, and is near to penetration: then the operation should not be performed on that, except according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 Because it is treated in one of three ways: either to cauterize it as we have said; or to cut it off, until you follow the depression of its hollow so that it is possible for you to insert linen and treatment from close by.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed too much with the cutting, so as not to cut the muscle containing the anus, and an accidental discharge of excrement without will occur.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then treat it with what I have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 Perhaps it will heal itself; or stretch the skin, and cleanse it after you have cut it as we have said, either when there is a tumor, or with another tool of sharp point.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then cleanse the fleshy parts that are cut, until you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with cutting and the upper opening where it is consolidated; and the fistula remains open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the weak side.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes a fistula is drained in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula, which is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and the edge of the anus. Then take a probe with perforated tip, which is like the aleskef point, that is, prepared from leather, in this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a thread rolled up from five strands, and around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it penetrates the edge of the anus internally, then pull out the thread from that hole in such a way that you insert your finger into the anus and draw out the end of the thread, and gather both ends together: and tighten each one, and let it go for one or two days: and the more the thread enters the flesh, tighten it well, until the flesh between the two ends of the thread falls out and drops: then take care of the wound until it heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in any way that you can prepare it, as long as it is not too deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For you have no reason to do this for the sake of saving flesh, if you cut into it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then proceed as we said until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The form of the spatulis-spined probe for draining a fistula, whose sharpness is very acute on one side and the other side is not sharp, as you can see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 Chapter on the sewing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows upon their incision, and care for fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Within the anus are things resembling charcoal or plums; or as if they were grains of wheat.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 They are small and large; blood flows from them constantly, and there is one, and there are many of them.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 They are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those that are outside the anus are usually of a little moisture, from which runs citrus water or not much blood with a constant flow; and they are according to the body's color.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 The treatment of that which is within the anus is to instruct the patient to take a laxative; and it is expressed until it appears from the anus, and the athelia becomes apparent to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, hang them with hooks; or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If they are not held by hooks due to their moisture and softening; then take them with a rough cloth or with a glove made of double wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them and sprinkle some hot powders over them after cutting to keep the area hot for cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or cauterize them according to what was stated in the previous chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not obey the expulsion, then administer a laxative to the patient with a small purge, so that it cleanses what is in the anus, and the expulsion quickly obeys when the patient empties himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If the athelia are outside the anus, then their situation is light and easy; you take them with your nail or take them with a hook and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them as we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 If the incision is with iron, then one must administer suture in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take a thread rolled up and insert it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then pull out the athelil towards the upper part and make it penetrate with the point into the root on the other side; and roll up two ends of the thread, one on the lower part of the needle, and they should be broad; and tie the athelil tightly with a strong knot.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then tie the thread and draw out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all the athelils and leave one; do not sew it up, so as to avoid excess bleeding.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or pitch over the anus and put it on the anus; and order the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then let him go until he falls asleep.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When the athelils have fallen, take care of them with ointments, and with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 Chapter on the Treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For many times it happens due to drying of feces and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 If they have hardened and medicine does not work for them: then one must shave with a razor or with the nail until they become moist and remove the superficial layer that prevents their consolidation.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then take care of them until they consolidate as required.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If they do not consolidate: then shave them again with a stronger razor than the first, until they bleed a lot and then take care of them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 Chapter on the Treatment of Worms and those not affected by worms; and on the Scurfy and Ants.
Caput LXXXII.	 Head, LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 You should know that Almirmar is not anything other than a round knot resembling the head of a nail; it forms in the whole body but especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers, and it causes pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 Therefore, it must be cut what is around the nail head and held with forceps or a tweezers and removed from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then take care of that (the wound) and, if you wish, cauterize it as described in the previous chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 From the athelil (a type of wart), one is a small, rough, filtered outgrowth that is round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And they frequently occur in children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 And its treatment is to stretch the athelil, cut it; or stitch it with silk thread or wool until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine, as mentioned before; and the inverse athelils are now removed and not the normal ones with the tool I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 A formica (ant) is also a small, filtered outgrowth, thick, on the surface of the body, extending deeply; when cold is felt, it feels like an ant bite and appears throughout the body; and they most frequently occur in hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 And its treatment is to take a reed from the goose feather or strong vulture feather; and place the reed on the formica (ant) until it holds the circumference of the reed with its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then turn your hand with the reed until you cut what is around the formica (ant); and place it in deep flesh and remove the formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, do this with a reed of brass or iron in this way.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 The cannula should be placed above, drawing it upwards so as to loop around the finger for its relief and its own reversal.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you wish to cauterize a scabies, as previously mentioned in the cauterization of Athilih in the chapter on cauteries.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 Chapter on the shapes of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus, and the dissolution of the abdomen, and colics.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 When an enema is made from silver, or gold, or brass melted down, or mallet-work.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes these instruments are small, and large, according to those in whom they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore what is administered in the cure of small children should be small; and those with weak or painful anuses, so should their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	 Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	 Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The cannula of this, i.e., the upper part where the uterus is tied, should be wide according to this method; and it should have a distinction so that the uterus can be tied as you see, and its lower end which is inserted into the anus, should be closed, i.e., not open, soft, very thin, drawing towards subtlety; and in one of its sides there should be two holes, and in the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of rods, and slightly smaller, and the uterus in which the medicines are placed should be from the bladder of an animal; or from a sheep's parchment, which should be small like a little ewer; whose root should be one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And it should be pierced with many holes as it is turned, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into those holes a thread, for example, from raw flax, which should be from ten threads or about that much, and tie it together with the bladder like an ewer.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When a bladder is placed within it (the patient), tighten at the neck with a strong constriction of a clyster, using two distinct parts.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then clysterize it afterwards.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the form of the circle depicted here and the holes (or perforations).
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of clysterizing it is that you should fill the bladder or the urinary bladder with medicine which is heated according to the tolerance of the sick person: and be careful that it is not too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the sick person lies down on his back and raises his legs towards above: and place under him a sheet, that is skin upon which men lie or linen.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with white egg yolk, or with mucilage of fenugreek or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then introduce it (the clyster) into the anus with care.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then let the attendant take hold of the bladder with both his hands at once, and squeeze it with force, until everything that is in the clyster passes into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the clyster, and let the sick person raise his legs towards the wall (or side of the bed).
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine forces him to evacuate, then hold it as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps all that night with it, it is more beneficial for his recovery.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 But if you clysterize him in cases of the disease of the bowels (or intestines) and his evacuation is hastened: then repeat the clyster until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If there are hemorrhoids or painful sores in the anus, then let the clyster be very subtle, soft, from the clysters with which children are clysterized.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this is the shape of a subtle clyster over which the skin is to be tightened.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 On treating wounds of the head without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Head LXXXIIII. (This seems to be a Roman numeral, which is not
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 I have previously spoken about the division of treatment for wounds in another book; here I will speak about their treatment with hands and remedies as a supplement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, I say that wounds are classified according to the cause of the wound and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 Therefore, the kinds of wounds are as numerous as the blows of a stone: either an incision with a sword or knife: or a blow with a spear, log, arrow, and similar things from many other objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that occur according to the parts of the body are such as a wound on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or back, and similar from these members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am the one telling the treatments for some wounds, in order to set forth my reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I shall begin with simple head wounds, because the description of compound wounds will come at the beginning of Chapter Three.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore. (It appears that this sentence does not follow any previous statement
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no bone fracture, consider whether it was caused by a blow of a stone or something similar, and the skin is only broken; the wound is large and one fears an abscess forming from hot suppurations; then rush, and make a cephalic vein let-down at once; and do not delay this; and draw out from the blood according to the strength of its potency; if there is nothing prohibiting venesection, especially if the blood flowing from the wound is scant.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let the venesection be from the opposite side of the wounded part. (This could mean letting blood from the unaffected or healthy side of the body, to help reduce pressure on the
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 And let the sick avoid filling himself with food and thick drinks.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If something forbids reduction (diet), then reduce from food, not approach meat or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And place on the wound if it happens to him an abscess that is hot, a hot mustard poultice soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine containing hysop (hyssop).
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 If you are secure from a hot abscess, then place on the wound if it is new with its own blood and has not changed the air around it; and if already the air around it has changed, then place some ointments on it until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If the wound is large or from a sword cut, and similar: do not gather its edges together with stitches, then gather it with ligatures, as I will tell you about for wounds of the belly concerning their suturing.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If the wound has been detected to be from a bone and hangs and there is no retention of it except for a small suspension, then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then take care of the wound with medicines and restore the hard flesh to its place where there is skin; and order the sick one to be fed with foods that are thick, such as heads, cooked wheat, until it becomes soft; and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 If you find decay on the skin that does not adhere to the bone: then cut off all the decay and throw it away; then take care of it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If in these wounds there is an artery or a vein from which blood flows and it cannot be cut off with medicines, then search for the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If you find it uncut, then cut it with a spatula or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If necessity compels and it does not comply with what was said, then cauterize it until the blood is cut off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If the wounds are small and simple, their state is easy and light; in this way, you should sprinkle this powder on them, because it solidifies them before the air alters them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Method of the powder for healing.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unslaked lime; grind it all well and sieve it; then fill the wound with this powder and apply a good bandage until it sticks well to the wound, and coagulate it with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then bind it on top with small bandages, and let it remain unopened until it does not come off.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 For the medicine will not be removed from him until he is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes lime alone does this, when there is no olibanum or dragon's blood available to you; it performs the same operation on many large wounds, when it must be placed over them and bound, and the wounds are recent with their own blood which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 If the air has already altered [the wound] in some way, especially when it is during summertime, then this powder's purpose is not suitable; so take care of it with what I said, namely by placing something soothing on them, such as certain ointments; or place poultices made from barley flour, boiled with water and honey over them until they release pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of the rest of the healing, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 But if a fracture happens on the bone with the wound and it is small, then extract it using Gesthi; and I will now say the treatment for fractures of the skull that will follow.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 Chapter on Neck Wounds.
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If a wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple wound of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If the nerve of the neck or an artery has already been cut, if it is a nerve: then there is no skill in treating it except to divert its cure along with that which causes violent stiffness, such as ziniar and zegi and similar ones.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Since nerves are harmful and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not put anything cold at all on the wound: since the substance of nerves is cold and their continuity is with the brain, which is above the organs; and let it be treated with soft medicines such as lime mixed with sweet water several times infused with oil or with rose oil, or turpentine when it is washed even with sweet water; and other mineral stones in this way, and moist unguents.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If the wound is large, then administer suture or sew its edges with strips of skin (or fat).
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If the wound is deep or a cavity appears at its lower part where pus accumulates, then pierce it in a more depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If the artery has already been cut in the wound and blood flow follows: then separate it, or cut it off, and tie it; or cauterize it if necessity requires this.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If a fracture of the neck of the mandible or the entire mandible has occurred and the molars have been saved: then attach strips of skin to it with suture above the cervix of the throat, and do not touch the throat, but instead lay it down, and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then tie it with a suitable suture and leave it for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it yourself with ointments containing styptic and astringent properties until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then inspect it thoroughly. If there are any bone fragments in it, remove all of them, or as many as possible: and what cannot be prepared, leave it until the wound rots, separates, and heals by itself.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If the wound is recent, then sprinkle powder on it as I previously mentioned.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If it appears that a bone is present in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it as described in its respective chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 Chapter on Wounds Treated with Spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a wound made by a lance or knife and you see its depth, then assess it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If pus is coming out of the wound when the person who has been wounded breathes heavily, then you know that the wound is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If the depth is not great and the wound is fresh with blood, then do not put powder on it for the first hour or compress it, so that blood does not accumulate in its depth and return to the heart and kill the wounded person: instead, apply astringent ointment and solve it twice daily.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If astringent ointment is not available to you, then place a piece of old cotton over the wound opening to absorb what comes out of it due to moisture: and make sure that the wounded person sleeps on the wound so that what accumulates in it runs off.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If three days or more have passed since the wound occurred and the wounded person does not experience spasms, no bad heart tremors, no constriction of breathing, and the rest of its conditions are good: then you know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Care for yourself and with linen cloths, and the rest of the treatment, until you are healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If it is cut open for healing and already opens up always, then know that it has become a Fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Care for it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if it is a wound from sword or knife cut, and simple on the surface of the chest or back, then care for it with what has preceded from stitching, if it is large; or with dust, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 If it has already made an impression on the bone and cut out fragments from it: then examine the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 If they are not separated, then leave them until the wound rots, for extraction of them is painful.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 For wounds happening to other parts of the body, the judgment in treatment is the same as what we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 Chapter on abdominal wounds and the outlet of the intestine, and their evacuation.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 A rupture that happens to the abdomen is large, medium, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 From a large rupture, at times, the intestine comes out, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Therefore, their insertion and suturing is required, and their stitching is more arduous and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 And even a small rupture may be difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore, the reduction of them is more difficult if you do not hasten to their insertion to their place immediately; because it swells, opens up, and becomes enlarged; therefore, the entrance of it is difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore, a medium rupture is more advantageous because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is with these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 You should know that suturing a vein is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two common sutures meet in suturing the abdomen, and in suturing other wounds of the body; and two other sutures communicate specifically with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, they are more appropriate for suturing the abdomen: and I tell you one each with an explanation and a declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore, when a wound is small and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it; then it is due to one of the two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Either because of the small size of the rupture, as we said; Or because there is an inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 When that is the case, then it is necessary to heat it up, so that you immerse a sponge or damp cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or boil in water squill, cumin, fennel, and wormwood with the intestine until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes it does vinegar in which there is a stoppage; and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 When you see that the inflation has been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which wormwood or mallow was boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For this reason, the entry is stimulated with it when the wound is small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If, however, the return occurs after this treatment, then plug the rupture with a little, with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than cutting; and no pressure to cut is made after necessity and lack of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 Let the part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let the fine end not be as subtle as a spatula, but rather slightly blunt; and this is the one that resembles a thorn, as you can see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own place, if possible on top of it: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 When the wound is wide at the lower part of the abdomen: then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then put his head and his chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly if the wound is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then direct your attention and thought always in this: that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And so, it is necessary to insert this into large wounds and into medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 In small wounds, place it according to what you have prepared.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then cause a faithful servant to be present between your hands, who holds the entire wound with his hand and binds it up.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then cut out some thread following something for the one who follows to sew; and this is the common method of suturing one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is that you receive a needle or a number of needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then cut off from the end of the wound a length equal to one finger of a ring, that is to say, of a doctor; and insert one needle beyond which you introduce thread in both edges of the skin, with both edges of the sifac that is under the skin from the inside, until it penetrates through another part; and you have already bound together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the sifac; and there are four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then sew with double thread around the needle several times from both parts at once, until the two edges of the wound are bound together properly.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then release the thickness of the finger also, and tie another needle: afterwards draw it straight with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Do not cease to do that with the needle that you need until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 Let the needle be of medium thickness between thickness and subtlety, because subtle needles deeply penetrate flesh quickly; and large ones have a difficult entrance into the skin; for this reason, they should be medium in subtlety and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 And it is not fitting that the needle be shaped at both ends near the skin closely so as not to penetrate the flesh quickly and open the wound before its consolidation, and so that they do not elongate even with suturing, preventing the wound from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the tips of the needles so as not to hurt the weak when sleeping; and place small pieces of cloth from all sides that hold the tips of the needle; and release them until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And this form of suturing with needles in this manner is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Because it suffices for their suturing one or two needles or around them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second kind of suturing is common, namely when you gather with suturing the four extremities; the four skin extremities, and the two sifac extremities as one, with a needle on which the thread is rolled equally in subtlety and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then when you penetrate with the needle these four extremities, draw back the needle from the part where you started so that the thread falls down from the upper part of the wound; thus it is a suture, just like the suture of cloth when they are sewn together, and place between every stitch a quantity equal to the thickness of a little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 Humans know this stitch.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this stitch, I myself sewed the wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was larger than one palm: and from the intestines there came out about two palms from the middle intestine, and the tear was in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 I then brought it back after his intestines were set outside for 24 hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 The wound therefore healed up in a space that was about 15 days: and I cured him, and he got well: and he lived after that for many years, turned back to his ways.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the doctors had judged that he would not get well.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And it was a miracle that I did not cure it with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was in the place where no ointment could be found, nor any medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 Therefore I put over the wound a warm cloth twice a day, and I washed it with water of honey until it got well.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 However, I shall speak about two kinds of stitches according to the report in speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it is to begin with sharp stitching: and you insert a needle from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the needle goes through the skin and along the length and width of the whole body: then release the end of the sifac on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the end at the other side from the inside out at the opposite end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When you make it penetrate in this way, then make it penetrate thus in the same end: and release the end of the sifac on that side, and let the needle penetrate to the end from the inside out at the other end: and let it penetrate with your penetration where you are causing it to penetrate into the sifac end, which is in that part, until it enters entirely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then also start from this same side, and take it together with the end that is from sifac on the other side, and pull out the point from the skin which it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Bring it back to the same skin, and take together with it the end of sifac that is on the other side with this end of mirach: pull it out from the skin that is on its side, and do this alternately and in reverse order until you have pulled it all out according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 The sum of this suture is that you should make the sutures of skin, which are the skins themselves: thus, you should sew one end of sifac with one part of the skin's edge: and you should release it with the other part, until you have finished.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second species of suture mentioned by Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This discourse is told as if you should tie it up in the same way as some healers do, that is to gather all parts that are fitting by nature and bring together: and apply one end of sifac to its other end, and apply one end of mirach to another end of it.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And this is done as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 You should bend the point towards the end of mirach that is near you from the outside part, and make it penetrate to the inside: and release both ends of sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then bend back the point, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in both ends of sifac.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both (of them) back and make both penetrate from the inside to the outside in two ends of mirach that are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture and is the suture that was mentioned earlier.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 This is therefore the saying of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The repair of the abdominal suture is done with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 What is to be done, insert one thread into each of them, and begin with the introduction of the needle from what is near you, and make it pass through until the other side, according to the equal stitch of those who sew leather equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then the suture of it is more difficult than the other parts of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment of the medicine for wounds is the judgment for other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 What is to be done, when you seize a recent wound with its own blood before it changes through air, and you reduce the bowel, and tie it, and make it fit, then place it on powder of lime.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 If the air has already altered the wound: then place on it certain ointments which are present to you, until they make pus; and let the threads fall, and bind with sifac, and press with a mirror.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it as is the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 If there are no medicines present to you, then immediately place on it, as soon as it begins to emit pus, old cloth; and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not need another medicine in many positions when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 If you fear that the wound communicates with the main parts in injury, then it is necessary to immerse a soft wool in oil of temperate heat, or rose oil; and place it in the girdle around the parts which are between the groins, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then clisterize him with warm stiptic wine: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and an opening has been made penetrating to the concavity of it.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal; and what is from the small intestines is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The jejunum intestine, which is named so, does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the size of them, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of the proximity of its nerves to nature.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 If what proceeds from the wound is pus, and you find it fresh: bring it back as you bring back the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 But if time has passed and it has become green or black: then you must stitch it with a thread above the place that has become blackened, so that there is no bleeding.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For in pus there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of the thread hanging from below on the lower part of the wound outside it: so as to relieve your pressure upon it, and the extraction of the pus at the site of the wound, and the emission of the wound's pus.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Chapter on the Wound that Occurs in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is a rupture in the intestine and it is small: then it is possible for it to be restored in some people: because I have seen one who was wounded in his abdomen with a lance thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old: and it became a fistula, and exuded feces, and gases.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 I therefore placed the treatment, until I was confident of its healing; neither did I cease to investigate it, until it was healed and the location was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I saw the location already consolidated, I feared something bad might happen to the sick man concerning his stomach; and it did not happen to him from that bad thing.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in better dispositions for himself, eating and drinking, and urinating, and went into the bath, and was trained in his own diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And some of the experienced men said, when a wound occurs in the Intestine and it is small, then it should be tied thusly.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And it is to receive ants with large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then gather two lips of the wound and place one ant with an open mouth on both lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When its head is upon them, and it closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it will stick to them and not be removed.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease to make this with an ant according to the size of the wound in its entirety.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then reduce it and sew up the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is eaten and it heals, so that no harm comes to the sick man completely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And it is now possible to tie the intestine even with fine thread; what has been taken out of the intestine of the animal and attached to it when inserted into the point.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And it is to receive the end of this thread from the intestine and scrape off much flesh.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a thin linen thread at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert the thread into the point and sew up the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then reduce it to a dislocation.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 This method of stitching with worms and intestines is not except by faith and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a large, wide wound, especially if it is on one of the slender intestines, has no other remedy except subtlety. There is no healing of it at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 Chapter on the care of ulcers and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that every wound or abscess when it becomes old and chronic, turns into an ulcer and does not consolidate, but always emits pus and does not separate: then it is called universally in whatever member it may be a fistula, and we call it a Zuchimen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And a fistula indeed is in truth a knotted filter, hard, white: with which there is no pain, to which there is a hollow of the bird's feather: and for this reason some call it Rasa, that is, the feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And in certain hours it is moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And perhaps the moisture is cut in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And sometimes this moisture is much, and little; and it is thick, and fine.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already stated in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal and is not generated in it flesh, is not for any of the nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 One of the reasons is that because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because it is bad; or because there is hard flesh within and above it, preventing the generation of flesh; or because it is full of dirt and filth; or because the ulcer itself is rotten, and the matter emitted to it is of poor quality; or because the medicine is inappropriate for its healing; or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, as happens in Caesaraugusta; in which difficult digestion of diseases occurs, and healing of abscesses is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone in it, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 I have already shown you all those causes and their signs, as well as the treatments of them with medicines in division: it is necessary here that I make you know the treatment for Fistula and Ulcer, which is done by the way of surgery with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Know therefore that Fistula occurs in all the members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For among these are Fistulae that reach to great veins and arteries, or nerves, or tendons; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs: or to any of the vertebrae in the back, or to any of the joints composed of bones; such as hands and feet: and among these are those that approach the proximity of a main member and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 What therefore among these Fistulae is according to this method, is difficult to heal from sickness and does not receive treatment, and the occupation with it is labour and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If there is any of these Fistulae whose depth does not reach to the places which I have said: and you hope for, trust in its treatment, and desire to reach knowledge about it, then take a probe made of copper or iron, if the Fistula goes straight, and explore it with that.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 If there is a twist in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe made of delicate lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Since lead being softened and curved towards twists.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to sign on it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Then close one of its openings with clisteria from among them.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 Since the moisture that you clisterize it goes backward to other openings and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then carefully investigate according to how it is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is bone or nerve there, and whether the hollow is a long or short fistula, or whether it is a fistula with many openings, which is on top of it all, with the strength of your hand: with the questioning you ask of the sick person, and the discovery of pain under pressure with your hand, and similar signs and causes from accidents.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 When you have thus established yourself in a true position, then proceed with treatment according to your confidence: and it is for you to consider whether the fistula appearing near is in a place safe at a distance from joints, nerves, arteries, veins, or any of the places I mentioned to you: then cut the fistula according to what has been said in my narrative, and remove what is in it by filtering, and corrupt flesh that arises in its opening, or pus, and similar things: and treat it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If the fistula is deep, and is straight: then it is necessary to cut it as deeply as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then cleanse the fistula from all corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then administer linen wound bandages filled with sharp medicines: and insert it into the hollow of the fistula that you grasped with iron, do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes everything that remains in the hollow of the fistula due to corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore the fistula with ointments that promote healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 If it does not heal through this, then cauterize the fistula as we have said before.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this: then ask for it, and cut the bone as I have told you: if nothing prevents you from doing so in a vein, nerve, or main member, as we have said before.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If therefore a bone is discovered in you, and there is something corrupted within it, and blackening: then scrape it off, until the entire corruption of it is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with it, until it heals up.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If it does not heal, and discharges pus as before: then know, that you have not achieved a complete removal of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Then dig into it again, and carefully investigate its reason, and cleanse it with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If it heals, it is good; and if not, then know that the corruption is in a deep remote part of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 Therefore, there is no skill in it for you, except to let it go to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If a small bone is corrupted and if it can be drawn out with fine forceps which suit to that purpose: draw it out with them.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If there are many bones: then carefully investigate the drawing of all of them, and do not leave anything in them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If something from the moist areas opposes you and there is no fear or mistake in the cutting of them: then cut those moist areas and flesh, if they are present, and release the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If there is no preparation to remove the bones from your time: then place over the wound something that rots it; and leave it until it rots what is around their bones from flesh and moistness.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And watch the wound so that it does not close up.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And bind the incision which you cut during your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Or place over it, if you fear, cotton soaked in soft sulfur oil; or cotton soaked in the Egyptian ointment, or some green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 When those [humidities] in question rot, and the bones are separated from them, let the excision of them be anointed, and their attraction as well.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 If it is a large bone such as the leg bone or hip bone and similar [bones], and what has rotted from it is a large part: then shave it down with the finest file until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If what has rotted within it is a large part, and corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it must be cut through, and it must be sawed all the way to where the corruption ends: then treat it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you this secret, which happens to a man in his thigh: place it before yourself as an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 A young man of about thirty years had pain in his thigh, caused by something that moved within him from the inside until the matter reached the thigh, and an abscess was formed with a large abscess: there was no external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 So the time passed with the error of physicians until the abscess was opened, and many materials gathered there with him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 And his treatment was delayed until the thigh became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: which all discharged pus, and humors of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Therefore a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no skilled person in the art of surgery called until I saw his thigh, and the materials that ran out of those openings with great flow: even the entire body of the man had become wasted, and his color was jaundiced.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 So I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I have examined all the openings and found that they lead to each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I have dug deep, and cut through one of the openings, until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it corrupt, already rotten, decayed, putrid, and pierced through, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 I have then sawed what was exposed to me, and prepared it from the rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And rejected that which was not in the bone except for this corruption, which I cut off and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And I had already pulled it out (the pus or infection).
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed the wound dressing with solidifying medicines in a long space.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it is not healed (yet).
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried again, and exposed over the bone second above the first opening: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I sawed what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 And then I attempted to dress it (the wound).
Et non est restauratum.	 And it is not dressed (yet).
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 I then exposed it again, and did not stop cutting the bone in pieces, and trying to dress it: and it is not dressed, until I cut out about a palm's length of bone with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I dressed it with medicines, and it healed quickly, and was cured: and this repetition of the operation and section of it was not necessary except for the disposal of weakness, the frailty of the patient, and my fear of death: since it happened to him at all hours from excess evacuations with bad syncopes.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 He is therefore cured completely: and flesh hard has grown at the place of the bone, and good arrangement was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he has turned back to his dispositions: and it did not cause him any harm in walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If the projecting bone in the body is already fractured, then it is necessary that you sew it up in this manner: and it is as follows: take a ligament and bind it at the end of the projecting bone; and command someone to stretch it upward; and place another thicker ligament on the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then sew it to the flesh that surrounds the bone; extend its end so as to pull the flesh towards the lower parts; and remove the flesh from the place you wish to sew, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place a log or board under the bone below in a good position; for when you do this, it is not forbidden to cut corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 And it is necessary that the saw be over the corrupted place slightly, so that there is no corruption in the hollow of the bone; and it does not appear to the senses in its view, and compel another [part] to serve in its stead.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is corrupted and not projecting, but rather continuous with another part; and corruption is in its middle or in a part of it; then remove the flesh from all parts completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place a log below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Then saw it from the first part where there is corruption, until the saw has reached the other side; and let the saw be slightly longer than the corruption, as we said before.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If the corruption is at a joint, cut away the corrupted joint itself and saw the bone where it joins with another part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 If the corruption is at the joining of two joints, then there is no remedy but abrasion [to remove the damaged tissue].
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If the corruption is at the beak of the hand or foot, then there is a great difficulty in it.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 It is necessary for you to examine the appearance of the corruption.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And grind it (the tumor) away and clean it as much as possible for you, and when it is corrected with any tool: if it does not create opposition to the Vein or the Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that there are many cutting and sawing tools for this bone, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their hardness, their size, their smallness, their density, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to prepare every kind of instrument suitable for each operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations signify for you the type of instrument you require, when your study is prolonged.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of illnesses: then you will indeed find for yourself what suits it from instruments for every sickness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I am confirming for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will place examples on for cutting, and proof on others.
Forma Serrae.	 The form of a saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The form of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This saw-form should be properly made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 The arch of its upper part should be sharp and the blade made from iron, and the handle from boxwood, and it should be conically shaped.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 The form of a rasp for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 The head of this rasp should be in the shape of a star-headed nail and its points according to the shape of the points on a nail file.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 It is not suitable unless it scrapes with it the heads of joints when they are broken or a large and thick bone.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 The form of a larger rasp.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 Middle Razor Form.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 Wide Razor Form.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 Concave Razor Form.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 Shape of a finer razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 Shape of a curved-tipped razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 Shape of a small, flexible razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 Shape of a razor for cutting bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Also the shape of a large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 It resembles a saw and its end is like that of a chisel: it is used in many places for the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 Shape of a razor suitable for cutting through bone.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its end is triangular and sharp-edged.
Fit ex Indi.	 Made of ivory.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly, all that I have said must be made from razors, chisels and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 Section of limbs and setting of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 Rottenness occurs at the extremities, either from an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 When you have been treated for that corruption with medicine, and the treatment does not help; and if you see corruption attacking a limb which is not struck by anything: then it is necessary to cut through that limb until the corruption passes away through it, or death, or a greater evil affecting the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign which occurs is that a limb becomes dark, until it is thought to be rotten; it has been burnt by fire or rot sets in after it has turned black; it is cut through until the rot reaches what follows that limb and creeps over the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Approach with the incision of that limb, and similarly if the cause of the rot is from certain venomous animals such as the marine scorpion, viper, weasel, and similar creatures.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If corruption or a blow occurs at the end of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave any space for the rot to spread, so that it may spread over the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it occurs in the hand, then cut off at the root of the fingers, and do not leave any space for the rot to spread until it reaches the arm bone.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it enters into this [joint], then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If the rot passes beyond this [point], and you see it approximately at the elbow: then death is approaching for the sick person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 To administer treatment beyond that point is the strength of the medicine.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly do with the foot, when rot sets in at a toe; then cut off that toe at one of the joints; and if it reaches the ankle bone, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 If it goes up to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 If corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for release and leaving the sick one to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 The method of cutting a limb or sewing it is to tighten the ligament below where you wish to cut, and to tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And extend one servant ligament downwards, and another servant ligament upwards towards the top.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the flesh that is between two ligaments with a broad knife until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it is cut or sewn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 It is necessary to place a linen cloth over all the parts so that the knife does not touch a healthy place; and a wound must be added to the sickness, and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 If there is an internal bleeding while you are operating, then quickly cauterize the place; or else place some powder on it that draws blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your medicine until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded limb with an appropriate ligament and take care of it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you what happened to a man on his foot, this same thing happens to you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 Because there is a blackness occurring on his foot similar to burning by fire; and corruption first begins in one of his toes until it reaches the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 Therefore the man cut himself, after seeing corruption occurring on a limb with pain and burning; and he cut himself at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long period of time, that same corruption occurred on one of his fingers on his index hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 Therefore he came to me and tried to recover that loss with what I put on his hand from remedies after cleansing his body; and the excess was not found, and it began to spread to another finger until corruption reached his entire hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 He therefore called me to cut his hand; and I did not want it, hoping for reimbursement from him for the excess; and I also feared death itself during the incision of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Because the man's virtue was above his fall.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 Since he had given up on me, he returned to his own land; and he came back to me about it because he hurried, and he cut off his entire hand; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And I did not bring this story unless it is an aid for that which falls under the genus of this illness; and it is to show what needs to be shown, and according to how it should be done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 Chapter on the care of the sinuses, and the quality of cleansing with medications.
Caput XC.	 Chapter CXC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When a boil occurs in certain fleshy parts and the space of the boil extends until it collects pus; then it breaks or perforates and whatever is in the pus exits and leaves an empty spot as if it were a vessel; and the skin that is on top of it, like a cloth that has been made thin; and it does not reach final corruption nor press against bone, nerve, or ligament: it is worthy to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula, but if the space prolongs until corruption presses into one of these organs, then it is called a Fistula, or zukh.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And its care is to cut the entire skin as it rolls; especially when it has been made thin and resembles a cloth; and you trust that it will not adhere due to its own corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If you hope that the skin will adhere and this final corruption does not follow as a consequence; and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then treat it with Clisterium; and be aware of this for the Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it [the wound] is large and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul smell: then cleanse him with a clyster of Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and honey, portions being equal, mixed in a vessel; and boil it over fire until the medicine turns red and becomes thick like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take what is necessary from it [the substance]: and dissolve it with water and honey, and cleanse the bladder with it; and sew up its opening, and let the medicine be poured into it to the quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then remove it with pressure: do this for several days until the bladder is purified and the foul smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And sometimes the bladder is cleansed with water and ashes when this medicine is not available to you; and it is for you to take the ashes of vinewood or the ashes from oak wood, and pour water on it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then wash it and cleanse the bladder with it until you are confident that the bladder has been purified.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 But if the patient is not able to tolerate the Egyptian medicine or water and ashes, then cleanse the bladder with water and honey, to which something has been added from crushed honey.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or cleanse the bladder with honey and wine mixed together, because it is a property of honey to purify and wash; and wine makes the bladder adhere, especially when there is an excess of hardness and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 Whenever you do this and are confident that the corruption of the bladder has been removed: then cleanse the bladder with it that causes flesh to grow within it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And it is for you to take from the plaster of dyafinicon; and dissolve it with rose oil and stiptic wine, or cleanse the bladder with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 If the orifice of the Sinus is narrow and cannot take a cannula for clysters: then expand it slightly with iron; or place linen wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or Basilicon ointment until it expands.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then gather its lips with suture; and let the amount that the clyster can enter go in without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly if the orifice from which pus flows is elevated towards the higher parts: then cut it at a lower place that is within it, so that the pus runs out below; because pus, when constrained in depth of Sinus, prevents flesh generation in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus around its lower part as desired: then try to prepare a member in such a way that pus runs out from it with ease according to how you are prepared.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try not to retain anything from the pus within it; and take medicines for consolidation that are put on the mark, suitable for what you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 Spread them out on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the cloth be of such a size that there is communication throughout the entire Sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then cut with scissors a hole directly in the orifice of the Sinus, wider than the orifice of the Sinus by a little.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then spread out on a cloth soaked with soft ointment of such size as the hole; and place it above at a distance from the orifice of the Sinus to ease the discharge of pus from it; and do not remove the large cloth unless after several days, once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 The one who is above the orifice of the Sinus is the one you remove at every hour, to expel what accumulates in it from pus; and know that, whether the discharge from it is much or little, digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And again consider the place of the sinus, if its lord feels pain there, or if there is no pain in it, and if there is an abscess in it, or if there is no abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 When your treatment is extended thus, and you see the matter that comes out through the opening of the sinus, then you know that the sinus is already adhering or is approaching adherence; then dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change the linen, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 If however a subtle vapor comes out from the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing approaches, since there are people who act slowly in the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 If however an undigested pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If therefore the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its case prolonged: then add drying medicaments, but let the physicians do so, that the medicaments are humid in substance and dry in potency; such as unguentum dyafinicon, when excess is added to it from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the more distant cure that is applied, it is that you take unguentum dyafinicon, and dissolve it with rose oil, and mix upon it old wine equal in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then compound it with the above and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now make something similar to this action, when you do not have unguentum dyafinicon, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or take myrrh, aloe, and olibanum; grind all of them, and powder it over honey while it is above the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then draw a line on the skin above the tumor and sew it onto the abscess; and draw a thread with honey that you have boiled, until it swells up; then pulverize its substance and place it on the linen cloth and sew it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 Sometimes Aristolochia longa, the root of celestial lily, and lily are administered; and flour of the plant, and knotgrass.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them (the simple or combined remedies), crush and sift them; and pulverize the honey that I have mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the abscess prolongs and is not cured by this treatment, then you know that there is corruption in its depth; either it has already made an impression on the bones or on other hard parts or ligaments; then cure it with fistula treatment, as previously mentioned.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 Chapter on the treatment of corns and calluses, abrasion of the finger nail, and incision or section.
Caput XCI.	 Chapter XCI (101).
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 A corns is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb or big toe, or perhaps arises in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 When it prolongs and is neglected without treatment, and it becomes an abscess; or it rots and discharges pus until it corrodes the nail root; and perhaps it corrupts it completely, and perhaps corruption reaches the bone until it has a fetid smell; and the tip of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When you treat it (the corns), and your treatment does not produce the desired effect; then you must cut away all excess that remains from the nail with an iron.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 Indeed, cauterization is very beneficial.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If the bone is healthy and the nail also is healthy, and empty additions of the nail are pressing the flesh towards the inside and it begins to pierce and hurt it; then it is necessary that you place subtle Radium under the angle of the nail which is piercing the flesh, and push it up; and cut the flesh with ease, and put on top of what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, corrosives, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with ointments, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If corruption is already pressing into the bone, then it is necessary that you cut that bone and extract it; for the bone will never heal while there is a corrupted bone present.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see corrosion and corruption advancing on the finger, then cut it at one joint, according to the previously mentioned memorization.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 If, however, the nail is worn or struck and a violent pain occurs, then it is necessary that you use the lancet first on the weak.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut the nail with a sharp spatulate section from above to sight.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And keep the cut from reaching the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause excessive painfulness over the weak by this and there will be a cause added to the growth of the skin in the place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then take care of the place with what eases the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 A finger that is born in some human hands may be entirely fleshy; and it may have bones in some of them, and it may have a nail in it; and some of these are born at the junction of the root, or its birthplace is in some joints of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 Therefore, the one that is born in some joints of the finger does not move; and the one that is born at the junction of the finger may move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 The operation on the fleshy one amongst them is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 Cut him at the root with a wide spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 But for the one whose birth is in the junction of roots, the treatment is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore, avoid cutting him.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 However, when he is born on the digit at the end of tendons, then one must cut the flesh of him first with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then, using one of those saws fitting for that, saw the bone.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 However, consolidation that happens in fingers often occurs either at birth of a person, meaning he is born with it, or from consolidation of a wound, or burn by fire, and similar conditions.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, one must cut away that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place a cloth or gauze soaked in rose oil between them, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them; or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the location heals as required.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly, if consolidation occurs in certain fingers with the palm, then cut away that consolidation according to its preparation and the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 Chapter on Defects of Incisions.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter CXII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 Uites are swollen veins filled with melancholic superfluities that often occur in various parts of the body; and their outcome is most common in legs, especially in those traveling or working or carrying heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore, one must administer a vigorous purging of the body from black bile on several occasions.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then make venesection from the patient using a basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 Treatment of those (afflictions) with iron is according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One of them is, that it should be scented and the black blood drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And another mode is, that the vein should be elevated and everything should be drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 Cutting (it) however is according to this mode.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 First, the leg should be embroced with much hot water until the thick, foul blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then bind the weakened leg from the upper part of the hipbone of it, as far as the lower part of the thigh with plaster.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut the vein in one place or two or three in a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then elevate, that is, draw blood from the lower part of the leg with your hand upwards, and it is necessary that the lancet be applied to the weakened person first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut the nail downwards until there comes out from the blood a quantity that you see is sufficient and that the strength of the weakened person can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Then tie it up and tell him to abstain from foods that produce black bile; and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and this will harm the weakened person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 Elevation (of the leg) however is according to this mode.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Shave the weakened leg if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then immerse it (the leg) in a bath or embroce the leg on its own with hot water until it becomes red and the veins swell; or exercise it with vigorous movement if there is no bath present for him, until the limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then make an incision along the vein directly for its length; or at the end of it by the knee, or at the lower part of it by the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with awls and scrape off the vein from every side until it is apparent to the sense; and there appears at its appearance that it turns from red to blackish-blue.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When it comes out from the skin, it appears white as a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert the Radius under it until it is raised and comes out from the skin; hang it with a blind hook, soft.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then cut another section near that section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then scrape the skin from above the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then lift it with radii as you did before and hang it with another hook as you did first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then cut another section or several sections as needed.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then scrape it and make an incision on the last section at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then extract it to the section above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this until you extract it from the section above or from all sections when it comes out completely; then make an incision on it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If it does not obey you to extract and lift, then insert a pointed probe with a strong thread and tie it and extract it; or insert a radii under it and rotate your hand on all sides until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And be careful not to cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it and harm results from it on the patient.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 When you have extracted it completely, place linen soaked in wine and rose oil or olive oil over the wound site and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If the vein is contracted and twisted with a winding in various parts, and it is not as we said according to rectitude: then you must make an incision over all parts of its twisting and the winding points of itself.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then hang it with hooks until you lift the entire vein; be careful not to cut or wound the vein at your incision site, for it will be difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Preserve therefore your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The shape in which a wound heals is the vine.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The shape of an incision in a blind man.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 The scarring in this type of incision is not like that of other incisions, nor does it have a sharp point to damage the vein; rather, it has a thick folding, soft; because if it were delicate, it would pierce the vein with its delicacy; on the contrary, excess thickness is superfluous, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 On the extraction of the vein of the leg.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated in the legs on hot lands, as Alizegi says, and in the land of Arabs, and in dry, hot lands of little softness, that is, where no grass grows nor tree.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body apart from the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 Indeed, its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs beneath the skin, as it happens within the bodies of snakes and roundworms and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And the sign of the emergence of this vein is that which happens when there is a violent inflammation in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then the place is blistered.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then the vein begins to emerge from that blistered spot, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When it appears from that spot, then you should wind around it a piece of lead whose weight is half a kentenarie and the same number of knots; and let the suspended lead hang down from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Whenever something comes out of it towards the outside, wind that up in lead and knot it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it prolongs itself much, then cut off a part of it and wind up the rest.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 Do not incise it rootwise before it entirely comes out.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 If you cut (it), it contracts and enters into the flesh: and causes an abscess to occur, and corruption at the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore, it is necessary that it be gently treated and slowly extracted until it entirely comes out and nothing remains of it in the body: and from this vein comes forth in some men what is along its length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has come to me, because it came out of a man of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If it is cut during your treatment hour: then insert a probe into its opening and perforate it with a long hole, along with the body, until all that is in it from matter has been evacuated: and administer the corruption of the place with medicines for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then take care of it with treatment for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself: and there are many openings to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Take care of it, as we have said in the division, and with what was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 [Chapter heading:] Section on worms generated beneath the skin, and this is called Bouina's Disease.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This disease is called Bouina's Disease in a certain land among us: because it often happens to cows, and there is a small worm born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 It moves throughout the body, going up and down: and it is noticed by the senses during walking from one limb to another until it bursts at any place where it bursts through the skin and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 The generation of it (the tumor) is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 As worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and ascaris, occur in the abdomen.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And it (the stone) is feared from its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it (the stone) moves within the body and rises to the head and reaches its location, then perhaps it opens there, and exits, and destroys the eye; and this happens frequently.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 Since therefore you wish to cure it (the stone) and remove it, this can only be done during its movement (or passage) and appearance to the sense of sight.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 Therefore, what is above it (the stone) must be compressed with a strong bandage and what is beneath it with a compression of the ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it, and remove it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it (the stone) has gone deep into the flesh and you cannot find it, then place a cautery on its location with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 The larger one (the stone), which is feared, is its corruption that destroys the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If you see it (the stone) has already reached the head near the eye, then compress above it with a good bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it, and remove it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 The sick person must use self-cleansing of the body with medications that dissolve bad humors putrid.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 Let him avoid foods causing putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 Section on the pain of Nakir (a medical case or disease).
Caput XCV.	 Chapter XCV (105).
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This disease is known as Nakir in our land; it is a pain that occurs in certain members, then changes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And indeed I myself have seen it, as I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was summoned to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And she had rolled up her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after staying for an hour, I saw the swelling moving with a probe, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it could: like living silver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 Therefore, the pain left that place, and it was fixed in her shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then she sat for an hour, and ran through the rest of the body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then she told me that she was being turned over in her entire body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 Therefore, I marveled at the swiftness of her change from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed, before that, I had not seen this illness appear in my eyes in such a way as described above.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 Nevertheless, I have seen many who find pain changing from member to member; but I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that this is the case except for the reason that the woman was one of those who are from the dry bodies with detected veins; hence, it appears to the sense that the windiness has been changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that this does not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and with bodies that are moist, of the hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 Since you wish to cure it and the patient feels that pain; then if it is visible to you as we have said, then press on it quickly and under it; cut above it as soon as possible, until that windiness, constricted, comes out; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If you do not see it with your eyes: then take care of it by excision of the body, and with that which expels wind, and soften them with fetid pills, and with pills of serapeo, and similar ones.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 On the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows are classified according to their types and the places in which they fall on the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 The diversity of arrows is as follows: for there are some that have large points, and small; concave, and blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And among them are those that have three corners.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And among them are those that have tongues.\]
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And among them are those with stars.\]
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 But as for those that fall on the limbs, they are classified into two ways.\]
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 Either the limbs are cavities like the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar ones.\]
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When a arrow falls into any of these cavities and appears to you as signs of death, which I will tell you later, then it is necessary that you take out the extraction of this arrow from them, for death follows it wherever it may be, in many situations.\]
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when these signs of evil do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the cavity, then take out the arrow itself, and care for the wound.\]
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 The signs of the brain are as follows when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone, and exits through a hole above the brain: for there follow from this sweat, dizziness, fainting, reddening of the eyes, swelling, reddening of the tongue, spasms, confusion of mind, and vomiting of cholera.\]
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	Blood may come out from the nostrils, or the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 The speech may be cut off, and the voice destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 White moisture comes out from the wound's place, like pulp.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And it comes out from it resembling serous fluid of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and draw out the arrow if it does not come out by itself.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of an arrow in the heart are when it falls near the left breast, and it feels as if it is fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to the pulse: and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And this is followed by coldness in the limbs, cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Know therefore that death approaches without doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 The sign of an arrow in the lung is the exiting of frothy blood from the wound: and the containers that follow the neck are to be emptied, and the color of the patient is changed.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And it exhales a large, deep breath: and it seeks cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls into the pleura, which is in the chest: then it is near small ribs: and a great panting with violent pain, with sighing: and all the limbs of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 If the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 If the arrow falls into the abdomen and is fixed there: something fecal comes out from the wound, or pus, or an already disrupted intestine.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore there is no hope for his recovery nor in drawing out the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If the arrow falls into the bladder and comes out urine: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the patient: then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The remaining members, such as the face, neck, throat, spatula, help, dorsal spondylus, furcula, hip, leg, and similar members are saved according to several dispositions when the arrow does not strike an artery, or nerve: and the arrow is not venomous.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you what I saw regarding these arrows, so that you may understand it in relation to your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 That is, because a man had an arrow fall into his tear duct of the eye, at the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore I removed it from the other side, under the ear fat of him; and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye as a result.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I removed another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen upon him in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already concealed, and I did not obtain any part of it except for its small end that adhered to the wood; and the arrow was large among arrows of the Tartars, with a soft iron tip, in which there were no feathers.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 Therefore the Jew was healed, and no harm came to his eye as a result.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 The arrow was Arabic and it had feathers.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 Therefore I cut along the same (line), between two gullets; and already it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 I therefore sharpened myself with that (instrument) until I removed the arrow; and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I removed another arrow from a man who it had fallen upon his abdomen; and we thought that he was going to die as a result of it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After thirty days had passed without any change in his condition, I made an incision along the arrow; and I opened it up, and removed the arrow; and he was healed, and no harm came to him as a result.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man who an arrow had fallen upon his back, and the wound around it had consolidated.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years it came out of the root of his hipbone.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 I have seen a woman to whom an arrow fell into her womb, and the wound has healed upon her, and the arrow remains within her; and none of her conditions were changed, and the woman did not find harm in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 I have seen another man to whom an arrow fell on his face; and the wound has healed, and remains, not causing him much pain; and many similar things have happened.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 And I extracted an arrow from a nobleman of the king, which had fallen upon him in the middle of his nose, and had already started to descend slightly towards the right; and the arrow was completely hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 Therefore, I was summoned for his treatment after the loss of the arrow until three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 Then I found the arrow wound to be very narrow.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 Therefore, I examined it with a fine probe and did not feel it; but he himself was finding a puncture and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 So I hoped that the puncture was at the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 Then I applied the place with an ointment containing attractant and softening properties, confident that the wound would heal and the sign of the arrow would appear so that I could cut it; but this did not happen at the desired location, indicating that the arrow had healed.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 Therefore, I applied the ointment for many days upon him; but it did not happen as desired, and the wound healed in the meantime; and the man remained weak from extraction of the arrow until a certain day when he felt the arrow within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 Therefore, I placed a strong medicine, a corrosive upon the wound for many days until it was opened; and when I examined it with a fine probe, I felt the sharp end of the arrow which had stuck into the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added the sharp medication to the wound opening until it became evidently visible to us the end of the arrowhead; and it passed with that space of time approximately four months with it.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then when the wound was expanded and I was able to insert forceps into it and move it, but it did not obey to come out; then I did not stop trying to refine and work on it with various means until on one day with well-made forceps, according to the shape that came in the end of the chapter, I pulled it out.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I healed the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And certainly the physicians judge that the nose cartilage cannot be healed.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 So I healed it (the wound), and the wound became sound and healthy again with strong health; nothing harmed it at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the quality of the extraction of some arrows: so that you may place the rule and significance on that which I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Because the parts and divisions of this art are not grasped with the narrative; neither does the book comprehend it, and the wise craftsman compares little to much; and with what is present, over what is absent: and finds a new operation and new instrument for descent of foreign matters in this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 Therefore I say that arrows do not come out from the limbs to which they are fixed except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or by attraction from the place from where it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or by means of the opposite part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which comes out where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fatty place; and it attracts and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 If it does not obey to come out at the hour when it falls; then it is necessary that you leave it for some days until the flesh that is around it decomposes; and the attraction of it will loosen and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 If it is punctured into a bone and does not comply with you for drainage, then let it be for some days; and repeat it daily with attraction and motion, until it drains out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 If it does not comply with you for drainage after some days, then it is necessary that you pierce through the bone from all sides with a sharp awl until the sutures swell up.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then draw it out and remove it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If the arrow is fixed in the skull bone and has proceeded into one ventricle of the brain, and certain signs of its damage that I mentioned appear: then refrain from drawing out the arrow, and let it be until it becomes equal with its surroundings after some days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if the arrow has reached the heart, then death is not delayed for it.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 If the arrow is not fixed, except within a bone alone, and does not penetrate to the heart: and remains weak for some days, and nothing happens from those signs: then proceed with the drawing out of the arrow and its extraction.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 If it is fixed very deeply and does not comply with you for drawing: then administer a sharp awl around the arrow as I told you; afterwards take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 If the arrow has already been hidden in the body and concealed from feeling: then search for it with probing.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If you feel it, then draw it out with certain tools that are suitable for drawing it.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you cannot reach it because of the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow in depth, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there: then mark it until the wound swells up, and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If it is fixed in the ears with which it is held: then cut away the flesh attached to them from all sides as much as you can, and proceed, if you cannot reach the flesh by cutting through the fracture of the ears or by twisting them, until it breaks out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	When administering the extraction of an arrow, wherever it may be, then use twisting of your hand with forceps to all parts until it comes out. And, with utmost subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken and the attraction and extraction of it become difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you are unable to extract the arrow within an hour, then let it be for a number of days until what is around it becomes rotten.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then repeat the process. For indeed, a bladder will be formed around it. If, however, it causes bleeding against you, then administer what we have said in its chapter for cure: and keep your strength from cutting the vein, nerve, or sinew.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer every method possible for the evacuation of the arrow: let it be with ease, calmness, slowness, or firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 It is necessary that when you pull out the arrow, it should be as weak as it was at the time of the arrow's wounding in the same figure.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 For it is more advantageous.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 If, however, this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible according to the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 The arrow that comes out from the opposite side of the other part or has already started to come out towards the outside, or makes a hump at the end of the arrow by the sensation of the skin above it and you see it protruding: then cut above it, and make the incision according to the size that the forceps can grasp.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then pull it out: for indeed, it becomes easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 If it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow presses into the bone and swells: then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: dismiss her for some days; then return her, until she exits (heals).
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the wood of the arrow is within her, then push her along with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 If however the wood has fallen out and there is a desire to administer a thrust: then insert into her a concave instrument so that it enters the concavity of the arrowhead; afterwards push her with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If however the arrow is concave, then push her along with the instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 The arrow will be absorbed by that (medicine).
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to remove all the flesh in which there is the venom; if this is possible for you (to do so).
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then take care of her with whatever suits that (medicine).
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the arrow falls into the chest, or the abdomen, or the bladder, or the side; and is close to that which you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut it, and beware of the vein, or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then heal the wound, if you see it, and take care of that (the injured area) until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The tips should be similar to the beak of a bird, which are made of iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And there are many shapes made of them, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size and smallness of the arrow, and the width and depth of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The form of the pusher with a concavity.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the form of the deaf-pusher (the one used to push an arrow that has no head
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is the tip of a deaf-arrow (without a head) like a rod, to be absorbed into the concavity of the arrow and pushed along with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The end of the lever pushing (thing) is concave like a bird's feather: so that the arrow's entrance may be into it and the push of it.

Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 Because the vein is not visible there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And it is necessary that you hold the end of your hand with the phlebotomy lancet a little bit; and make the blood flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then bind it at night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 For it heals quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 Chapter on the Phlebotomy of Veins (Guidegium).
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 There are two benefits of phlebotomy according to Guidegium: for the constriction of shortness of breath, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that are corroding (herpes or eumenies).
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 And the nature of this phlebotomy is that it tightens the sick man under both his necks with a bandage; and the worker stands over the head of the sick man, and the sick man sits on a chair.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then the phlebotomy vein is made slightly larger than usual for phlebotomy.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then draw out a measured amount of blood, or according to what you see according to the need that is there.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Do the same with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Then release the bandage, and tighten two veins with a moderate pressure; so that the sick man is not choked.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And leave it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 The wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 Chapter on the Phlebotomy of Veins (Algebrichium).
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 The veins according to Algebrich benefit phlebotomy because they contribute to alcohol in the mouth, and corruption of the gums; and bad ulcers; and cracks in the lips, and bad ulcers, even those that are in the nose, and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the quality of bloodletting for them is that you make the sick person sit before you, and tighten his neck with a bandage.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then roll back his lip, and look at the two veins: one is on the right side of the lip, and the second is on the left: the identification of each is through their blackness.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And this is true because around them are small veins, dark ones.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Make therefore an incision on each with a cutting incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If there is doubt about you and you do not know which one it is: then aim for a larger incision of them, and that one will be more visible.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And similarly do with the two veins that are on the upper lip: and most commonly is the custom with this: and cut the two veins that are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 Chapter on bloodletting: Vein under tongue after cephalic bloodletting.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 But of the two veins that are under the tongue, bloodletting helps: because cephalic bloodletting is for afflictions in the throat, and illnesses of the neck, and illnesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the quality of bloodletting them is that the sick person sits between your hands before the sun: and you open his mouth wide, and look under the tongue on one side, and on the other side a vein: and the color of each inclines towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Bloodletting therefore both (veins): and be careful not to destroy your hand while bloodletting them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 Because under his are the arteries, and perhaps there will be a flow of blood from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 Chapter on three veins on the arm (cubitus).
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 But the three veins that are bloodletted on the arm (cubitus) have been the custom of bloodletting in all human beings.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And phlebotomy (of these) is done according to two modes.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Either by pricking with a broad leech (myrtinus), or by cupping to thinness (oliuari), or by cutting with a surgical knife (cultellus), and this is called Alnsil.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus Alnsil (is) what meets for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from these (are) the wide and the thin forms according to the size and narrowness of the veins. The form of leeching (phlebotomy with a leech) is wide, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it (Alnsil) meets for opening hollow, full, projecting, appearing, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this leech (phlebotomus) is of smaller width and more subtle in thinning.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 And it (Alnsil) meets for leeching (phlebotomy) of fine veins which contain subtle yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 Chapter on Phlebotomy (Basilica).
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 But the basilica which is one of these three veins' leeching (phlebotomy) is beneficial.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it draws blood from the ailments which are under the throat and neck, following the chest, and the stomach; and it is beneficial for leeching (phlebotomy) to the phlebotomist with the phlebotome, so that he may beware of it and be above fear, because below it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If therefore the leech (phlebotomus) misses and adds in the prick of the phlebotome, it will cut that artery and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore, the leech (phlebotomus) should not prick it with the phlebotome; rather, it should cut it with Alnsil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the basilica does not appear with a manifest appearance, then it is necessary to search for another one, or exchange it for another, or seek a branch of it; or use a cord of the arm in place of (the phlebotome).
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 The thing itself is obvious; cut it open with Phlebotomus Anesil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If you wish for the phlebotomy of this same thing, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the place until you recognize the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark the place with pitch, afterwards arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with Phlebotomus Alnesil, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And beware that the blow does not fall into the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see, as you tie the bandage, swelling at the place which you marked with pitch, then that swelling is swelling of the artery; avoid it therefore.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood at the phlebotomy rising, like urine in a boy, and it is subtle, red: then you shall know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Therefore, approach, and put your finger on it at a long space, afterwards withdraw your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If blood is cut (for it is often cut), then tie the arm, and let it be; and let the weak avoid its movement; and beware of its dread.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move it for a few days until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 If blood is not cut and binds you: and if medicine is not present at your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its ends contract and blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of a fig tree, and boil it; take one half-part, and tie it on the spot where the vein is constricted with a bandage and powder until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	If not (the case): then care for the same person along with him, remembering the place of the dust causing bleeding flow from the previous one. And the removal of his blood is not difficult in many positions, due to the small size of the wound, and the possibility of tying it from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 Book on the Venous Phlebotomy (The Black Vein).
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The phlebotomy of the Black Veins is beneficial because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower body; this is because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it is fitting for the phlebotomist to take care that this vein should be above fear of the phlebotomy, since a nerve is beneath it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 If then the phlebotomist adds (blood) during the incision and finds a nerve, it results in numbness, and difficult is its healing, and perhaps it will not be healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears to the touch.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 If it is hidden in some people and is subtle and does not show itself; then you must place your phlebotomy where the incision of Alnsil is, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 Book on the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The phlebotomy of the Cephalic Vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and contributes to eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And in this vein it is appropriate, if you wish, for the phlebotomist to anoint it with olive oil or myrtle when pricking it; because it is more secure than all veins, because there is no artery beneath it nor nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 It is fitting for you at phlebotomy that you ask the barber only the head of the arm, and seek a more gentle place: it does not harm him if it is not found with the first strike, so repeat upon it with phlebotomy several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 Perhaps an abscess may occur in some men when it is not bled at the first strike, but it does not harm the abscess in some.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 Chapter on the utility of phlebotomy and the precautions to be observed.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The quality of phlebotomy and its occurrences from which it needs to be corrected should be considered by you.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 Firstly, you must know that phlebotomy is not administered unless for the conservation of health, and the persistence of this, and caution against the advent of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And phlebotomy is to be made in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the Cephalica, the Fusca, and the Basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And phlebotomy is to be made at the beginning of spring after fasting, in summer and autumn, and during winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 Phlebotomy is to be made on the first or third day, after three hours have passed from the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 However, phlebotomy administered in illnesses does not have a fixed hour: but when it is appropriate and necessary for that, it can be done at night or day, and at any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 It is not fitting to bleed boys until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 A pregnant woman should not be bled except from the fourth month until the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Old men who have already passed sixty years should not be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 If anyone wishes to be bled for any reason whatsoever, it is necessary that he purifies his intestines before bleeding, if there is much fecal retention within them: so that during bleeding, the putrid superfluities from the intestines do not attract and harm the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 The patient should not be bled when he has gluttony (toctina), that is, satiety or nausea: nor if drunk, nor still hungover from drunkenness, until that has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 Nor a sick person with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 And take care that bleeding is not repeated after an attack of colic, vomiting, diarrhea, increase in sexual activity, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting or any other thing that weakens the body's strength from a material or animal source.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider in finesse the state of the humors before that (the bleeding), if the blood is thick due to foods and drinks, and medicines: if possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then let a bath be entered, unless there is something preventing it: or exercise in some way, so that the blood may become finer.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And place the bleeding of that person in the chest on the third day, as we have said: and strive to evacuate his chest that same day from all bad animal incidents such as anxiety, anger, fear: and from all bodily incidents such as labor, punishment, superfluity and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let him have present those things that are customary for mankind to use from aromatics, fragrances, music and similar things, in the amount possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the blood-letter sit on a raised stool higher than the bed for bleeding: afterwards, he shall draw out his arm and rub it with his own hand twice or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then tie the ligament with a suture, and roll it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the compression be even, because when the compression is uneven, either through excess in the compression, then it prevents the flow of blood; or through loosening, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after the compression, it is necessary for the one who performs bloodletting to rub his hands together until the veins swell and become palpable.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then the person who performs bloodletting cleans the place of bloodletting with a little oil, using an old and appropriate tool.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then he places his index finger of the left hand over the vein at the place where he wants to perform bloodletting, slightly above it; so that the vein does not flee and the blow is cushioned.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Because veins are like running strings at the place of bloodletting; and some are full of wind; and when you place a bloodletter over it, it contracts under the bloodletter, and the bloodletter is deceived, and does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is compressed; therefore, for this reason, the bloodletter must firm his grip, and be attentive to all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then place the bloodletter down.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If then the vein is opened from one side, it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then repeat it on the other side at that place slightly below or above it with haste; if the spot is not pierced.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If it is pierced or the weak person shrinks back in fear, then dismiss him for a day or two; and do not tie the ligament.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Perhaps an abscess attracts heat.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Do not enter the bathhouse.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then repeat the bloodletting if it is necessary.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small or blood flows thinly; and you fear that not enough blood will flow out; then repeat the bloodletting in the same place correctly, and increase the procedure slightly.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 Make it quickly before removing the location, for the location to be removed is in many people during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If therefore you see it already removed, then do not go over it at all, for it does not excuse anything from you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And place something made of oil on top of it: because it softens the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 Similarly administer oil paste in every phlebotomy of yours, where you cut veins against the flow of blood; and they do it with Tyrian alfarach and sagzenea when placed on a spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 For the blood is thinned and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If it happens in the place of phlebotomy that a large abscess occurs, which often happens, especially to him who is not a phlebotomist except for that time, or if it is an opening of small vein, then hurry and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated slightly; and squeeze it once an hour: because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And it is necessary that you do this after the blood exits from the vein itself when it has completed its course, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If something remains in the place after several days that is black or greenish, it does not harm it; and if you wish, place on top of it something of aloes, or myrrh dissolved; or something from the juice of mint, that is, camphor or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And abscesses and swellings often occur at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Therefore place your hand on it, then if you find softness under your pressure on it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Be careful so that you place something on it from what I said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 Perhaps blood from the artery will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 Make an ointment for it with that where there is a hardening, so that the place becomes firm.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 And it is necessary to draw out every man's blood according to the quantity of its power.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And what appears as a purple color appearing on top of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 If the blood is black, then allow it to come out until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, then allow it to become thin; and similarly if it is sharp, then allow its sharpness to disappear.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 And it is necessary for the one who is full, strong, and requires bloodletting once, that the venesection of the vein be amplified, and the venesector be on the side; and for the one who is weak, it should be the opposite of this.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 And it is necessary to draw it out from the veins, and that the hole be narrow; and it is better for the venesection of the vein that the incision be transverse rather than puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 And this method of venesection is safe from bleeding and from the cutting of nerves; and it is more praiseworthy and safer than venesection by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 And for one who often comes to venesection due to fainting, it is necessary to eat before venesection with a small piece of bread soaked in water infused with dates or pomegranate; or to drink if he is heated up; and draw blood from him in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 And if it is a cold constitution, then before venesection let him eat bread soaked in syrup of honey or in aromatic syrup with spices, or in aromatic scented syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If it happens that fainting occurs during bloodletting and the cause is abundant bleeding, then it is necessary that water of flesh be taken for drink, and a subtle perfumed syrup; and it should be used with aromatics along with alum and the chest should be wrapped with it; and the remedies mentioned in the chapter on fainting due to evacuation should also be used.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 Whoever wishes to cut his arm and let out his blood in the second way: it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is due to excessive evacuation, and the strength of his blood is weak, that he lets out blood gradually by the quantity of its strength over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 Whoever wishes to cut his arm and let out his blood in the second way, and is perhaps weak: then he should do it after seven or nine hours following his first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side on which it falls: it is necessary for him that it be done on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 In whose body blood is already very hot and sharpens, causing fever: it is necessary that the blood exit from him on one occasion, and a large quantity be drawn out; and the opening should be increased until fainting occurs: after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and so that you place your hand on his pulse at the course of the blood, lest death occur in its place where fainting does.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 For it often happens when the bloodletter is ignorant and falls through negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 And it is not necessary when one wishes to cut the arm and let out blood in the second way, if the opening of the vein is already closed and the exit of the blood becomes difficult, that pressure be applied violently to it and it be quickly stretched open.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 It is very bad, rather let it be, until it is bled a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Remove with sharpness the clot that is formed from blood in the vein opening, and place something of dissolved salt on it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 And place upon it some tyriaca alfaroch or sagzenea, and press it gently until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 But if the vein has already been cut (or lanced), then let it be, and do not cover it up, until the boil settles down.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 If there is need to draw blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either bleed the same place or in another vein of the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The arm is bled at the place of Fusca and Basilica, when they are not found and hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the quality of the bleeding is that a weak person should insert his hand into warm water until it turns red, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then bind over it with a bandage not too tightly.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then bleed it across (transversely), gradually and not lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and your bleeding there should be only a small one on the junction of the hands.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 If the flow of blood is prevented, then immerse your hand in warm water again, and let the blood flow into the water until you have satisfied your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 But if you are in the days of summer, then excuse yourself from immersing your hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 And most importantly, the flow of blood into warm water is put during winter time.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And this vein's bleeding is safer than all the others because it is not a pulsating vein nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 Phlebotomy for the hand (Salvatella) of the right side, is useful for the diseases of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 The quality of phlebotomy (for the hand) is that you tie off (the vein of) the hand with a ligature or with your hand, after introducing it into warm water, until the vein becomes inflamed and it is strongly felt.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then make an incision (across) the phlebotomy (vein).
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 If you cut it completely, it will not harm him at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 And be careful, lest you amputate the hand with the phlebotomy (vein).
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For under that are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then put the hand again into warm water and let the blood flow out there.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not repeat it (putting the hand into warm water), the blood congeals in the opening of the vein and prevents its flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 Therefore, when you have taken out the required amount of blood from the blood, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not quickly coagulate.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, it is necessary that you do this with every tightened branch (vein).
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 However, the aid for this phlebotomy (vein of the left hand) is that it is useful for the diseases of the spleen; and similarly do as you did with the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The aid for the saphenous vein phlebotomy is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as the diseases of the uterus, and retention of menstruation, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and ulcers of the hips (pelvis) and legs old ones, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 The quality of the phlebotomy for the saphenous vein is that a sick person should introduce his foot into warm water; and he shall make friction on it until the veins become swollen, and tie above the ankle with thongs.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 The location of the vein is at the heel, appearing towards the thumb; and branches from it, on the face of the foot, many branches.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore, the vein should be tapped at its larger branch or at the heel where it collects; since it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If one were to tap the vein on the sole of the foot, then take care to avoid the nerves that are below it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 And place your lancet for tapping the vein across it, as if you were going to cut it; and let the tapper be named Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If there is a prohibition of blood flow, then immerse his foot in warm water; and release the blood to run into it until it has drained out.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the tapper misses the vein in the first attempt, then he should return with the lancet to the upper part, for it is safe and there is no harm, as long as you are careful of the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And likewise, with the Saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The location of the Sciatic vein, as we have said, is at the heel from the forest side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 And the aid for this tapper is, in pain of the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 And the quality of this tapper is that he should enter the bath when sick and hurry; and bind his leg from the side of the ankle to above the heel with a thin, long plaster; for it does not appear unless for that reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When it appears, then tap the vein according to whatever skill is possible for you; or across it; and it is better, either that you cut it with an incision, or sever it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 The place [of the ailment] is very harmful, and it is hidden in many people to a great degree.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you do not find it [the ailment] and it does not appear to the senses at all: then make an incision of the vein in that place, and it is the one that appears on the back of the foot and turned towards the ear; be careful not to cut nerves, and let the amount of blood flow that you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then dissolve the narrowing [of the vein], and place skin over the place of the incision, and tighten the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 It is cured quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 On Ventosation, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 They [ventoses] are made from horns, copper, and glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And ventosation is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With scarification and bloodletting; the other is ventosation without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this ventosation which is without scarification, is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the places on the body where ventosation with scarification and bloodletting are administered are fourteen.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 One of them is the ventosation of Alnocrates, and it is at the back of the head; Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; ventosation of Alhagdahim, and they are two plates on the neck from both sides; ventosation of the brain, and it is under the lower jaw on the inside of the mouth; ventosation of two spoons; ventosation of Alachosos above the end of the tail; ventosation of two nails, and they are in the middle of the arms; ventosation of two legs; ventosation of two ankles.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And ventosation does not extract blood from the veins scattered throughout the flesh, and for that reason, it does not have the same effectiveness as in phlebotomy (bloodletting).
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It is not necessary to administer fumigation or with fire, nor without fire for any illness caused by congestion, until the entire body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity arises due to illness or custom for fumigation, it is administered at the beginning, end, and middle of each month, and at any time whenever necessary.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 Because there are people who, when their blood multiplies, find a heaviness and swelling in the head, and a sore throat.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And from these people there are some who find congestion and redness on their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And from these people there are some who find itching on their face and forehead, darkness, and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And from these people there are some who scratch the place of their fumigation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And from these people there is one whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And from these people there is one who finds a taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue is scraped and the blood is spitted out.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And from these people there is one whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And from these people there is one who sees blood and redness, dead people, wounds, and things similar to these in their sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When we see something from these people, especially during the middle of the third month: then we command fumigation to be performed after two or three hours have passed since the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The benefit of fumigation to the neck is: because it relieves heaviness in the head and what drains from it goes to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 But it must be after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And this fumigation is in place of cephalic phlebotomy (bloodletting from the head).
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 It is not permitted to use [it] on one who has a cold constitution, or [on] one who has a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 It causes him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And for this reason, it is not appropriate to use [it] on the elderly and on one who has cold diseases of the head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 He who is constant over it generates forgetfulness in him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And for this reason, you must instruct the Windfinder to lower his hand with the wind for a moment towards the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Windfinding or Alkehel is in place of phlebotomy (Fuscus), and phlebotomy (Basilica), and for this reason it causes coughing, constriction of the breath, panting of the instrument, coughing, and congestion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 It is necessary to press Windfinder Alkehel briefly, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 However, Windfinding Alhagdahim causes accidents of pain in the head, migraines, hemigraine, perforations, and pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is in place of phlebotomy (Basilica).
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And you must instruct the Windfinder not to press his hand during scarification, so as not to cut an artery, and there is bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 However, Windfinding under the chin causes alcohol in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; and it is in place of phlebotomy elsewhere, which are at the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 However, Windfinding with a spatula causes alchafacha, which is caused by flexion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 However, Windfinding of the internal parts of two forks causes help for phlebotomy of the three veins (Basilica, Fuscus, Cephalica); because it draws blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh; and these small veins draw blood from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 It is necessary that you warn the one who lances, not to proceed too much in scarification; because the place is stripped of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and veins.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 The one who ventose (the anal area) applies to hemorrhoids of the anus and to lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 It is necessary that you warn the one who ventose (the anal area) to have a large ventose and made of air; because the place needs strong suction and perhaps the delicate vents break; and it should be incised with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 The diminution of the legs' ventose is evident; because they draw blood from the whole body, and cause old pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; they provoke menstruation, bothor, and ademenul; and stand at the place of phlebotomy for two saphenas and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 Nevertheless they weaken the body much, and cause fainting in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And the help of anal ventose's alhorcobeni is near the help of anal ventose of two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the position of ventose is that you put the ventose first in an empty place and suck with moderate suction; and do not prolong the position of the ventose, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that humors come to the place at equal arrival; and do not stop doing this and continuing until you see the place already red and swollen, and the redness appears as blood; then scarify, and repeat suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider in the arrangement of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For the one who is among men has tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary that you incise him once, not more; so that the place does not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And instruct the Ventosator to enlarge the scarification and make it shallow; and regulate the suction in ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is thickening in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 In the first incision, an opening is made for the subtlety of the blood and its thinning; and in the second examination of the detailed extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If the blood is extremely foul, then the scarification should be made for a third time; to follow what comes last.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And when we wish to draw out blood little by little or in small quantity, one scarification is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we want the extraction of much blood, we shall make many scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick; then it is necessary to scarify with deep scarifications; and the end equal in scarification, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 What is that which should be applied from the oils for the position of the Ventosator, and what the cautions are for the one who blows.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In the one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and the pores of which are closed, it is necessary to anoint the places for blowing with oils that are opening, softening, resolving; if it is in summer, such as alkali oil or volatile oil or sweet almond oil or cucumber seed oil.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 If it is winter time, then use oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or ointment: and similar things.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If excess is thick and cold, then use oil of amaracis, or oil of balsam, or oil of aloe, or oil of dittany: and similar things.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If the nosebleed is from large pores, of tender flesh: then it is necessary to forbid oil, and it is necessary that they rinse those areas after nosebleeding with rose water, or cold water, or salt water, or water of pumpkin, or water of purslane: and similar things.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 He whose blood is of much moisture, rinse the nosebleed areas with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and sumac: and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 He whose excesses are thick, rinse the nosebleed areas with old wine, or with water of sage, or decoction of dittany, or chamomile: and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 It is necessary to avoid nosebleed in the bath, or near the bath, indeed it is necessary to administer it after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 Nor should anyone sleep after a nosebleed.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 Chapter on: What is required to control nosebleed or phlebotomy before a nosebleed.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And afterwards it is necessary to consider first: if nosebleed or phlebotomy patient is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation prevail over his blood, then it is necessary for him to receive cooling agents, such as grape must: also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and iuleb: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 Place his food for the birds, and roast the flesh of lamb, and prepared foods with vinegar: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 If it has a cold complexion, he should drink syrup made from honey, or almuiya, or asclepias made from seeds; and he should drink moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new; and it is prescribed that he should eat sparingly.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 Put his food for the birds, and roast them; and passers, that is, small birds; and he should throw out the young pigeons.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 It is necessary that the drink on the day of venesection and phlebotomy should be more than the food; and it is necessary to give in the drink in some people at times tyriaca alfaroch, or medicine from musk, that is, muscatel, or alexiseth before venesection; and before or after: so that the main limbs are strengthened, and the blood is made thin.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 And it is not necessary to drink it in heated (drink).
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Chapter on Venesection without Scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 Venesections that are without scarification are those placed on the liver, spleen, podagra, on the abdomen, umbilicus, and places of kidneys, and ankles; because these members do not endure scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 Nor does it seek through these (veins), unless an attraction of blood from one member to another; as we place the venesection on the breasts in disease of the flow of blood in the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to remove the venosity of an unpleasant cold in the limb; as we place the venesection on the abdomen and umbilicus.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For it makes the limb rare, and warms it up, and removes pain for this reason, because it has resolved that venosity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 Also placed over the kidneys when occur there abscess or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 By its virtue of attraction perhaps it opens an abscess, or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly when it is placed over the spleen, and on both sides for the shaking of the liver or spleen due to wind.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 These shakings are administered empty when there is just cutting.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes they are administered filled with warm water in cases of pleurisy: and that is to fill the Shaking, and it should be large, warm water alone, or water in which cooked herbs are steeped that agree.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 Form of the Shaking administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 The width of its opening should be two fingers apart, as we have determined; and the depth should be half a palm; and on one side there should be a small hole, according to what size the needle enters it; it should be made of copper or citrine, smooth, equal edges, polished; so that it does not harm the body while placed on top of it; and there should be a transverse bar across it in the middle, made of iron or wood, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now this Shaking is made large, larger than we have described, and not much smaller than that, according to the sickness and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 The Shakings for children and weak ones are different from those for men and large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of placing this Shaking with fire on a body is to burn linen with fire properly, or a small candle from wax; and place it on the middle bar that is in the middle of the Shaking; so that the fire is lit near the lower part of the Shaking, not to burn the weak body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then let it be placed on the limb, and a finger should be over the hole that I mentioned, until when we hold the abscess; while we need, remove the finger, and the abscess will exit through the hole, and the abscess will immediately burst.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then let the linen be heated according to its manner, and repeat it if necessary.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 In the abscess applied to the disease of pleurisy with water, there is no rod [or probe] crossed, nor hole; it is not given except because it is filled with water and placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And this abscess, the larger it is, so that it can hold much water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 Chapter on Suspension of Sugar-of-Lead.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Chapter CXIX. Sanguisugae are not given in many cases except where the position of abscesses is not possible due to their smallness, such as lips, gums, and similar places.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or on a bare member, such as a finger, and nose, and similar places.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the quality of using them is: that you come from Sanguisugas which are in sweet, clean waters, free from decay.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they should be released day and night into sweet water until they are hungry, and there remains nothing inside them.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Then the body is evacuated first with phlebotomy, and with abscesses.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then wash the sick member until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Afterwards, they are placed upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are filled and fall out, and it is possible to suck the place with an abscess, then it is more helpful for treatment; and if not, then clean the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then with much water, it is rubbed, and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the course of blood persists after a bleeding, and it is oozing: then immerse a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top until the oozing stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If the bleeding is abundant, then sprinkle powdered zechium (a type of alum), or gallnuts, or similar substances from the styptic plants upon it until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or place half-peeled beans on the location and let them remain until they stick to the area, as the bleeding will stop.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And if it is necessary to repeat the bleeding (bleeding the patient again), it is advisable to change them whenever possible.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 If bleeding is forbidden by suspension (a practice where a tourniquet was used to stop the blood flow), then clean the site with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or insert a lance into the sites until something comes out from the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then place them (the instruments), for when they feel something coming from the blood, they will stick immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When you want them to fall (the clots), sprinkle something from crushed aloes, salt or ashes over them and they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 End of the second part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Third Part.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 Universal discourse on the restoration, dislocation, and treatment of twists, and similar conditions.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine and it is the restoration of broken bones and dislocations that occur in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know that the foolish doctors and common people boast about this chapter and those who have never examined an ancient book or read a single letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And because of this reason, the method is rare among our scholars on earth.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have never encountered a good example of this method and I have not acquired that knowledge from it except for the length of reading ancient books and my dedication to understanding them until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I attach myself by experience and study to the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 And now I have described to you in this Chapter everything that contains my knowledge: and beyond what my experience has passed, after I have abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation, and shown it at the end of declination: and I have formed many shapes in it from the shapes of the instruments that are administered in it, as I did in two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 The sums and collections of the fractures of bones, from those whose premise is necessary before we begin the remembrance of the fractured members, and various ones, if of each one.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this Chapter, the sums and chapters, to whose understanding the craftsman must be guided firstly on the truth of them: namely, so that you, and those prompt, may know or learn this noble art from it, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 I say therefore, that when a fracture or dislocation or twisting or falling happens to someone, then it is necessary that you rush firstly to bleed him, and to dissolve himself, or both at the same time: if something does not prevent it, such as weakness of virtue; or it is he who has happened something of these things, a boy or an old man worn out; or it is a time of violent heat, or very violent cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then he should be content with his food, cold vegetables, and the flesh of beans and lentils; and forbid wine, thick meats, and to be filled from foods and every food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are secure from a hot abscess and no longer fear the outflow of matter to the member, then let the sick return to their first regimen with which their custom was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the fractured bone begins to heal, then it is necessary that the sick be fed with nutritious food in great quantity, thick, heavy, which contains viscosity; such as food made from boiled wheat and water, rice, heads of cattle, feet, abdomens of sheep, eggs, fresh fish, thick wine and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 For this diet makes the coagulation of the fracture quicker and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And you should know that fractured bones, when they are in men who are in the first old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be held together and consolidated according to their nature always, due to the drying out of their limbs; and they are consolidated and held together which come from them at the end of softness, like bones of small boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 Nevertheless, nature connects something similar to a glue around the fractured bone from all sides, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and tightens it until they are conglutinated on both sides, and bound together until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until it does not prohibit anything from its operations; and for this reason it is necessary that you place nutriment for the sick food which has thickness, viscosity and heaviness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And you should know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of limbs; since a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the backbone; and similarly all other limbs are diverse among themselves; and I come with the reminder of every species of fractures explained in its own chapter.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 The species of bone fracture are also diversified within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Since the fracture is bow-shaped, there are also stellate occurrences in it. (In this context "stellate" refers to a star-like pattern or configuration.)
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes the fracture occurs along the length of the bone; and these are its stellate or star-like fractures, and extensions proceeding, just as they are in a reed, when it is cut with a knife for writing purposes. (In this context "stellate" refers to a star-like pattern or configuration.)
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not proceeding; and there is a fracture with wound and disruption at the head, and there is a small crack fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And every species has a skill or its own specific tool for its restoration, according to how it will be remembered, distinguished in their respective places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from that which the bone fracture is known, there is its tortuosity and elevation; and its appearance to the sense, and the sound it makes when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When therefore there is no tortuosity appearing in the place, nor a sound when you touch the bone with movement, nor does it produce a great pain; then there is no fracture there, indeed it may be a tortuosity or a small crack; therefore you should not move it with your hand and compression at all, instead put medicines on top of it, according to how it will be remembered, after a suitable time: then it is strained by a ligature made finely. (In this context, "ligature" refers to a medical bandage or suture used for binding wounds together.)
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And know that a place becomes arched and is split into two, except there are stellate occurrences in it; however, all parts should be moved away from their comparison: then you must begin from your hour for its correction, equalizing it before a hot abscess occurs to it. (In this context "stellate" refers to a star-like pattern or configuration.)
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If a boil occurs warm, then let it be left for some days until the boil subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then cut (the boil) according to whatever method can be done with kindness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that the healing (of the wound) and its setting (in order), is easier than of a bone, in which there are fractures.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then suture it, according to what comes to your mind regarding its healing.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If there are fractures in the bone, then it is necessary to stretch this broken limb by two parts, whether it be a hand or a foot; or with your hand, if the member is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 Let the position you place the limb on be equal to its natural shape on a flat surface, until the parts of the broken limb extend; then try with all your skill and in any way possible to bring back these additions (to their places); and be careful according to your strength so that no pain or injury occurs due to your operation, nor damage; and try according to your strength to apply one bone to its companion, according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 And it is necessary that you try and touch it with your hand at that hour.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If you see something irregular there, correct it, and set (the bone) straight according to your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And avoid violent extension and strong compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For often they make a boil occur due to their operation, or contraction in the limb; as we have already seen from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then bind (the limb) after the setting, and a proper operation, and a tightening of the member, and quiet, and calm; and warn the patient about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 The translation of the given Latin sentence is: "And make him take care not to move it during his hours of sleep, and his sleep, and his restlessness, and during his digestion, and all its movements with utmost strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 "And let him take care that the position of the member which follows pain is not maintained.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 "What is meant by this, is that when it feels pain or injury in the position of a member, then it must be moved to another position from which it does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 "And let him take care that his position is even and straight so that no deformity occurs in the member when it is being restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 "And the quality of the immobilization of a fractured member, as I have said.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 "Know that fractured members are classified according to their size, dimension, and shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 "Those which are small such as the arm, finger, club foot, and similar, then it should be wrapped in a soft, fine fabric.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 "But those which are large such as the thigh and leg, there should be a wide, hard wrapping.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 "Because a broad bandage unites a large member and compresses it equally from all sides with an equal immobilization so that no mark penetrates.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 "Then begin to apply a suitable ointment after evacuation on the equal part, on a soft cotton over the location of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 "Then begin to wrap the bandage over the location of the fracture with three or four layers, depending on the member's deserving, and tighten your hand slightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 "Then go with him to the upper part from the location of the fracture and loosen less than your previous immobilization on the fractured location.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then prolong yourself slightly with a slight rotation from the place of the fracture, and gradually soften the constriction until you seize a large amount from a healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another poultice and apply it again over the broken place with repeated rotations.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Go downwards, with a slight rotation, to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And make your operation in the constriction of the rotation and its softening, according to what we said in the first rotation above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then put between the rotations (bandages) of soft wool or cloth, which matches the curvature of the fracture, if there is a curvature in it; and if not, do not place anything on it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then apply another poultice over it (the bandages).
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Then place equal stars (small poultices) evenly over these rotations, immediately if there is no swelling or a hot abscess in the area.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 If there is swelling or an abscess in the area; then place over it what sits on that abscess and removes the swelling; and let it be for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then bind over these small poultices (stars).
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 And let the small poultices (stars) be from the middle parts of wide reeds, shaved and wisely formed; or they can be from wood where sieves are made, which are made from pine, yew, palm branches, or calingi; and let the width of all the poultices be according to this form and this same shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, it is necessary that the poultice placed over the fracture be slightly larger and wider than the others; and the length of the poultice should be according to what is suitable for the limb in size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then bind over the poultices with another poultice, according to the first constriction (bandage).
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then bind above with threads properly, as we have said regarding the stricture: and it is, that your stricture be over the place of the fracture more: and as it is more elongated from the fracture, the stricture is lesser.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 It is necessary that the threads be of a medium size and fineness, and be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 Since if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the operation of foolish ones placing their threads from twisted cords of coarse linen, it is a great mistake: since the stricture falls with them out of quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And fine threads again do not fit: since you will not achieve with the stricture what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 It is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth between the awl and the awl.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If the weak one is hurt by the tips of the awls after the stricture in healthy places: then place under them with wool felt or carded wool, until nothing is hurt from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 When there is a fracture with a wound, and it happens that the break occurs in the skin, I will come with the reminder of this in the second chapter concerning special cases.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every fractured member needs to be bound with awls from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 Because when the member is large, it is not necessary to place upper awls on it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the risk of a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is the method of plasters, which the ancients placed on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	¶ Common method of plasters abbreviated, restoring the fracture, suitable for multiple constitutions, especially women and children: since it is from that which heat does not conquer nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is to receive from the flour mill powder, and it is the marrow of the wheat that hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the millstone: and make it as follows, except you sift it with egg white: and place the mixture of it not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another method of plaster (bandage), for setting a fracture, dislocation and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Prepare almess, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath; and boil all of them with 10 parts of myrrh, 5 parts of each aloes, and 20 parts of alethil. Let everything be ground and sifted, then mix it with water of alethil or with sheep's milk white if the bandage is heated for a sick person.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this plaster (bandage).
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is of good composition, quickly sets broken bones and helps many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method of plaster (bandage), which also helps with a fracture and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Prepare mugath, mess, white alteae, all with 10 parts of myrrh, 5 parts of each aloes, 6 parts of acacia, and 20 parts of ground Armenian pitch. Let everything be ground well and sifted, then boil it with water or sheep's milk white, and administer (the mixture).
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Another method of plaster (bandage) for joints and bones separated from their places; it relieves pain and swelling, and heals a broken bone.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Wool grease is collected, immersed in vinegar and boiled oil; it is placed on the location.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 And indeed, there is no virtue of healing in this plaster (bandage), but it is good for the healing of hot abscesses; and it expels pain specifically.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Another method of plaster (bandage) that sets a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take the leaves of wild fig and the leaves of silvestrous papaver; grind them all and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Another method of shortened plaster (bandage), administered for the healing of a broken bone; and when you want the removal of the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Prepare a mixture of the root of the marshmallow plant (altheae), chamomile, herb violet flowers, and barley flour, all in equal parts: grind them all and mix them with wine, if the affected member is not already heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If the affected member is already heated, then prepare it with water from moist coriander seeds, or simply use this preparation.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another stronger method of plaster for resolution, stronger than the first, when there is a hard abscess during restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Prepare a mixture of the root of marshmallow plant (altheae), flax seeds, beechwood resin, licorice, sesame seeds, asafetida, violet flowers and chamomile, all in equal parts: grind them all and mix with water of willow, sweet water or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 Apply this preparation to the affected member according to its heat and the calmness of the heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates did not say in his book to apply on a broken member during its restoration unless it is made of beeswax and oil; he does not mention anything else, and he said that it should be between coarseness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galenus saw it fit that substances with a heating property be applied on a broken member during its restoration, such as myrrh, aloes, frankincense and similar ones from the substances mentioned earlier.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 Another plaster method for injuries and pain relief.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Prepare a mixture of mugwort, chickpeas, human hair (either cut or feathers of birds), marshmallow root and salt in equal parts: grind and sift it, and make plaster out of this mixture.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The amount that should remain tied (the ligature) is as follows: consider if there is no pain or itching, or the bone does not move from its place; if so, do not untie it for several days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If it happens to him at the place of itching intensely, or distressing pain, or swelling: then hurry up and dissolve it within an hour, and remove the plaster from him; and take a soft cloth or a soft sea sponge, moist; and immerse it in warm water, and wash the place with it until the itching ceases and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then let the member rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place on it a soft woolen cloth, immersed in vinegar and oil, or rose oil; and bind over it at night until you are safe from hot infection, and the swelling of the member subsides, and the pain disappears.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat on it a subtle bandage and small plaster; do not bind it with your first compression and fine ones, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling and all the other occurrences have been removed entirely, and you need plaster and bandage, then repeat it as you did at first, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing of what we mentioned happens to the member, then do not dissolve it before three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is released after twenty days, according to what you see from the dissolution of the member as we said, until a fracture adheres and coagulation of flesh grows over it: add also at that time more than your first bandage in the bandage; and add also in the thickening of food, according to what was previously remembered.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 If you see that the place of the fracture is already drying out and thinning more than necessary: then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Heat the embrocation with warm water in every place where you dissolve it, and let it be in all three days, and apply a ligature slightly.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 Through this operation, nourishment flows to the member, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 But what the foolish restorers do in place of fractured members when it is not first restored as required, and it is restored according to a curve, is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it were correct, they would have said this in their ancient books, and operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I never saw any trace of them [the error] in this at all, and it is better not to do that.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 Chapter on the making of a fracture in the head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 The types of fractures are various, and their shapes are numerous; and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For a fracture is that which occurs by striking with a sword: and striking removes the bone to the extent it reaches the syphac (which is under the bone), just as an axe does in wood: and for this reason, this type of fracture is called an Axial fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or the sword cuts something of the bone and cuts its face, but does not cut through with the incision to the end of it: and this type of fracture is called a Calaan (meaning an Absolute Lifting).
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And there are two types of wounds, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And from a fracture is one which is crushed or rubbed: and the cause of this is a blow with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this fracture is also one that penetrates and approaches the pannicle (which is under the bone): or it is on the face of the bone: and this type of wound is also among those two types, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And from a break is that which is hidden within the bone in the subtlety of hair; and it is a small fissure, and because of this it is called this kind of fracture Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And from these (things) is a fracture that happens from an accident or impact of a stone and similar things which cause a lamina of the bone to enter within; and it makes a hollow place: just as it happens to the bellows of air, when they are struck, and part of them enters within.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 And indeed, this (kind of fracture) is most often found in the moist bones of the head, such as those of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And all these kinds of fractures (are accompanied by) swelling and separation; and I shall return with a reminder of the whole in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 And we know all these kinds of fractures by the examination of them and investigation with probes, and removal of rotten flesh that is on top of them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 The Capillary kind (of fracture) is recognized by this, that it appears on the bone, and is scraped away, and a ligature is applied on top of it with pitch: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the condition of the patient; then if you see that there are indications of illness from the accidents (symptoms) themselves, as in cholera vomiting, extension, loss of intellect, loss of voice, fainting, fever, eye discharge or redness, similar symptoms in other disorders, it will certainly not heal: and if you see the patient's condition is not terrifying and you hope for recovery; then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 If someone comes to you with a wound, and it is a fracture, it is during the winter days; then it is necessary that you study its excision (removal of bone) before the fourteenth day according to every situation.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 If it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it becomes rotten under the bone from the fat, and such accidents occur as we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 If the fracture of the bone has already reached the fat touching the brain, and is with particles and traction: then it is necessary that you cut the fractured and smoothed part, according to what I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 It is necessary that you shave the head of the wounded: and bore into the bone according to whatever method is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light on the weak.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If while boring into the bone there comes a flow of blood or a hot abscess: then oppose it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 It is necessary that you fill the place with soaked rags in wine and rose oil: and let the wound rest until the abscess settles, and be secure from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin in the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 One method is that you cut the bone with a sharp chisel: and this is its shape.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then administer another chisel wider than the first: and this is its shape.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then administer yet another chisel wider still.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 And the second method is that you have a number of chisels of different sizes; some of which are wider than others, and some shorter than others: and they should be at the end of their sharpness, and made from iron or steel: and use them with ease when striking the chisel, so as not to strike the head, and hurt it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If the bone is hard and firm: then it is necessary that you bore around its circumference before you administer Incision, with Terebris which are called Terebras, not penetrating too deeply; and they are not named thus, except because they do not pass beyond the bone's meaty limit to that which is behind it; for this reason, because the Terebrum has a rounded extremity above what is beneath its head and a sharp point below, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents immersion, and passing through the bone's thickness.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 It is necessary for you to take a large number of these Terebris, one of which should correspond to the thickness of the bone; until the present is to you all the Terebrum of the skull; whose sharp edge's length and width should be according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three kinds of Terebris or Trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of boring around the bone that is broken, is: you place the Terebrum on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then change the Terebrum to another place and place what is between every hole of the same thickness as a radius, or approximately so.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with Incision what is between every hole from the bone; and do it more delicately than you can above that from the edge of thinness, as we have said, until you root out the bone, either with your hand or with some other instruments which you have prepared for that purpose: such as tenaliae and delicate forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And it is necessary to take care with every caution that the Terebrum or Incision does not touch anything from the siphac.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When you are boring around the bone and it is separated from the siphac, if it is continuous with it and you extract it, it is necessary to root, and cut off an equal end of what remains in the bone with another similar instrument, like the Incision.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 It is necessary that it (the instrument) be thin and delicate more than other incising instruments.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If something remains of small bones and cartilage: then take it easily with what you have at hand from your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then care for the wound after that with linen strips, and ointments as I said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 Another method of operation is easy, completely remote from fear; which Galen said, and praised greatly; and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 You first must begin to expose the bone fragment from the place where the fracture is more severe and more noticeable; until you have exposed that part, and placed under it the end of this concave incising instrument, which has this shape.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 The concave part does not cut anything; the sharp part of it on its two sides going along in length, as you see; so that the concave part be attached to the splint, the face of which the sharp part incises into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike on the incising instrument from one side with a small hammer, until you cut through the entire bone easily, as it turns; and be careful that no cloth accidentally falls into it, which you fear entirely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the physician were not more foolish than humans, and less ignorant of his art, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it off with the end of the concave incising instrument, and remove it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 It is freed from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 If the bone fracture does not penetrate to the cloth, and what is cut away from the bone is the face of it, and roughness and delicate cartilage remain in it; then it is necessary that you remove that roughness, and excavate those delicate cartilages with fine rasps, which you have prepared in various quantities, so that it is possible for you to apply more suitable ones in every place, and the ones themselves are straighter, according to what leads you in the operation, and the fractured bone and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 And it is necessary that you administer according to your proportion, firstly cut the bone, more widely than the width of those scrapers.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use (the instrument) after that with a finer one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not cease doing it in continuity until you reach the point of administering thinner and finer than all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 For each of the remaining small cracks and subtle breaks, it is necessary to administer care according to that which leads to its rectification.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And there is a thing that cannot be hidden upon all who have any interest in this art and it stands upon that which we have written and shown for large breaks.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 If however a small piece of skin is found while you are cutting bone: then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another cloth either doubled or tripled and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth: and do that as easily as possible above it, so that it does not become heavy.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then administer above it a wide ligature: and do not tighten it except to the size that holds the wound only: and leave it with this care for one day or two days until you are secure from hot inflammation.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then dissolve it, and administer afterwards medications with which excessive dryness is necessary: such as the roots of lilies, and oat flour, and turpentine resin, and aristolochia, and similar to these: and there is, so that you make a powder from these medicines, which is powdered over the wound like dry ones.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And universally administer in it every medication according to the property of which is to cleanse and not to irritate.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 Be careful according to your virtue, so that the wound may be clean during your treatment: neither should there be dirt from ointment, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 You must not let pus gather on it at all, because when pus gathers on the brain tissue, it corrupts it and makes it rot, and after that a great mischief happens to the sick person: and it has already happened in the head wound, when the bone is cleaned by him, especially when care of it is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Therefore, if what I have said happens to the sick person, know that it is certainly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 If blackness does not happen except from the medicine placed upon it and this medicine is of its nature to cause blackening, then it is necessary that you take one part from honey and three parts from rose oil and wash it with these.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on the wound: afterward take care of it with the remedies suitable for healing until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 Chapter on the repair of a broken nose.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that the nose is not broken except by both of its upper parts together or one of them: therefore, because there are two bones in it, the lower part is cartilaginous and is not broken, nor does anything happen to it except abrasion, curvature, and deviation.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of its two parts is broken, then it is necessary that you insert a small finger into the nose and adjust the broken part with your index finger and thumb on the outside until the nose returns to its natural shape; and this should be done skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And be careful that no pain happens to the sick person during your treatment.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach it with the finger: then it is necessary that the end of the radius be leveled, where there is a small swelling.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If the fracture is in two parts, then make it similar (to what?); and approach with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at a place of warm plasters (apostematis).
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a piece of linen from a linen cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part; or insert two pieces of linen if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be a swelling on the linen of such a size that it fills the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some of the ancient restorers said that linen should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 But that does not seem to me; rather, it should be soaked in egg white, made with flour mill powder.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then release the linen when the bone has hardened and the cartilage has become hard.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a feather of a goose is inserted into the nose where the linen was, once a soft cloth has been laid over it: and this serves to hold the fracture in the nose more strongly and to prevent weak ones from being prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you want, do it; if you want, do the linen.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If it happens again that the nose gets an abscess while working on a warm plaster, apply a nasal embrocation with pitch, or with cotton soaked in rose oil, or a little bit of zinc oxide.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 If no abscess occurs, then it is necessary to apply warm plasters with wheat flour and powdered incense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a soft cloth on top of it (the wound), and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If however the bones of the nose are broken in a small fracture or crushed, then it is necessary that you cut through them and extract them with instruments suitable for the purpose.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then suture (the wound) and take care of it with something that promotes healing, such as appropriate plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If the wound is between the nose, then it is necessary to take care of it with linen and administer a lead cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Chapter on the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	 Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is broken and there is no wound associated with the fracture: examine it then to see if the fracture is only on the outside and not split into two, and curved towards the inside; in this case, recognition of the injury is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert your left index finger into the weak jaw; similarly, if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert your right index finger; and push with it the bulge of the fracture to the inside with ease towards the exterior using your other hand from the inner part of the bone correctly, and with equal pressure.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the fracture of the jaw has already been separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer a traction from both parts according to right angle; until it becomes possible to align them.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 If however it has already occurred that the teeth are displaced or disrupted: then tie them with a gold, silver or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place a compress on the broken jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place a double cloth on the jaw and position a large star-shaped pad made of it centrally over the cloth or an equal piece of sole leather along the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it above, as your ligature for it is prepared, and its application fits well until it does not disintegrate; and command the sick one to be at rest and in peace; and place soft foods for his purges.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 If you deem that something changes in the figure by some means: then hurry, and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then correct what has been altered from it, and plaster it with flour of mill, with egg white, or with wheat flour, after you have removed the soot; and place a soft wool on top of the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While that plaster remains attached to it and the bone arrangement does not change, leave it be until it heals; or tie the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 For this fracture is often tied in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If in the meantime a hot abscess occurs, then administer what I have said many times for its soothing until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if there is a fracture with a wound, be aware of it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 For if the fragment separates from the bone or a tendon, then be subtle in this matter so that you remove those fragments of the tendon together with what suits you for their removal using your instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If the opening of the wound is narrowed, then enlarge it with a leech according to the amount needed for your purposes.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you remove the tendon and nothing remains of it, or if the opening of the wound is wide: and if not, place on it plasters that suit for this purpose, and let it heal until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 Chapter on the repair of a Fork, when it breaks.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 The most common break of a Fork occurs from the front part of the shoulder blade, and its fracture is made in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 For it is broken and separated into two, except that there occur in it pustules: and it is easier for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 For such as occur in the bone, pustules: and it is difficult for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 For such as is a break with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the operation in it when there is a break without a wound, is that you make present two servants, one of whom holds the aid following the broken beam, and the other stretches the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then with your fingers make equal the break until its form is made, according to what is necessary; and there is not a projection or a hollow in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If you need more extension, then it is necessary that you put under the small of the sick person a ball made from cloth or wool; and its size should be according to your necessity; and stretch, raise, and press the ball with your hand until you make equal the break, according to what is necessary.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you cannot pull the end of the beam outwards because it has come to a depth; then the sick person must lie down on his neck; and put under his shoulder a small board in size, and press the servant's shoulder towards below until the bone of the beam which is in the depth is raised upwards; and then straighten the break, and make equal it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If however you feel a pustule from the beam and it moves; then it is necessary that you pierce it over it, and draw out the pustule with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If however it is retained in the bone; then you make an opening in its incision with one of the cutters which you have prepared for that purpose, after you put under the beam the instrument which protects the saw-horse; and the instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It is to be assimilated to a snail shell without concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And let its width be according to that which you need for it in proportion to the size of the bone and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 The length [of it] also, as far as possible for you, for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And it should have two ends, as you see; and one end shall be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If however the wound which you cut when you extracted the splinter of bone is wide, and it gapes open; and there is no adhesion from hot cautery; then collect two lips of the wound with suturing.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the wound is small, or you fear hot cautery; then fill the wound with cloths, and with wool according to the size of the wound incision.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If it happens that hot cautery occurs, then soak the cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and put it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 But the suture of a bone without wound and without cutting is, that you place on it an ointment made from milled flour with white egg yolk.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And place soft wax over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place a sphere under the fracture if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take a hematic, that is, the wheel which the Arabs hold, which should be very long; and its width should be one palm or approximately that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place folded wool over soft wax and ointment.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take a needle from thin wood, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then pass it through the cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then pass the cloth with the needle into the place of the hematic which falls upon the fracture and into the wound.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place the hematic upon the fracture as it is rolled, and pass it over his neck, and under the healthy part and under the sick part; and draw it over every part, and so that the suture holds the fracture tight; and this is what is not hidden from you, and all of it, so that the needle does not remove the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 It is necessary to observe the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 Whenever the bandage becomes soft, and you see the knot moving already, then adjust it, and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the sick person's sleep on his back and put a small pillow under his chin near his sleep for the night, so that when he is awakened, help may be brought to him from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Therefore, dislocate the neck-fracture through elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or bind his arm to his neck and do not loosen the bandage unless it happens at the place arising from itching or swelling, for up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster if you see his face turning towards that [place].
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add some [material] in binding and release it until it is healed and hardened.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 The dislocated neck is bound and supported for as many as 20 days, and sometimes it occurs in fewer than those [days].
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 Chapter on the repair of a fracture in the flat bone (spatula).
Caput VII.	 Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 The Spatula seldom breaks, and at its broad place: and from it, only the edges break off.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When it breaks from there, and breaks within its midst, and is not recognized except by touch: then prepare for its treatment according to the figure of the break.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 Bring it back to its natural shape in every way possible that is within your ability.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place on it a mixture of milled powder with egg white and soft starch, and then cover with a downy cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place on top of it a wide star made from thin wood according to the size of the Spatula or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If there is a hollow under the star for any part of the Spatula, then fill the hollow with soft starch until the star sinks to the same level.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then fix it on top with long alum thread, with suitable tightening and firmness of the star, until it cannot be moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And examine the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever the bandage becomes soft, tighten it, and if the star moves from its place, let it lie weak on its healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And the Spatula is restored within twenty days or twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When this number is completed, then loosen the bandage: and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it is made of bones whose fracture is not feared, nor their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If, however, a bone splinter comes out and pierces under the skin: then cut it off above.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do as we said for the break of a collarbone using a hot poultice, if something happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 Chapter on the restoration of the broken chest.
Caput VIII.	 Head VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 Chest sometimes breaks in the middle, and it happens rarely.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Its extremities break or are fractured more frequently due to their accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When it breaks at its middle, which declines towards the lower parts, and this is accompanied by intense pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, and perhaps blood vomiting, and a hollow appears on the fractured bone, which is not concealed to the sense; the restoration is that the weak one lies down with his back upon it, and place between the splints a pillow.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press his humeri (shoulders), and bring the ribs from two sides or flanks with the hands; and chisel on its equal side, in any way possible that can be attained, until the figure of the bone returns, according to what is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place upon it an ointment and wool, and place above it a star from a thin board of elm or yew, or similar ones in lightness, after you fold it in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then chisel on the binding (the splint) over the fractured bone to prevent it from being dislodged; and go with the binding according to its roundness to the back several times, and tighten it with a fitting ligature.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the binding at every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it; and if its necessity provokes its solution due to itching or corrosion that happens in the place, or pain, or abscess; then hurry, and dissolve it, remove the ointment, and correct whatever happened with the method of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then bring back the ointment if you see it facing it (the fracture); and connect a ligature to it until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 Chapter on the restoration of ribs when they break.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 You should know that the fracture of a costal bone does not happen except in thick places following the back, and from their extremities from the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And it does not happen to them by rubbing, unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of this does not escape the sense during examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And its restoration is done in such a way that it is leveled with the fingers according to the possible manner, until it becomes equal in form, as necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then apply ointments, and bind the broken bone with a splint, if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 And if the fracture of a costal bone is sloping towards the inside: then there occurs intense pain in the weak, and puncture, like the puncture that happens to one who has pleurisy; because the bone pierces the membrane, and also there occurs difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood much; and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And the ancients were skilled in this with many devices; and among them are those who say that you should put food for the weak that generates inflammation and wind, so that the stomach is inflamed and extended, and pushed the fracture towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 We, however, reject that a cause for making a warm abscess should be made if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If, however, it has already occurred, then add this to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them said: Place a bladder on the spot, then squeeze it with force, and it will be more similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 However, it is feared that the bladder attracts excess to the spot, due to its weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them said: The place should be covered with wool that has been soaked in hot oil; and fleas should be placed between the ribs until it is filled; so that the binding will be equal when you roll it according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the sick person is treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If the patient is severely constricted and cannot bear it, and we pierce the skin with puncture causing pain, and we are afraid for the patient, then it is necessary that we cut over the area and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then place on it the instrument that conserves the sifac, whose memory has been mentioned earlier; and cut the bone easily, and cut the same (bone).
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we will bring together two lips of the wound if it is large with stitching; and treat the same (wound) with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If, meanwhile, there occurs a hot abscess, then hurry and pour pulverized charcoal into rose oil, and place it on the site; and the sick person is treated with what suits an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 Furthermore, a poultice should be applied to the side on which he lies until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 Chapter on the restoration of fracture of the spine and neck.
Caput X.	 Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 Fractures of the neck bones sometimes occur, and rarely is there attrition for them; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 When such a case happens to someone, and you want to know if it will heal or not, then investigate.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 For if you see that the person's hands are already softened, stunned and dead; and he cannot move them or extend them or contract them; and when you press them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, it feels nothing nor pain in them, then you know that it will not heal, and in many cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If he moves them and feels the pressure with his fingers and pricking, then you know that the neck bone is healthy, and that the sick person will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If it should happen with the spondylus (vertebra) of the back similar to that one, and you wish to know whether it can be healed or not: then consider his feet; then if you see that they are softened, and the same thing happens in them as happens in hands: next, when it lies on its back, it expels wind and vomiting involuntarily: and when it lies on its belly, it expels vomiting involuntarily: and when it lies on its back and wishes to have intercourse but cannot: then you will know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Do not exert efforts in treating it (the vertebra or spondylus).
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 If nothing of that happens to him, the case is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for that which happens to him (the vertebra or spondylus) is as follows: you should seek a hot lancing (or cauterization): thus, you place on the Spondylus (vertebra) a rubbed oil of roses only; or with saturated eggs of a sheep.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place it (the hot lancing or cauterization) several times a day until the warm abscess subsides: then place on one location of a strengthening and drying plaster and bind it tightly over it with a bandage; and instruct the patient to rest quietly and calmly.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 He should not sleep on the part where he found pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it happens during the rubbing of the satheus bone or if something separated from it occurs: then you must remove it and let it heal over the skin.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Next, apply two lips of the wound (if it is large), with stitching.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with some ointment until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If the last bone of the alhausos (spine or vertebra) breaks and it is the end of the tail: then you must insert your left thumb into the anus, and with the other hand, you should align the broken bone according to what is possible, and secondly in accordance with the alignment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place it upon him, and remove it; and care for the wound with the treatment that preceded, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 On the Restoration of Anus.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Rarely do the bones of the anus break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they break, then the fracture of these bones is not complete, but rather a comminution at their extremities; and they are split lengthwise and turned towards the interior; and there occurs pain and swelling in the place, and puncturing; and the limb that breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And its restoration is to extend your hand over it until you feel the exact shape of the fracture.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the fracture is only at its extremities, then align that fracture according to your preparation, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If the fracture is along its length or has already turned towards the inside; then make the weak person lie on his belly until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you have aligned it (the fracture), place an ointment on it; then place a splint made of wood or hide over it, and tie a binding around it that will not cause the fracture to shift or the splint to be removed.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And align the concavity of these (the fractured bones) with the one that fills it, until the binding takes hold of it according to its alignment; and tell the weak person to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If a hot abscess occurs (on the anus); then cease extending it (the fracture) and its restoration until the hot abscess subsides; and place whatever it lies on, according to what preceded, and then return to its restoration; and bind it as needed.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If it happens to a bone that it becomes fractured, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Thighbone.
Caput XII.	 Title XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The aid is that which is between the elbow and the head of the Spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One of them is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, in this shape which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And bind on both ends two thongs.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is suspended from a raised place, and the sick one sits upon a chair.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then cast his broken arm upon a stick, until it reaches the joint of that stick, where its splinter is attached to the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then place something heavy above it, so that the staff will extend towards lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the physician shall press the fracture with both hands until it returns to its proper place.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 And another method is that the weak one should lie on his neck, and hang his hand from his neck with a strap.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then order two attendants to hold the part above the fracture with their hands: and let one of them hold the lower part, and each shall stretch his own in that direction.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if you wish for a stronger extension, then tie a bandage below the fracture and above it with another: and let each of the two attendants stretch their respective parts in opposite directions.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If the fracture is near to the end of the shoulder, then it is necessary to place one bandage below the joint, and another one towards the elbow under the fracture.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly if the fracture is near to the elbow: then it is necessary to place a bandage on that place and another one above the elbow.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then equal the fracture easily without effort, until it aligns as necessary, and is applied properly: then bind it if no hot abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 But if a hot abscess occurs, then release the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 Place linen cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil on it until the abscess settles down: then bind it; and the method of binding is to apply a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then place a new cloth layer over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then bring the arm and place his hand on the support, and put his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 Place a cloth and bind it over the assisting arm, so that the arm remains in place like a star; if it does not prevent anything from being removed, nor be altered by something broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If you fear that something may be altered by the broken bone, then use a larger and stronger star (astellus). It is so that you place a larger and stronger star over the fracture itself.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 Place between every star the width of a finger; and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture, with an addition of three fingers from all sides.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then bind over the stars as I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 It is so that your bandage be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And as the fracture extends more, the binding should be less tight.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If you see the position of the stars and the bandage, as we said, at the hour when you restore the member, then do so; and if you fear a hot abscess, then release the binding and the stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the bandage for three days, so that itchiness, swelling or food does not reach the member due to the tightness of the binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Correct this entire thing as I said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 But if you are confident that nothing will happen from it; then do not loosen the bandage, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 Let the sick person lie on his back and place his hand on his stomach; and put a full wool blanket under the assisting arm equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 Consider at every hour of the night or day that the shape of the broken member is not loosened nor is the binding made softer.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Correct this entire thing with your own strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 Place the food of the sick according to the order we have prescribed, so that it be a subtle food initially, until the bone begins to bind; then it is necessary to increase his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For the custom of helping and healing wounds is to be bound for forty days; therefore, when it has become bound, it is necessary to loosen it and administer a bath, and treat it with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the fracture is foul, scrape it; then do not loosen the bandage and nails from it for fifty days, nor until two months have passed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Chapter on the restoration of a broken arm.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is made up of two bones, which are called the two forearm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One of them is small; and that one follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other is large, and that one is positioned below the small one from its lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore, perhaps only the larger forearm bone is broken, or perhaps both are broken.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 When the smaller forearm bone is broken at the top, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the larger forearm bone is broken from below, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And it becomes worse if both bones are broken at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm bone at the top, then it is appropriate for the doctor to be present during its restoration, so that he may apply a small extension easily until it equalizes itself.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 If however the larger forearm bone is the one that is broken: then a strong traction must be applied.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it is necessary to arrange the hand during its restoration and extend its extension over the pulley.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 The thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers; and the inferior joint should be higher than all the fingers, or the remaining ones. A weak person sitting should have a square shape on himself, and the pulley should be before him, or directly in front of him, at a height, so that the weak man does not exert himself too much.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then let the attendant extend the arm from its lower part, either with his hand or with a rope.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another assistant should extend it likewise from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the physician aligns the bone until he brings it back to its best possible shape.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are fragments of a broken bone, then try to put all the pieces back into their place by your own effort.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 If it appears that a fragment of bone is separated and pierces the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration: then fill in the hole over it, and remove it as we have said in what has been mentioned before.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 If there is a fracture with a wound, I have already written a special chapter about it, so take care of that from here onward.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If a hot abscess should happen at the beginning of your treatment, then fold a cloth with wax made from rose oil, and white beeswax, and let it be neither too thick nor too thin. Tie the cloth over it with a fine ligature until the abscess subsides. Then remove the wax, and place prepared plaster made from flour mill dust and egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place a splint (or wooden support), and the splint that is placed on the fracture should be slightly wider and stronger than the fracture itself.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of splints for an arm is six in most arrangements; whether it is a fracture in one splint or in two splints at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place your ligature at the stronger and more intense part of the fracture and somewhat further towards the upper or lower parts of it; or place a softer ligature, according to what was previously remembered about it at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And let the bandages surrounding the fracture be made of soft, moist cloth; and they should not be hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 And let the thread used for binding be medium-thickness linen as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 Examine the limb and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something occurs which requires correction, such as itching of the limb: then it is necessary to wash the affected limb with warm water until the itching subsides and let the limb rest without constriction until it has settled; then tie again.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 If the ligature has already been softened and the bone removed, and similar things: then correct it all with your skill and examine again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 For if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive constriction of the ligature, then it is necessary to soften it somewhat and let it rest for some days until it reaches the nourishment again; then tie it up again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 But if nothing from those mentioned above occurs to the sick man, then it is not necessary to untie it unless after twenty days or about that.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then the hand of the sick man is suspended at his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And let his neck be kept equal and protected from excessive movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 Make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 And know that this fracture is healed within thirty or forty days; it may be healed within twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 Everything depends on the dispositions of the temperaments and the dispositions of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 On the restoration of hand fractures.
Caput XIIII.	 Title (Chapter XIV).
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that the scissors-hand and finger joints rarely break.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 It does not happen to him except from repeated friction.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When the foot fracture or joint occurs from friction: then it is necessary that the weak quadrate sits: and before him there should be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 The assistant shall spread out the broken bones, and the physician shall equalize them until they are joined together by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary to place plaster and wool, unless there occurs a hot abscess.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place the splint on top according to the size of the place; and you shall now roll it up in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If the fracture is around the toes approximately the navel of the foot, then make something similar to a ball from cloth; and command the patient to bend over it with his injured foot; then it shall be bound with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the splint be made of leather, in which there is softness, so that the skin of the sole may be applied to it; and bind it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary to place one splint on top and another below on the foot; and keep the hand open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then place a bandage, as the hand is rolled up; and extend it between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If there occurs a fracture in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it shall be equalized as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then bind it with the foot; and if there are more than one, place a straight splint under it, smaller; so that the fracture may be raised and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If the fracture is in the remaining fingers such as the middle finger, the index finger, the little finger or the ring finger, then equalize it and bind it with a healthy finger that follows it; or bind all of them according to continuity; and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Or place a smaller splint over it, as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And be careful in your restoration, and after this position of hot abscesses; and apply to it as necessary, whenever something occurs from it, according to its description.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 Restoration of a Hip Fracture.
Caput XV.	 Chapter Fifteen.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The thighbone (OS Coxae) is often broken and palpable to the touch because it turns towards the inner and posterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its restoration is done by tightening a ligament above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 The patient is laid supine on his back.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then, each ligament used for the treatment should be extended to its respective side equally: and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 If the fracture is close to the root of the thighbone (Coxae), then let a ligament fall on one side, so that the extension goes upwards; and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And similarly if the fracture is close to the knee, then let a ligament be near the knee, so that the extension goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 The doctor then sets the bone with both his hands until he brings it back to its original shape; and joins the bone by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then, one must apply an ointment and a bandage if no abscess occurs in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If an abscess occurs in this, then let it be for several days until the abscess subsides and becomes warm; then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 The bandage should be like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is necessary to wrap a hard cloth around the fracture, that is, binding; and double it twice or three times; and there should be an excess left over from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wrap the leg until it reaches the heel at the root of the toes.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And insert a long thread between the thighbone and the leg near the knee towards the lower part; and the ends of the thread should come from the upper part of both sides.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then wrap again over the leg and the thighbone where there is an excess of cloth from elsewhere.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place stars (or pins) on the thigh at the location of the fracture and place one star over the limb's bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill the voids between the thigh and the hip with soft cloth to make it equal (in length).
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then begin the strong incision from the middle above the location of the fracture with three or four revolutions.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you extend the ligament from the location of the fracture, let your incision be shorter and softer, and more gentle.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then aim for the two ends of the cord that you inserted between the thigh and the hip.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Tie three stars (or pins) to each end.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go with the two ends of the cord to the lower parts until you reach the ankle bone of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And bind the other ends of the stars as well to prevent the cord from moving away from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then release (the pressure) on the incision as long as it remains, so that it does not cause rot to the limb, or abscess, or swelling, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If anything happens from this.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Approach then with the solution of it and correct everything that happened there, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 But if the broken bone splinter pierces the other bone: then it is necessary to equalize (the fracture) if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, fill it up and remove it; take care of the one whose memory preceded until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 Sometimes this thigh fracture is bound (immobilized) beyond what the pins added for it, as we said in aid and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, in repairing this kind of fracture, there is no limp in the lame person.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 But if it is repaired alone, without applying the other leg to it, then it is necessary that the lame person always limps.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 And know that the hip (coxa) is bound for fifty days, or it may be slightly increased or slightly decreased: all of this depends on the diversity of temperaments and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 On the restoration of a fracture of the knee joint (Rotulae).
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that a fracture of the knee joint (Rotulae) rarely occurs, but it often happens that it is rubbed.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 But if a fracture occurs, then it will only be either a crack or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 And this is with an injury and without an injury.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 It stands on it (the fractured bone) entirely with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 And the restoration of this is such that it is made equal to what was broken from its parts with fingers, until it is joined, and united according to what is possible by equality and ease, and construction (reconstruction).
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then apply a plaster made from wheat flour or milled flour with egg white: and place on top of it a round stopper (if necessary): and bind above it with a band suitable for that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the dispositions that we have mentioned in other fractures: such as a warm abscess and similar to it: so that you counteract every occurrence with what is suitable for it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 On the restoration of a fracture of the leg (Cruris).
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that the leg (Cruris) consists of two bones, one of which is large and called by the name Cruris; and the other is small and called Focile.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And it happens that there are also fractures of both the leg bones, as with the two bones of the arm; and because of this, the restoration of these is equal to the restoration of the arm, and the procedure is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If both bones break at once, the leg (Crus) becomes deformed in all its parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 If a bone is fractured more finely, it turns to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 If a bone is fractured coarsely, you will find it below; it belongs to those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then administer extension, equalization, and ligature of stars equally according to it.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 However, if the fracture of the leg is a dirty fracture with many set-backs, it should have a smaller extension and softer alluvial treatment by you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 Moreover, in the leg there is something from the operation that is similar to the arm; and it is that when you equalize stars, and complete your entire operation, then take two bands made of pine wood, which are used in the making of roof tiles placed under tables; they are made from wooden spatulas; choose those with small thickness, and neither too small nor too large; and their length should be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then fold over each cloth with two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 And place one part of the leg on one side and the other part on the opposite side; they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then bind two bands at three places from both ends and in the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 For when ligature is forbidden, the leg inclines to the right and left, and it stands steadily on a good stance.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And now, a splint made of wood according to the length of the leg should be administered, and the leg should be placed in it to keep it still.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 It is especially important that you do this when there is a wound properly with the fracture.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then consider the leg every day and study it diligently from swelling, edema, or other problems.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If something happens among those, then oppose it with what is necessary until it heals, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the Fracture of Bones in the Foot, and Fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 On Amputations.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 Calcaneum certainly does not undergo a complete fracture.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 The bones of the foot sometimes undergo a fracture, and it happens seldom to the fingers; but they do not break except from repeated rubbing in various positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs, and you see those bones rise up against each other, then place the sick person's foot on the ground prepared as when walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand you there, and place your foot on what is raised by those bones; afterwards press or tread it down: and hold it even, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then place an ointment and a plaster on it; and place under the heel of the foot a small board with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then tie it with a suitable bandage when you have rolled it up with cloths and the other things that are needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 When three or four days have passed, then unbind the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find the bones aligned if they are fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 Therefore, the operation is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If some fingers are broken, then restore them, and align them as I told you in the treatment of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place a peg under the finger according to its length and let it be slightly wider; then place the board that I told you about under the foot and bind it with a suitable bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If what is broken consists of two or more bones, then place a peg of the appropriate size under each finger, rolled up in linen cloth; and bind the board at the bottom of the foot; let the board stand on one head of the board outside the heel to hold it firmly.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 It is fitting for you to remember not to forget all that I have said to you regarding other fractures, concerning the accidents which were mentioned; and apply this to every accident as needed.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 On the fracture of a woman's jaw, and the clavicle, and the man's penis.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's jaw is fractured, then make her sit square-like (in a reclined position).
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then incline her towards the back of the same (head) somewhat, and hold her backwards.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then fill the woman's jaw with a linen wrap until it is full; and let it be shaped on the jaw like a sphere (rounded).
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then strike the woman gently, and lift her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For this linen wrap will come out before the opening of the jaw becomes like a sphere, and the broken bone returns to its place.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a feather upon her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 When he (the physician) wants to insert his hand, let him remove the linen wrap easily, then insert; and return it in the same manner as when he first inserted it; then return to the feather first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 He should do this for seven days or about, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you wish, take the bladder of an ox and fill it with a reed tube, and insert the entire bladder into her jaw.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow through the reed tube forcefully until the bladder inflates inside the jaw, for the fracture returns to its place.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then it is filled with linen wrap and remains for some days as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 When the clavicle of a man or woman is fractured, then administer its restoration and use what we have said regarding the equalization for the bone of Ancha.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And the rectum is not hidden in those fractures which are close, which rarely happen, especially in one who has some inclination or practice.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 And understand my book very much, for the fracture itself signifies to you in many dispositions a straight path for its restoration and for its constriction; therefore understand it.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 When the penis of a man is broken, take the neck of a goose and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place upon him a cover made of cloth, wrap it up, and let it be for three days or around those days, and it will heal if God wishes.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 On the restoration of a broken bone, when it is with a wound.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is fitting for the one who has a broken bone with a wound, especially if it is large like the hip or scapula or something similar, that you hurry and apply the phlebotomist; if they inform you of the conditions of phlebotomy as we have mentioned before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound flows blood, then it is necessary that you hurry to the excision of it, so that you sprinkle on top of it a powder made from crushed chalk; if there is no other present to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin the restoration of the fracture on that same day and do not delay it unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If however a hot abscess occurs, then delay the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess settles down.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach him on the third and fourth day at all, for you would make bad things happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 If the broken bone is projecting above the skin and detected: then it is necessary to compress it, and bring it back with your hands with ease and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 If however the extension is not prepared, and its equal with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And is the instrument which is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven or eight fingers, and its width according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And for this reason it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four according to the size which he needs for the cure of any kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And let it be round: and let there be a small thickness within it so that it is not doubled during the compression upon it during the hour of the operation; and let it have sharp edges, with a border at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And let the thickness of it be from the middle of it to the lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 In this operation it is necessary to place the sharp edge of it concave against the end of the projecting bone; and push it with one blow until the bone returns and becomes equal in some way.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Therefore try to make the ends of the fracture opposite each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the end of the fracture is fine and does not accept the instrument well, then it is necessary to cut the edge of that bone until the instrument has control over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 But if you cannot reduce them with what I have mentioned, then cut it with the saws which I have said; or cut it with one of the saws in any way that is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then plane off what remains in the bone due to roughness and small layers.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 When the bone is reduced and finds that there is a weak spot after its reduction causing a violent pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	 Make it so.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 Thou conferrest a great remedy upon the sick one, when thou complete the restoration which thou dost make of the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then immerse the cloth in wine of stibium, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And place not thereon greenish substances, nor anything containing oil; so that putrefaction and corruption may not occur in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer astelas at the hour of completion of thy restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And leave the wound exposed; thus, cut with forceps the hole in the fracture according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 And take care not to suture the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For this have many foolish physicians often done it; and they have caused death upon their sick ones, or corruption, or gangrene, that is, pus.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And let thy suture be soft, gentle, and diverse from the sutures of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad, or if it is a large wound, and thou fearest some evil incidents which we have mentioned, and thou findest pain in a suspended place; then it is not necessary that thou place astelas upon it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make for them immobilizations with hard cloths in the place of astelas, and suture it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 And when it is a day or two after, and thou seest that the wound already begins to produce pus; then take away the cloth which thou hast placed upon it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then administer linen and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds; such as ointment of four ingredients (tetrapharmacon), and similar things.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it suits thee, that thou loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 Consider the wound every day, both morning and evening, until it consolidates, and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 It is necessary that the limb should be prepared so that the pus runs out from it easily towards the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If many days pass without the wound healing and the pus is not discharged from it: then you know that there are small splinters of bone there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, one must examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 How many of those splinters are separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those which are not separated and pierce the limb, causing pain, try to cut them and remove them in any way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If a blister or boil should happen on the wound, that is to say if there are symptoms of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary that you apply to each one of them what is suitable for it from the remedies mentioned in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And in that which my speech should remain, and for whom you make your mind present when a bone is broken and protrudes on the limb, such as the hip bone or shoulder bones and similar large bones, it is not to presume the attraction of it, for often death occurs from this, indeed, leave it alone until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps it will fall off by itself within twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Therefore, treat the wound if you see fit to do so; and if not, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a nodule at the site of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 This nodule often happens in the site of healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 It is particularly those near the joints that are corrupted and form an abscess on the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it prevents the limb from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Consider then, if the bandage is recent: administer medications that have astringent properties, such as aloe, olibanum, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Take some or all of these [medicines]: mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or vinegar; and place them on the bandage on top of a wad, and tightly bind it over the affected area.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And release the binding, do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then loosen it, and repeat the process until the bandage is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or tighten it well over the lead plate.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead has the property of removing anything that is feared from the body.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the bandage has already turned into a stone and is tightened and urgently requires removal: then bind over it from the upper part of it, and cut off any excessive growth; or grind it with certain scrapers until it is removed; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 Section on treatment when the limb restores itself, but remains weak after the injury, not according to its natural state.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When a bone fracture heals and the limb remains weak afterwards, this is not done unless for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 Among them is an excess of loosening and binding of the ligament not as required: either due to redundancy of tightening of the ligaments until nutriment is forbidden to flow to the member: or due to excessive embrocation in a non-appropriate time: or due to scarcity of blood in the body of the sick and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 And the treatment for this is, to feed the sick, and make his body tender until blood multiplies within him.
Et administra balneum.	 And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 And pour joy and happiness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place pitch on the member, so that the pitch attracts much nourishment towards it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 And constantly embrocate his member with warm water until the nourishment runs, and returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 Chapter on the treatment of broken bones when they are restored twisted.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 When the member which has already been restored after healing is found twisted or protruding of the broken bone, or swollen: and it defaces the form of the limb, but the limb is not prohibited from its natural operation: then one should not receive the opinion of him who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who did this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 This operation is indeed very condemnable, leading to death or great fear that it may be fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 But if the limping and swelling are recent: then it is necessary to embrocate with warm water in which have been boiled softening herbs such as althea leaves and its root, melilotus, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And make for him a plaster with a softening plaster like well-prepared dyachilon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Take a mucilage from the root of the althea, grind it with chicken fat or sesame oil; and apply it with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Take figs (that are) fat, grind them with pigeon dung and similar substances that are named for reducing consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes a knot is loosened with persistent friction, an old and gentle method which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 Let movement be administered to the limb for every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If however the crookedness has already occurred and it is strong and it has been turned into a stone, and its necessity for treatment with iron has arisen: then it is necessary that it be cut above it, and the continuation of the bone be loosened, and what is superfluous from the knot or the bone with finer chisels be cut away; and let ease be administered to it with diligence and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 Chapter on Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the coming out of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Why it should be prohibited from movement, and become deformed in the form of the limb.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And this causes pain to occur on the weak side, and very severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 When therefore a dislocation occurs, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration; nor should one delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if it is delayed, the place will relax, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore it should not be moved nor extended during the hour of relaxation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Because many times it causes a spasm, and painful injuries to occur.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 But when this happens, then it is necessary that you hurry to the bloodletting of the weak person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then it should be left until the relaxation relaxes.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then anoint the limb with hot water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then bring back easily (or gently).
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And rub all the limbs with it, when memory comes to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I myself have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, even according to what came before in fracture, from the upper part of the body downwards to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 Chapter on the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 The two Jaws scarcely dislocate except rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 And dislocation occurs according to two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 For it is either moved away from its place by slight movement and becomes slightly softened.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 The dislocation should be reduced by complete reduction, until it becomes soft to the chest part, until the saliva of the weak runs and it cannot hold it, nor can it close its mouth, and its tongue is rolled up with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 When the dislocation is small, then by itself it returns through various dispositions with a few.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 If the dislocation is complete and whole: then it must be administered a quick reduction, and it should not be delayed much; and it is necessary that the assistant holds the head of the weak; and the doctor inserts one finger of his hand into the root of the Mandible dislocation, if the dislocation is from one part.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or he inserts two fingers at the same time, if the dislocation is from two parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the remaining fingers of his hand should be outside, which are equal.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And command the weak, that he cleans the Mandibles of himself, and purifies them for eating to every part.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the doctor presses the Mandible, and pushes it until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the reduction is difficult, especially if both Mandibles are at the same time: then administer steam with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy; nor delay the reduction of both entirely, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When they return and meet, and the mouth of the weak is closed, and they are not softened: then place poultices on them made of pieces of cloth with wax, and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it is tied with soft bands.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And let the sleep of the weak be on his back; and let his head be standing between two poultices, so that it does not move to the right and left; nor let him try or be forced to chew something; instead let food be placed before him gently softened, until when the pains are removed, and the Mandible is loosened: then he eats what he wants, and that is given with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 Do not work on his mouth's operation for eating and drinking, and for talking, until the mandible has healed and is well.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the reduction of the two mandibles becomes difficult when they are dislocated at any time and do not return to their places: then often fevers occur, and continuous diarrhea; and perhaps the weak person's abdomen ruptures, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 Therefore, when you see that: then you will know, it is a loss, and often he who experiences this dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Chapter on the reduction of dislocations in the neck (collarbone) and the end of the upper arm.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The collarbone is not dislocated from the inside on the side due to its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 It becomes dislocated occasionally towards the outside, and that is noticeable to sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 The restoration of it is that the sick one lies down on his back, and spreads out his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then bring your hand close to the place with strong compaction, because it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then put on top of it an ointment and a linen cloth, and tie it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 However, the ends that follow the elbow should not be dislocated unless rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is dislocated on some day: then it must be returned and equalized according to what we have said, and that which is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then put on top of it an ointment and a linen cloth, and tie it with a bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And command the sick man to remain in calmness and stillness until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And when this same treatment returns the arm's end, even if it has separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 Chapter on the Reduction of Dislocation of the Arm.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the shoulder does not dislocate except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One is when it dislocates towards the lower part, towards the armpit.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second is when it dislocates towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it dislocates towards the upper part of the shoulder, and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 Nor is it dislocated to the backside, because of the shoulder blade.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 Nor is it dislocated to the front side, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 And indeed it is most often dislocated and exits towards the lower part turned towards the armpit; especially in those whose flesh is less.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Because it quickly comes out of them and quickly goes back in.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 In those whose flesh is numerous, it is contrary to that one, namely because it exits with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps it happens to some men with a blow or a fall and the humerus is dislocated and hotly cauterized, and it is believed because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you try that, until you are certain of its nature, and then proceed with its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 A dislocation is known when it is turned towards the little finger: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus, and a healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you will find among them a manifest difference, and in the head of the Humerus you will find a concavity, and under the little finger by touch the head of the humerus seems like an egg: and the weak cannot bring the hand to the ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if dislocated towards the chest or upwards: then you will find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 The reduction of this kind of dislocation is easy when it is recent, or if the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 And its reduction is that the assistant raises his hand towards the upper part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs under the little finger of it, and lift the joint with force towards its place; and the assistant raises his hand, and extends it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then he puts it back down, for it quickly returns to its place.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 If it does not return through what I have said, and from the beginning when the dislocation occurred many days have passed: then it is necessary that the weak person be bathed in warm water, and ointment administered which softens and soothes, such as if they boil the roots of althea, fenugreek, and melilotus in water, and apply it.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then the sick person lies down on his back: and a sphere and wool should be placed under his navel, which is equal in size between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor places his heel on the sphere, and he lifts up the head of the arm with force, and pulls the hand of the sick person downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another servant holds the head of the sick person, so that he does not move downwards; for he will return immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish, bring him back in this manner: and it is, so that you make the present man who is taller than the sick person stand on his side, and he will insert his arm under the navel of the sick person: and lift up the navel of his upwards, until the sick person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another servant pulls the hand of the sick person downwards to his stomach.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the sick person is lightweight: then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, so as to weigh him down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And it is also brought back in another manner: and it is, so that a long piece of wood is formed on the ground, whose head is rounded like a cuff; as a mace handle; which should not be too heavy, nor too delicate.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then place something soft under the sick person when they are placed on the log; and the sick person should stand along the length of the log.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then his hand is stretched downwards on one side, and his body on the other side with force; for the dislocation returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If the reduction is difficult by all that has been said, then use this method: and it is, so that you take a piece of wood whose length is the measurement of two forearms, and its width four fingers, and its thickness two fingers; and its head should be rounded, to alleviate the entrance into the deep navel, in accordance with this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then, soft cloths are to be tied over the round head, so as not to injure the weak wood [referring to a part of a surgical instrument].
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then, place it under the weak spot of the patient, so that the hand or arm can be extended over the wood until below: and tie the wooden support to the arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then, place the arm on the step of the ladder at its width, and extend the hand below, and let the rest of the body hang suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 The joint is to enter immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 Once the entrance is completed in whatever way possible: then it is necessary to place beneath the weak spot a sphere of equal size made from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place the prepared plaster made of milled powder with oil of myrrh and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it is turned [over].
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then bind under the weak spot a suitable stitch: and turn the bandage over the plaster above: and connect the hand to its own neck, and let it not be moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 And it is necessary to place a sparse food until the member recovers strength, because it is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then, after seven or five days, let it be removed with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If it hardens and does not soften, then it is healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If the joint is dislocated many times due to moisture that happens to it or due to another cause: then it is necessary to administer cautery with three holes, according to what was stated in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If all of this is done, and the bandage is loosened after seven days, and the joint does not harden, and the plaster and stitch are repeatedly placed on it but do not firm up, and it falls, and cannot be raised to higher places: then you will know that the nerves that are toward the head of the shoulder have been cut or stretched or softened: and you will know that the joint will never be able to heal in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 Dislocations that occur towards the chest and breast, or are reduced to the rear, are done with pressure and extension using hands: until it returns, and further compression and care are administered in it, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If there is heaviness in the member after healing and slowness in its movement, then the patient should use baths often, until that heaviness lessens, and it returns to its original state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Chapter on the cure of shoulder dislocations.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 Know that the union of the shoulder dislocates with difficulty, and it returns with difficulty as well; and indeed, it is dislocated in all directions, but particularly towards the front or rear.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And its dislocation will not be hidden from you: because it falls under sight and touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join a dislocated shoulder with a healthy one, the condition will be clearly shown to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 For the joint should be hollowed out, and it cannot bend the arm nor touch its own humerus with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And you must hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if a hot abscess occurs to it, the reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially when it is towards the rear.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 For it is worse than all kinds of dislocations, and of more violent pain; and death often accompanies it many times.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is as follows: extend the hand with both hands; let the arm be extended, and the doctor's hands be above and under the shoulder, and he himself pushes the joint with the tips of his fingers or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 If it is a dislocation to the front: then [the hand] returns so that it doubles with its own hand, until it strikes with the root of its palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation does not obey in reduction, then administer strong and violent extension; it is such that two servants extend the arm; and the same two servants hold it so that it is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then the arm is turned to every part after it has been wrapped over its own hand with a long cloth or a wide bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the doctor touches with his hand the joint, he binds it with oil; so that it is one of those things which help for lubricity of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then he pushes the joint with a strong push until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After its reduction, it is necessary to place over it a plaster containing styptics and extract with egg white; and it is tied with a suitable ligature.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 The arm is suspended from the neck of the sick person, and leave for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then it is loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If the joint hardens in its place, then loose the bandage from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see that the joint is not bound well, then renew the plaster, and the bandage, and leave it for some days until it hardens.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If there is pain after the reduction of the joint and it moves badly: then administer humectation in bathing, and subtle friction, and compression until it settles, or place over the joint of the leg, that is, the woolly fat of a ram.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then bind it and leave it over it for a day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it, and immerse it in the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 When it sweats, then press the joint with moderate rubbing.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then repeat over the same spot three times with a pounce and secondly, with the introduction of bath, until it becomes softened.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you wish, place upon it dung of cow, moistened and heated with butter, and press upon it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Make that [process] several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 It becomes softened, and returns to its own condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 Chapter on the treatment of dislocations by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 Mahasem's hand is frequently dislocated, that is, the joint between arm and hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 The reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 On the contrary, other joints [are more difficult].
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, speed should be present in the reduction of this dislocation within the hour when it is dislocated, before the location is loosened; otherwise a hot abscess may occur there.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 And the reduction of this dislocation is that Mahasem's weak hand should be placed on a table, and the servant should extend it; and the doctor should place his palm over the prominent part of the joint, and press on it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, if the palm has already retreated to the back of the hand, then the weak hand should be placed on a table for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be internally over the table, that is, the inside part of the hand should be over the table so that the doctor's hand falls upon the prominent part of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then press it with a plaster to suppress the abscess; and leave it alone, do not repeat the process.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 For if it does not tolerate the reduction process and more days pass without improvement, yet the joint remains in its twisted state; and nothing harms the weak hand except that it becomes softened, and cannot be pressed; then you will know that the nerves have been severed or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 The skill in that (situation) is not to tie it with a cautery, except for saving its life.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps it contributes nothing.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 Since Almahassem did not return, then place on him the plaster that I mentioned earlier.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then it should be tied and let go for five days; afterwards it should be untied and let go, and the hand should be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If its movement is hindered and something heavy occurs to it: then soften it with warm water and rub it gently several times until it becomes soft.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 Chapter on the cure of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX (30).
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated in any direction, or when the finger is dislocated to the back of the palm, or the palm's ventrum: then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then hold the finger's head and hang it in the direction to which it is dislocated, and let it be for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then hang it and stretch it until it becomes straight on that same day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 And when it is night, tie it as mentioned; do not stop untying it during the day; exercise it with movement and tie it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do this for several days until it becomes tied (or immobilized).
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And likewise do this if it (the finger) is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; tie it to that same part and perform your first treatment on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And likewise do this when it (the finger) is dislocated in other directions.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 Chapter on the cure of spine dislocations (or vertebrae dislocations).
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI (31).
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When someone has a spine (vertebra) dislocation of the back or neck, complete dislocation, or when many vertebrae are displaced from their places: then there is no cure for it, since death approaches the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 The sign of it is that the illness of a person leaves without will, nor can it be held; and many times certain members of his are softened from it, or two legs of his, or two arms of his, or one of them; or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 Sometimes it is removed (of certain members), which often occurs in their removal from four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 Therefore, that which is removed towards the rear, is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 The cure of it is to consider whether Gibbosity occurs from childhood; then there is no cure in it, nor healing at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 But in that which occurs from an accident, or a blow, or similar things, the ancient ways of treatment have been said with a long speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 It rarely returns (when it is removed) with good result.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 I myself have already abridged it from that (treatise), which explains very little of its substance due to my proximity to the intention; and in my explanation, I explained that and shaped its instrument differently from how they showed and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, in Gibbosity which occurs from the front side, there is no skill, nor healing from that.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly in that which happens on both sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not cured from them, except that which occurs on the back itself, as I am going to say; and it is necessary for the sick person to extend himself over his face on a plank equal to nearly a wall; and a damp cloth should be spread under him so as not to injure his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then a straight piece of wood is placed fixed in the mortar on the ground at the end of the plank, about his head; and another piece of wood about his feet at the end of the other plank; and let the assistant hold the wood, and it should not be fastened in the mortar.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 The other servant holds the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then, lean over the head of the sick person, and beneath his chin, tie a cord firmly: and extend the end of the cord to the wooden post that is near his head: and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then, tie another cord above his ankles, and above his knees, and at his fetters.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the cords together, and tie them to another wooden post that is near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then let all the servants stretch out the cord to any part of the wooden post, and neither of the two posts should be moved from their places where they are fixed: but they should not be fastened, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the physician shall place his hands on the patient's shinbone firmly until he comes back; or he can place it on a board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he ties his feet to the board until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If he does not return with this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And hollow out a hole in the wall as we said near the sick person, into which the end of the board enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the middle part of the board on the shinbone.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And let the physician put his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And tie it tightly until the shinbone is bent and he returns to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then, if you wish, work with the lathe that is rotated by hand: and it is so that you carve two wooden posts in the ground near the head of the sick person at the end of both feet, whose length is that of one arm: and near his head at the end of both feet, two wooden posts.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And the length between each post shall be a palm: and now a hole has been made everywhere where the lathe runs: and all the posts are fastened firmly to the ground, so that they do not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 And a round stick is inserted: and it is a purse where the ligament revolves in two openings of two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at its end there is a hole where the stick is secured, whose length is a palm with what revolves: and the same is in two other sticks as well.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then tie the ligaments which you tied in the chest of the sick man to the purse which is at its head: and tie the ligaments which you tied in his legs to the purse which is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then let a servant stand by every purse, who will twist his hand with a linen cloth, with which the purse revolves: and the physician ties Spondilem, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the shape of the purse, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then when Spondile returns and the place is tied, then it is necessary to place an adhesive plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then wax.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Then place a star-shaped piece of wood on the adhesive plaster, whose width is three fingers, or approximately so.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length should be sufficient to cover the hollow of the hernia and the healthy portion of the testicle.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then it is tied with the ligament that we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And the sick man should be given a subtle diet until he recovers.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If something remains as a protrusion in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe, with the use of the tablets which I have mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now a sheet of lead is given there.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 Sometimes a protrusion occurs at the end of the hernia sac on the back: and it is thought to be a displacement, and that bone now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 It is not appropriate for this medicine to be presumed, for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 On the Treatment of a Dislocated Ankle.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the joints of the ankle and shoulder do not occur except due to dislocation; neither does it happen to them what happens to the other joints due to slight removal and hollowing out.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 Indeed, the joint of the ankle is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 It means that it is dislocated towards the front and the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 And indeed it is mostly dislocated towards the inside; it is seldom dislocated towards the front or the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 The treatment for dislocation towards the inside is: because when you join a healthy leg with an unhealthy one, it is longer; and the knee of the unhealthy one protrudes more than a healthy one, and the unhealthy one cannot double its foot near the groin; there is a place following the groin that is depressed by a depression tool because the head of the hip has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 The sign for dislocation towards the outside is that its symptoms are opposite to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 The sign for dislocation towards the front is that it extends the healthy leg by a bend; however, it does not double it without pain in the knee; if it tries to walk, it cannot do so over it on the front side; and it retains urine, and the groin is pressed, and while walking it strikes against the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 The sign for dislocation towards the back is that it does not extend the knee nor can it double it before doubling the groin; and the leg is even shorter than the other one; and the groin is softened, and the head of the hip is at its place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction of this dislocation, however, is to consider at that time if the dislocation is old, which has already become chronic with the one having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then if you administer the reduction of it and it remains according to its position; then there is no treatment at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, it should not be a presumption for him completely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In the case where dislocation is recent, and it belongs to one of four types of dislocations: then proceed to this, so that you wish to join [the parts], and stretch it towards the inside and outside, and move it right and left: perhaps it returns, and does not need other care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong helper, and he extends the leg from its lower part: either with his hands, or with a bandage that binds above the leg over the knee: and another helper extends the hand above, so that he introduces his hands under the fingers.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then bind it with a soft bandage on the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And the extension is either from the front part of the groin to the neck part, or from the back to the back part.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And the extension of all [limbs] is one and the same, until the weak one is lifted with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 And this kind of extension is a common type among the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If then the dislocation returns as we said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for all cases what I will say about treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In the reduction of [the limb] itself, when dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary for the weak one to lie on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then place a bandage on the root of the hip, in that which is between the head of the hip and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the neck part.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then another strong helper takes his arms and makes a large place on the weak hip small, and extends it towards the outside with a violent extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now, it returns to its own place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this is an easier species among the remaining species of treatment, by which this member is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If it is excised over you, and does not obey you for entry with this species of treatment completely: then, it is necessary that two weak feet be tied together with a strong ligament, soft, above both heels, and above both knees: and let the length of each one be four digits' width: and let the injured leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two digits.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then, the injured one is hung over the head of a stick, which is in the house: and let its length from the ground be two arms' width.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong youth to brace the head of the hip: and let another hang it with the injured one: and let another youth push, bracing the hip with force, for the joining returns to its own place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In its own return, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the injured one lies on a platform, according to what we said in the one having a humpback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And let a ligament be tied over its leg, the injured one's own, and over its chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two sticks are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then a stick is placed in the middle of the platform, firmly fixed: over which are rolled damp cloths, so as not to harm the injured one: and let the stick be between his hips, so as not to pull him down towards the lower parts due to the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then let every servant go to his place, and the doctor sets the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If it obeys in its reversal, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place it on the same platform and press it equally, as we said in the humpback.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 The sick person should lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 When the dislocation is towards the front, then it should be extended quickly the leg of the sick person; and this is according to the same narrative on a bench; and place the physician's palm of his right hand upon the hip of the sick person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then bend him with one hand, and with that bending place him extended towards the lower part at the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 If the dislocation is towards the back: then it is not necessary to extend the sick person downwards and lift him off the ground; rather, it is necessary to place him on a hard surface, as it is also necessary if the dislocation of his shoulder is towards the outside, according to what we said about placing him on two hard surfaces: one under his face and the ligaments extended: according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 It is necessary that a compression be administered with a board also at the place where the joint goes out, when reduction is completed according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of its reduction will not be hidden from you: and it is as if you extend two legs of the sick person; and when you see them equal, and the sick person contracts his leg, and expands himself without straining: then you know that the limb has returned, according to what is necessary: then join the pelvis, and place an ointment, and bind it with something soft, that is, a bandage: so that the shoulder does not move to any part; and let the sick person remain quiet for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then loosen the ligament and the ointment, and bind the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in their state, then you know that the dislocation is already fixed: so release the sick person for walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see something softening: then return, and apply the ointment, and bind it according to your first binding; and leave it for three days as well.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then dissolve it and make him walk slowly on both sides for some days, until he recovers well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 On Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated to the outer, inner, and lower, that is, the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 And the sign of its dislocation is that you order the weak to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 If it does not stick to the hip: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all the ways of dislocation is that you make the weak sit straight, so that he now extends his leg if he can over it, and his back touches your face, and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then make the knee stick with your palms, and straighten them between the fingers over the knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply with your palm the sides of the knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And another servant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 And the sign of restoration is that the leg sticks with the hip gently, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then plaster it and make the leg stick with the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind it with a bandage for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then dissolve it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And the weak should not walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 If the reduction is refused to you, then administer strong extension with bindings whose precursor was mentioned in the treatment of ankle, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 Chapter on the Treatment of Ankle Dislocation.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The heel sometimes moves out slightly and sometimes it is dislocated completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 Dislocation of it can be either internal or external.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 The sign of a dislocation is that you see the calcaneum swollen and protruding towards the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 The treatment of its removal is easy reduction; and it is that it should be extended easily with hands, and equated until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 In the treatment of it when it is dislocated by a jump, it is necessary that you make the patient sit straight; and let a strong servant hold him from the back of his middle part.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold with your right hand the upper part of his foot and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot near the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 Then, with your left hand, twice.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then stretch it with the left hand, and push the foot's chest with the right hand without strain.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do that twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the foot's chest to the leg in the third instance, and you pull the ankle.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If it returns in one or two instances according to this method, and you see the foot equated, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it; because it itself returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 If the reduction of it is prevented by him when we have said; then let the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a pillow firmly on the ground so that he falls between his hips; and you now roll over him with a cloth, so as not to hurt the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then let a servant take his hip; afterwards, let another servant extend the leg either with hands or with a rope that binds over its neck.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then all the servants should extend against its extension; and the pillow should be standing between the hips of the patient, holding him so that his body is not pulled down towards the lower part during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then the physician reduces dislocation with his hands, and another servant holds the healthy leg downward.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 The dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 Whenever the dislocation returns and it is made clear to you that the reduction is good: then place plaster and wool, and tighten it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And it is necessary that you be careful or fear of the nerves which are above the calcaneum posteriorly, so that the bandage is not too tight and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then release him for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the bandage softens, tighten it; then release him on the third or fourth day; and forbid the weak from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 But if he attempts to walk before that period, there is no safety unless the dislocation is loosened again and damaged, and will not accept treatment afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If a hot abscess happens to him: then it is necessary that you administer to his sedation that which was narrated before in another place about treatment, and an embrocation until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 Chapter on dislocations of the fingers of the foot and treatment.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that it is reduced which is dislocated from them with slight extension without effort; and this certainly is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 But if the dislocation is in some knuckles of the foot: then it is necessary that the weak sits his foot on a level place with the ground or on a table; and he stands like walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand, and put your foot over that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then press it with your foot with force until it returns, and you see it already reduced, and the protrusion does not appear in that place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then place under his abdomen a table that can hold his entire foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then tie it with a fitting stitch for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then loosen it and let him rest from walking for many days until it is tied and secured against reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 Chapter on types of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When something like this occurs, and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often follows many times; and on account of this, one should not presume to undertake such a cure except the one who is wise in the art, compassionate, pious, patient, not hasty, nor presumptuous: and that he uses at the beginning only medicines that soothe abscesses with warm things: and that he leaves the sick to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you see or hope for salvation from danger with mildness of illness, and something appears to be hopeful.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Therefore attempt the reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If therefore the limb returns as we desire, then administer a regimen that soothes abscesses; and care for the wound with what is suitable for it from dry ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If the dislocation is with a fracture and splinters are separated from the bone, then attempt their removal; and do what I said for simple illnesses in those places where they occurred.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And be cautious according to your ability, and keep yourself from entering the path of fear; as my previous advice warned you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For it is better for you before your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more healthy for your body before them at your time.
