Chapter Two.
On cauterizing the head also.
If a chronic pain occurs in the entire head, and the patient has been suffering from it for a long time, and has used clysters, and head medicines, and snuffs, and ointments, and bandages, especially if he has been cauterized with the single cautery that we have described, and none of that has benefited him, then consider the following.
If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, then cauterize him with another cautery a little above that one.
Then cauterize him on each temple of his head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone we described is exposed.
And cauterize him in the back of his head, in the place known as "the axe," and lighten your hand in this one, and do not expose the bone, as the patient will experience severe pain from it, unlike the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head, and I will mention this cautery in its place.
The cautery used to cauterize the temples and the back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used to cauterize the middle of the head, and this is its picture.
