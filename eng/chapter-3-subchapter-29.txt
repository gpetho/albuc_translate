 CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE.
On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
 The fingers may be dislocated in any direction.
When one of the fingers is dislocated dorsally or ventrally, then extend the finger and thrust the dislocation with your thumb until it goes back.
Then bind the head of the phalanx, suspending it in the direction in which it was dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then unbind it and extend it so that it may straighten out all that day.
Then at nightfall bind it in just the same way.
Continue to loosen it by day and to exercise it with movement, bandaging it by night.
Do this for some days until it is knit.
Do the same with it if it is a ventral dislocation, binding it in that direction, and treat it as explained above until it is healed.
Do likewise with dislocations in other directions.
