On the restoration of a fracture when it is healed and the limb remains thin and fragile, not in its natural state.	On the treatment of a fracture when, after repair, the limb remains unnaturally thin.	0.75600266
When a bone fracture is restored, and afterwards the limb remains thin and fragile, this is due to several causes: one of which is the large number of bandages and their incorrect application; or excessive tightness of the bandages preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or excessive embrocation; or excessive movement not at the right time; or lack of blood in the patientâ€™s body and their weakness.	When a fractured bone has been repaired but the limb remains thin and weak, this may be due to many causes: the bandaging being too often loosened and not properly tightened; or excessive binding-up so that nourishment cannot flow to the limb; or excessive fomenting; or excessive and premature movement; or the thinness and weakness of the patient's blood.	0.88635874
The cure for this is to feed the patient and make their heart tender until their blood increases; and administer baths; and bring joy and happiness to them.	The treatment of this consists in the nourishing and restoring of his body so there be plenty of blood; and the use of the bath; and cheering the patient and making him happy, and so on.	0.8066826
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws much nourishment to it, or continue embrocation with warm water, until the nourishment flows and the limb returns to its natural state.	Then apply pitch to the limb so that it may draw much nourishment to itself, or continue the massage to the limb with tepid water, so that nourishment flows in the limb and it returns to its normal shape.	0.8730686
