Many times a bone or fishbone, or some other thing, gets stuck in the throat;
therefore you must pull out what you can see, and depress the tongue with the instrument towards the light, so that you can see the thing move; 
and what you cannot see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach;
perhaps the stuck object will come out through vomiting;
or have the patient swallow a piece of sponge, or a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or a morsel of dry bread;
and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it;
and when it reaches the spot, it will swell, and then you will pull it out;
and if it doesn't come out with what we've said, then take a lead instrument of this shape:
And let the instrument be curved at the end so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the tip raised upwards;
and be careful not to touch the epiglottis, so that coughing does not occur, nor push the bone inwards;
and it's better that the patient inserts the instrument, because he knows better where the thing is lodged;
then he pushes it down, or pulls it out with the instrument evenly, until it is out.
