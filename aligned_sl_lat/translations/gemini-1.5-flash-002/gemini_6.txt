After I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its completion, and I have reached the end of it, from its expositions and its explanations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Because manual operation has been neglected in our region and in our time, completely deprived: until perhaps its science perished, and its trace was cut off: and there remained of it only small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have changed: and error and hesitation happened to them, until its intentions were closed, and its force was distanced: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise in it according to the way of position, and explanation, and abbreviation: and that I should come with the forms of the instruments of the Cautery, and the other instruments of the work: as it is done from the addition of explanation, and from the speeding up of what is necessary.
The reason why a good craftsman of it with his hand is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author must be exercised in it before that in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the aids of the members, and their forms, and their conjunction, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their egress, and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their exit.
And because of that Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We indeed already said about that in the introduction of this book.
Because he who is not knowing what we said about anatomy, is not emptied, but indeed falls into error, by which men are killed: just as I saw many of those who are formed in this science, and boast about it without knowledge, and without experience.
That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he cut certain arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from a man, who had advanced in age, and the stone was large. Therefore he arrived at it, and extracted it with a piece of the bladder. Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And I indeed had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the disposition of the sick man, that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a certain Duke of our land on account of medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch, who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hastened with his ignorance, and bound the fracture above the wound with cushions and splints with a strong binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he completed him according to his desires. Afterwards he dismissed him for several days, and ordered him not to loosen the ligature: and it remained thus until his leg and his foot became suppurated, and it came to destruction.
Therefore I was called to him: and I hastened to loosen the ligature: and calm followed, and he escaped from his pains.
Nevertheless, the corruption was already confirmed in the limb: and I could not restrain it.
Therefore the corruption ceased to spread in the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who perforated a cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated afterwards, until its malignancy was magnified with its master.
That is, because when a cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate having the whole of it cut off.
And because of that, O my son, it is necessary for you to know that manual operation is divided into two divisions: namely, operation with which is associated safety: and operation with which there is danger in many situations.
And I have already pointed out in every place in this book where an operation comes which involves terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to avoid that, and to leave it alone, so that fools may not find a way to speak and to bring dishonor.
Therefore take measures with care and caution, and treat your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God’s grace to salvation and laudable success: and leave terrible illnesses of difficult healing: and remove your minds from that which makes you fear, lest hesitation enter into your faith and your well-being.
For it is more conducive to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and ultimately to your rewards.
For Galen already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness: lest you be called bad physicians.
Now however I have divided this treatise according to three chapters.
Chapter one.
Concerning cautery with fire, and cautery with a sharp medicine, chaptered and ordered from head to foot, and the forms of instruments and tools of cautery: and everything which is necessary in the operation.
Chapter two.
Concerning incision and perforation, phlebotomy and cupping, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and similar things: and the whole chaptered, ordered with forms of instruments.
Chapter three.
Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the cure of torsion, and similar things: chaptered, ordered from head to foot, and with forms of instruments.
But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its benefits and harms: and in which complexion it should be exhibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse concerning the quality of the benefit of cautery, and its harm, is a lengthy and subtle discourse, a science, and a hidden secret.
Many wise men have also spoken on it, and they disagreed: and for me, indeed, a little from their discourses suffices, fearing prolixity.
Therefore I say that cautery universally benefits every complexion which is with matter, and without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter.
However, in the hot and dry complexion with matter they disagreed. For some have said that cautery is beneficial in it. And others said the contrary of that, namely that cautery is not suitable in the illness which is from heat and dryness: because the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable that a hot and dry illness be healed with something hot and dry.
And he who says the contrary said: that through cautery help is given in every hot and dry illness which happens in the bodies of men: because when you compare the body of man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I indeed say through his speech: because experiment has already revealed that to me several times.
Nevertheless it is not fitting that he come to that, except he who is already proven and practiced in the chapter of cautery by final exercise, and has known the diversity of the complexions of men, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the duration of time of them.
From the other complexions however there is no fear over you: and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For already all physicians have agreed upon them: and they did not disagree in helping with cautery in them.
And know, sons, that from the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine is: because fire is simple, whose action does not arrive except to the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined with it, except with little harm.
Truly the action of burning medicine arrives at that which is distant from the members: and perhaps it causes to happen in the member an illness of difficult healing, and perhaps it kills.
Fire however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Now indeed that has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and standing upon the truth of things: and because of that I excuse myself from length of speech.
And if it were not that it is not permitted to this my book, I would bring to you a hidden secret in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses with a philosophical demonstrative speech, which would be sharpened by your minds.
And know, sons, that they disagree in the time in which it is fitting to perform cautery, and they place the better time in the spring.
And I say that cautery is fitting at every time: therefore, because harm happening because of time is submerged in the help which is drawn with cautery. And especially if cautery is because of pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate slowness: because it is feared from them that a greater harm may happen than a small harm entering because of time.
And let not that fall into your minds, O sons, which only the common people and foolish physicians do not fear, namely that that illness which is healed by cautery does not always return: and they place that as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cautery is nothing but a medicine in place of that which alters the complexion, and dries the humidities which are the causes wherefore pains happen.
Nevertheless, cautery surpasses medicine by the speed of its healthfulness, and the strength of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the illness may return at some hour of time according to the complexion of the infirm, and the location of his illness, and its strength: and that which is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluities in it: and that which comes to him in its acquisition from foods, and similar things from causes, unless the illness in which cautery is administered happens.
An illness subtle in a member of few superfluities and humidities, such as cautery of a tooth because of pain, and things similar to it, for it is possible that that pain may not return in it. But that happens in few cases.
But truly the talk of the common people again, that cautery is the last of medicine, is right talk: not to that which they intend in it: because they believe that there is no cure which compares with medicine, nor with anything else after the setting of cautery.
The matter, however, is contrary to that, and the intention that cautery is the last of medicine is not, except that when we administer methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help: then we administer cautery at the end of the matter, and it helps: then thence it falls out that cauterium is the last of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
The ancients, however, said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron: and they did not say that except because of the evenness of gold, and the excellence of its substance: and they said that the place of cautery does not produce pus. That is not true absolutely: because I have now proved it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said. However, when you heat a cautery in the fire made of gold, it is not clear to you when it is heated to the amount you want, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches coldness, and if you add more heating to it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Therefore the craftsman falls from it into difficulty: and because of that, cautery with iron is quicker and closer to us, in straightforwardness of operation.
And I indeed have now arranged this Chapter on Cautery, according to chapters: and I have arranged them from head to foot: so that they may ease one seeking what he wants from it.
Chapter II.
This cauterization contributes to the control of moisture and coldness over the brain: which two are causes of headache, and a multitude of the flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and toothache, and sore throat: and universally every illness which happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and headache, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the patient: that he be evacuated first with a cleansing purgative medicine for the head for three nights, or four, according to what the strength of the patient, and his age, and his habit require.
Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor. Then make him sit between your hands squarely, so that he has now placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever therefore your middle finger reaches, mark that place with ink.
Then heat the olive cautery; its form is this.
Then place it on the place marked with ink, descending, so that your hand is gradually tightened, and you will turn it. Then quickly lift your hand and look at the place.
If you see now revealed from the bone the amount of the head of alkiel, or the amount of zeuherbi, then lift your hand. And if not, repeat with your hand the same iron, or with another if it cools, until you see the bones which I told you about.
Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and soak the cautery in it, and place it on the place: and leave it for three days.
Then place on it the cautery soaked in butter, and leave it on the place until the fire eschar is destroyed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment until it is healed.
Now they have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits: wherefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burnt.
Then scrape away what has been burnt of the bone, then treat it.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the ultimate with the cautery, until it makes a strong impression on the bone, so that the bone falls, which is done like the form of kirate: or the instrument which women put in the infusion of small writing: and they think that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it is consolidated.
But to me these two types of cautery do not seem at all suitable except in certain men according to the way of fear.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with its safety.
For the head is weakened by the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified in the other members: and especially when the head of the weak person is naturally weak: and indeed the first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it: therefore work with it safely.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head: and it is prolonged in the patient, and he uses bleedings, and cuppings, and head purges, and oils, and cataplasms. And especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, which we have described, and none of those things benefit him: then consider. For if the patient's head is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery a little below that one. Then cauterize it above every horn of his head with a cautery, until the skin is pierced, and a quantity of bone, which we have described, is uncovered. And cauterize it with one cautery in the occiput of his head, in the place which is called the vessel: and it is the place where a cupping glass is placed: and raise your instrument in this, and do not uncover the bone. For the patient finds because of that a vehement pain, and different from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
And I shall call this cauterization in its place: and it is necessary that it be a cauterization, by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its occiput with a more delicate cautery, than that by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Chapter IV.
When pain and swelling occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with purifying medicines, and the remaining treatment which I described in the divisions of illnesses is administered, and it does not help at all: then cauterization is indicated in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine: or with iron.
Now, cauterization with a sharp burning medicine is as follows: take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides. Then incise the place of pain at the time with a wide phlebotomy knife, until a space is made under the skin, into which the clove is placed.
Then insert it under the skin, until it is hidden: then bind over it with a suitable compress, and leave it for fifteen hours, then unbind it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days: afterwards, apply a cloth soaked in butter to it, until the place produces pus: then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, On Burning Medicines.
Cauterization with iron, however, is done in this way. A fire cautery, whose form is this.
And it is called a nail because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is a certain curve, and in the middle of it there is a small protrusion.
Then place it on the spot and hold your hand; and you slowly revolve the iron quickly; and let the amount that is burned be of the thickness of the skin, as much as half of it. And raise your hand, so that the artery which is below is not burned, and a flow of blood does not occur.
Then soak a piece of cloth in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then place a piece of cloth with butter; afterwards treat with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second knife-like extremity of the cautery. And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly an old one.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in an old hemicrania.
When you treat a hemicrania, with what we said from the preceding treatment, and what we said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that what we said from the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient for it, then it is necessary that you heat the knife-like cautery until it becomes white after you mark on the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that: and put down your hand at once, and press it until you cut the artery, and reach to the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves in mastication, lest the side, or the nerve which moves it, be burned, whence a spasm may result.
And be watchful and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut. For in its excision there is danger, and especially to him who is ignorant of what he does, and is not studious, nor experienced: and he leaves the operation with that in the first place.
And I will come with a recollection of the regime of the flow of blood happening from an artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
But if you see from the sickness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives. For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in earache.
When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and it is treated with resolvents and the other treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and it is that which is called a point, whose form is this.
Then make points with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it is rolled around; or around each, if the pain is in both at the same time. And move the cautery away from the root of the ear a little, after you have marked the places with a hot iron: and let the quantity of cautery be ten points in each ear, and about that.
Then treat the places until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in torticollis.
Chapter VII.
Torticollis which is cured with cauterization is only from the types which happen from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses.
And avoid cauterization of the type which happens from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you treat this type of torticollis with bleedings, and purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize the afflicted person with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and a second a little lower than its temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part. Because softening does not occur except in the part which appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the end of the upper ear, a little below the horn of the head: and another in the temple; whose length should be according to the length of a thumb. And place your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, whose form has been described above: however, it is not a little thinner than that, as you see: and it is necessary that there be a little superfluous thickness in it.
Then treat the place with what preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
When apoplexy becomes chronic, and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and a cautery in the occiput of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of cauterization should be according to what preceded.
Also, cauterization with a cautery over the stomach is done; and this is more extreme.
Then let him be treated with what preceded.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that in the beginning large doses of hiera and pills purifying the brain be given to the sick person.
Then shave the patient's entire head, and apply to the back of his head the mustard plaster described in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times.
For this is the method of cauterization: and do it according to the same order which I there described.
Therefore if he is healed by it, it is good. If not, then make for him three cauterizations in the posterior part of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and place between each cauterization the width of a finger.
Then treat the cauterization with what preceded.
But if you wish an addition, and the patient is able to tolerate it, then make for him a cauterization in the middle. But if you wish an addition, then cauterize it above the two horns.
Then treat it until it is healed, and let the cauterization be olive-shaped according to the form which was mentioned before.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with syringes, and with that which we have said.
Then shave the head of the patient; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery upon each horn of the head, and with a cautery upon the back of it, and with three upon the vertebrae of the neck.
But if you need in the illness a softening of the body with more of those things, and the patient is tolerant, and the illness is severe: then cauterize him with four cauteries upon the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery, until a great deal of his skin is burned, and raise your hand. Then treat him until he is healed: and thus cauterize with olive oil.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
An epileptic is not cauterized, except one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Therefore it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches and with the other treatment that we have mentioned in the division: when the patient is large, or is tolerant in receiving medicines.
But if he is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and masticatories are administered, cleansing the brain, before that for many days with improvement of diet.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner: and with another cautery in the occiput, and above each horn of his head with a cautery. But if the patient is strong and is tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned in the one having paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the manner which preceded.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a small cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in melancholia.
When the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we mentioned in the case of one having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined to melancholia, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him something to drink which will cleanse his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the head of the patient, and afterwards make a properly made bandage of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head; and the patient sitting squarely should be held on all sides.
Then present the liniment. And it is more worthy from old sheep butter. And heat it over a fire with a moderate measured heat, which a finger can tolerate when put into it. Then empty it in the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Do this for the patient once every week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it making very small points of it, except that you hold your hand with the cautery: rather, let it be by smelling.
For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with a quality.
Then place on it a pledget soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a descending flow to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and purge the patient with that which cleanses his head.
And keep him from all dampness, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him on the two temples with two cauteries, if the beginning of the descent of water is in both eyes simultaneously; or from one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye: and cut off with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in the breadth of the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see anything of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting off of them, and caution from the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries ultimately produced.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in old tears.
When the tears of the eyes are old, persistent, and are upon the veins and arteries which are in the exterior of the head manifestly, it is verified that this is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities: then cauterize with the same cautery that I narrated in the beginning of the descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries upon the two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck under the two bones. And if it needs addition, then cauterize it on every side cautiously of the eye, above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the fetor of the nose.
When you treat it with what we said in the division, and the medication does not help: then hasten, and give the patient  infirmocochias to drink for three nights; then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery. Then cauterize it with a nail-shaped cautery, with two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
And beware of the artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the shape of the nail-shaped cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the softening of the eyelid.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, with this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in each part; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not move your hand with the cautery, but according to the quantity which burns a third of the eyelid.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are inverted, pricking the eye.
Cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with fire, or cauterization with a burning medicine.
In cauterization with fire, however, instruct the patient beforehand to remove his hairs, if he is one of those who clean them, until they are lengthened and made even. But if they prick him at their root, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow.
When therefore they grow and are even, then place the patient's head in your bosom; then mark above the eyelid of his eyes with a cautery, a mark which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a pledget soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
Then cauterize over the shape which you marked gradually in many times, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned properly.
And the sign of the health of your work is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye now contract, and the hairs rise up at the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days.
Then place a pledget with butter on it, until the eschar is removed. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some of the hairs return after a while, and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cauterization on that place, as you did at first.
But if the hairs are below, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is level so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
It is that you should instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even. Make from paper or cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take of known soap and of unslaked lime, one ounce of each or thereabouts; then rub them together well and quickly, so that it does not grow cold. Then spread some of it on the paper which you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or both eyelids. And place under the eye a piece of linen soaked in egg white; and let the patient's head be in your lap.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it gently. And you should move it whenever the patient feels the medicine biting; for its bite is found to be like fire.
While therefore the biting which he feels persists, then remove the medicine and move it with your finger. When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised by burning or by incision, it is well: and if not, then apply more of the medicine to the place where the medicine does not take hold and does not blacken, until your work is even, and the eye is contracted.
Then place a cotton compress with butter on it until the burnt skin is removed. Then treat it with diaphnincon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you during the operation to observe the utmost care, lest anything of the medicine fall into the eye.
But if the eyelid softens afterwards, and something from the hairs fights in the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first. Then treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and smallness. Therefore, let your consideration be according to that; and the way of rightness is not hidden from him who studies this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a lachrymal fistula.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your bosom, and let a servant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it is not moved or shaken.
Then place a cotton pledget soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage on his eye; then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's quill from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to be penetrating to the other end, and if you wish it to be upward, try it thus.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then press the fistula, if it is open, and draw out the pus from it, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it, and draw out its pus.
Then place the cautery, made very hot, upon it.
And hold your hand with it a little near the cautery from the eye, toward the side of the nose, so that your hand does not err, or the sick person be disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
If therefore you reach with the beginning of your cautery as far as the bone, it will be well. And if not, then repeat the cautery once, or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Then apply a pledget with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment, until it is healed.
But if forty days have passed, and it is not healed, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine to it, until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which certain early authorities mentioned. Apply to the place of the fistula, and incise it; then place in the incision a thin tube, that is, a thin cannula, of which this is the form. And pour into it the quantity of a drachm of molten lead, and hold your hand with good retention of the cannula, and let the patient not move at all, so that the molten lead does not run, or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place over the patient's eye a compress soaked in egg white, or in water.
For the lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous healing.
If the fistula is healed with what we have said, by cautery and treatment, it is good. And if not, then it is necessary to administer to the opening of the nose, and to reduce the fistula to the nasal passage, according to that which will come to its own proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing fissures of the lips.
Very often fissures occur on the lip, which are called chaps, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, with what we have said in the division of illnesses, and the treatment does not help, then cauterize with a small, knife-like cautery iron, according to this form.
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then quickly place the heated iron in the fissures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Then treat it with cerate until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a fistula of the mouth.
When an abscess occurs in the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it produces pus, and breaks; afterwards it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms: then you treat it, and the treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you apply a cautery according to the size that it occupies in the fistula. Then insert the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and its end; do this once or twice.
Then treat it afterwards with what we have said concerning treatment until it is cured.
If then the pus is cut away, and it heals, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the corrupt bone according to what will come into its head.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the gums and softened teeth.
When the gum is softened because of humors, and the teeth are loosened, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then heat a cautery, whose shape will come after these things, so that you place a cannula over the tooth: and quickly insert the heated cautery into it: and hold your hand a little while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, as you wish.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and spit it out.
For the loosened tooth is made firm, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt humor is dried.
Concerning the method of cauterizing for toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or a worm in the tooth, and treatment with medicines is not helpful: then cauterization is indicated in two ways: either cauterization with butter, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with butter is done as follows: take cow's butter and melt it in an iron spoon or in a pan. Then take a tent and wrap it around the tip of a probe. Then dip it in the melted butter and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat this several times until the effect of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or a tent into cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; and place a heated iron on top of it until the heat penetrates to the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterization with fire is done by using a bronze or iron tube. And let there be some thickness to it so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's bone.
Then heat the cautery to the appropriate shape and place it on that tooth and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either on that same day or the following day.
And it is necessary in the impression of that cautery that the patient fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour; then he should spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, as is possible; and this is the shape of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in strumae.
When strumae are from phlegm and from cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion through medicines, and you wish to digest them quickly: then a concave cautery of fire, whose shape is this.
Having two open ends, so that smoke may exit from the cautery at the other end: and place it, ignited, upon the abscess once, and a second time, if you need it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
But if the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it lint infused in butter, until that which the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth unguent until the fistula is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
When humors overcome the lung canal, and especially when it is with coldness of complexion, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated first with solutive medicines.
Then cauterize it in the uvula at the root of the throat in a depressed place: and beware lest you reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin, except a little of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the juncture of the neck in the last vertebra of it, finishing: and let the cautery be nail-shaped according to the manner which preceded.
Then treat it with what preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the illnesses of the lung and cough.
When cough and illness of the lung are from cold humors, and the infirm one does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the illness is old: then cauterize him with two cauteries above the clavicle in places depressed, soft, empty. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be of a tube according to the form which preceded.
And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, which is named Punctum, whose form preceded in the puncturing of earache: and let the points be from thirty points up to almost others.
Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed.
And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form. Therefore the cauterization is alleviated with it, when you do with it at one time three cauterizations.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated by reason of humors, and is not fixed in the hour of its return from its dislocation, until that is accustomed to return, then it is dislocated by a small movement, which happens as we have already testified, then it is necessary that you reduce the dislocation in the first instance. Then the patient is laid on his back, or on his healthy side. Then lift the skin which is in the inner armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then have a cautery with two prongs. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will be with four cauteries.
And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, wherefore the figure of the cauterization then is of six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of a probe.
And this is the form of a cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added in this way, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Then place crushed leeks with salt on the cautery. Then make the patient adhere to stillness, so that the limb is not moved for some time, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is towards the upper parts, and this rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries by puncturing.
For the joint is strengthened, and the moisture is removed: and the patient is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
When coldness and much moisture occur in the stomach, until they draw it away from its complexion, and catarrhs are multiplied in it, and the methods of treatment are continuous, and do not help: then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back, and extend his legs and his hands. Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cautery under the breastbone the size of one finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on the two sides of one cautery, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular. And space them out so that they do not join together when they produce pus.
And let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without addition: and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery with which this cautery is made be one according to the figure of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for him who is frightened by this cautery: and it is, that you mark on the stomach a point according to the quantity which you wish with a cautery: then cauterize it with a pointed cautery: then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and dampness, or from gross flatulence, until superfluous matter departs from its natural complexion, and the sick man is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the sick man be laid on his back, and you mark with a cautery three cauteries according to this figure, and this same quantity on the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the elbow of a man reaches: and let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of a straight body: and do not press your hand with the cautery very much.
And let the quantity of what is burned be from the thickness of the skin, a quantity of half of it not added: and let the sick man stand on his feet.
But if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who now extends his legs and raises his arms.
This is the form of the cautery.
And it is indeed possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have skill and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to proceed excessively in cauterization, and burn the whole thickness of the skin, therefore burn the whole body, and reach the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
Concerning the method of cauterizing abscesses of the liver.
When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person experiences pain and heaviness without sharpness: and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is intense sharp pain: and you see now, that its treatment has fatigued the physicians.
Therefore, the sick person should lie on his back. Then mark the location of the abscess with a cautery iron; then heat a cautery iron that resembles a ray. And this is its form. And cauterize with it one cautery until the whole skin is burned and it reaches the fat, until all the pus comes out: then treat it with the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
And it is not necessary to use this kind of cautery, except by one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses concur with experience many times: then indeed let him dare to perform this operation.
But truly, to leave it alone is better in my opinion.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
The ancients said, cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy in this manner. And it is that you should take of the dried roots of birthwort, one longer root which is found among them, and let it be like the thickness of a finger. Then immerse it in oil and ignite it in the fire. Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the clavicle with the neck, and with two small cauteries somewhat sloping downwards to the part which is under the chin.
And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib, somewhat sloping towards the back: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. And with three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, lower than the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the cautery, rather let it be evident on the skin by smelling.
And now some ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery of iron similar to a ray: and they ignite it, and internally they insert it into that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess with it, and pus comes out: as we said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with a cautery there is fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, for which there is no healing.
Chapter XXXII. On the method of cauterizing the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen, with that which we have said of treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then cautery in it is according to three methods, which are all correct.
One of which is, that you make three cauteries, or four, in a line according to the length of the spleen, according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, the figure of which preceded.
And let there be between each cautery the quantity of the thickness of a finger, or a little more.
And let the method of cautery be, which we said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the patient be lying on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you ignite a cautery having two prongs, which we said in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus: and raise the skin which is in the direction of the spleen, where the left elbow of the patient arrives: and let your raising of the skin be according to the breadth of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Then insert two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin on the other side with them: then withdraw the cautery: therefore four cauteries are made.
And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then take care of the cautery after you release it, that it emits pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than all the others which preceded it in the treatment.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in dropsy.
Cautery does not fall in dropsy, except for ascites properly.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment which we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery above the stomach, and another cautery above the liver, and a cautery above the spleen, and two cauteries on the back between the vertebrae, and one in the region of the chest, and another in the region of the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it emits pus for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment after the cautery with him: for it is necessary that two intentions be combined for him: and healing will hasten to him with God’s help.
However, the shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized, should be nail-shaped: according to what preceded its shape: and that with which the back is cauterized, should be olive-shaped according to what preceded its shape.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
When abscesses form in a dropsical patient, and are filled with a yellowish water: it is necessary that you cauterize on the dorsum of the foot in the hollow which is between the little finger and ring finger: and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellowish water will sweat out, and the cautery should be according to this shape.
Then make two cauteries on each of the two legs, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made according to the length of the leg, one below the knee, and another lower than that, about the middle of the leg: and on each hip two cauteries: and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time: so that some water sweats out from it: then treat it with the other things which we have spoken of.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in looseness of the bowels.
Chapter 35.
When there is looseness of the bowels from cold and humors, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is treated with methods of treatment, and is not healed: and you see the patient tolerating cauterization of exuberant virtue, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, as preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a thin nail-like cautery: and a cautery over the spleen above the ribs, large, or two cauteries.
And if you see exuberant humors, and the patient tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery over the pubis, and a cautery over each flank: and perhaps you will add two small cauteries over the stomach near the large one.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not fail.
Concerning the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted humors, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries over the lower vertebra of the back below the loins somewhat triangularly, and with a cautery below the navel about two fingers [width].
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face breaking out in pustules, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and with a cautery over his liver, and with another over his spleen, with a nail-shaped cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you cut away the althelul, then heat a cautery that resembles a ray. Then insert it, burning, into the excised althelul: and move your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have related. Then treat them with what benefits them from ointments until they heal.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more ultimate in aid.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter XXXVIII.
When the patient does not submit to the incision and the operation that we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is cured with a cautery.
Therefore, when a fistula occurs in someone, and it becomes old, pus and corrupt humors flow from it. It is therefore more fitting that you should probe it with a thin probe. Then ascertain the extent of its depth with a probe.
Then heat a cautery, which is similar to a ray. Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula and the amount that the nail entered.
And repeat the cautery over it until all the corrupt matter is burned away, once, or twice, or three times, according to your needs.
And beware of burning a nerve, if there is one, or a large vein; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then beware of all these places.
And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think that it is not penetrating.
Then take care of the place until it is healed.
But if the place is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains so for a long time: then know that it is now completely healed.
And if materials are not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or in its depth there is a corrupt bone, or something like that from those: whose remembrance will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from gross flatulence, and the patient's strength diminishes because of it, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the almethen on the kidneys themselves, cauterizing over each kidney with a cautery iron, whose mention preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time in the almeidatu itself. Therefore three lines will result. Therefore the latter will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder from cold and moisture, until the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the pubis above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, and with a cautery on the right side of the pubis, and another on the left: and let the length of that lateral cauterization be according to the size of the thumb's knuckle; and cauterize it with a cautery in the lower part of the back, or with two cauteries, if you need it: and let it be according to the preceding cautery,  a nail-shaped cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the womb.
When cold and moisture affect the womb, and it is prevented by that from impregnation, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and she experiences pain at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above the coccyx in the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
When mucous humors are poured out to the socket of the hip, and become the cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that the leg is lengthened over the other, when they are compared to each other: and the place of the dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the patient above the socket of his hip with a cautery similar to a circle: after you mark with a branding iron around the socket, as it is revolved: and that the socket itself fall in the middle of the circle.
But if this cautery is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of the thickness of all the skin.
Then take care of it, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in sciatica.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and dampness: and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary that you resolve the patient from gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and the like. Then cauterize him.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is, that you cauterize above the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations, according to this form. And make them a good, or bad depth. And let the space that is between each cauterization be the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the cauterization be olive-shaped.
Sometimes however the cauterization is done in the middle above the head of the hip joint itself. Therefore there are four cauterizations.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, with one: so that it is a circle containing the whole hip.
And burn the thickness of the whole skin.
This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries above the thigh, above the place to which the sick person points there, in which there is pain, and with your cautery above the ankle four fingers towards the outer part a little: and let the cautery be knife-shaped.
And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
But if the sick person indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a pointed cautery, three, or four, or more, if he needs it.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-shaped cautery.
And beware in all your cauterization, that you do not go so far with the cautery as to burn a nerve, or a large artery, and thereby draw upon the sick person great harm, or contraction.
And I indeed have already seen one and another, of those who cauterized above the ankle, and went too far in the cauterization, and the leg swelled, until the swelling reached the foot, and it was entirely perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then there followed a looseness of the bowels, and death after that.
But if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each according to this method.
And certain wise men have said, in the cauterization of the hip, whose cautery is of this method. Make a similar iron cautery, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its orifice according to the thickness of a date-stone, or somewhat less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
And let the space which is between each cautery be the size of a thumb-joint: and let the cauteries be open on two sides: and let their height be about a joint, or two joints: and make for them a handle of iron decently fitted to the cauteries.
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows and throws off sparks: then let it be placed upon the hip-joint, the patient lying on his sound side. Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave him for three days. Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days. Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis says, “My son, we have used this type of cautery little, because of the terror of its appearance: and because we have found few who would endure it.”
However, it is one of the good cauteries for him who endures it, and finds with it its place.
The cautery, however, with burning medicines is that you make two samia having a perforated ring, into which descends the hinge of its gate of bronze or iron, the length of the wall; of which in their height are two knots, or as it were the same.
And let the space which is between both be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above; and let that which contains them be together, according to this form.
Then place it over the hip socket, the patient lying on the healthy side. And press your hand very much upon the hip socket. Then pour between the two circles of warm water, which has been heated a little with fire, and hold it for the quantity of an hour; and let the patient endure its biting and its burning, for he will find the biting like fire, until the biting ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the whole hip with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
And put butter on it, until the blackness of the burn is removed: and leave it for several days, and pus will flow from it. For it is the ultimate aid.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the pain extends to the hip or leg: make him stand in what contains water, as you did to the hip equally.
And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, one part of each; grind both, and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which is perforated with one small hole, according to the size of the radius that will enter it; and place under the bottom of the pot another glass pot; and pour over the alkali and lime enough fresh water to submerge both by one finger; after which you compress them with your hand with good pressure; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over more lime; and filter until it is renewed.
For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is used in many medical operations, and in cauterizing other members. Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
And among medicines are those with which ankles are cauterized, also such as tesisie, and cashew honey, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
And Galen indeed, in narrating, related the cure of a certain man from antiquity, by which he was cured of hip pain and sciatica; and he magnified it to be very much so. And he said that he did not need another cure, and that he was healed in one time, until he related that he perhaps entered the bath carried, and came out of it already healed.
And it is so that it is taken from fresh seitaragi; and if fresh is not found, let dry, recent [seitaragi] be taken; and let it be ground much with some fat, and let it be placed upon the hip, where there is pain, or leg, or in the thigh; and let it be bound, and let it remain the amount of three hours, or for the amount that the infirm person feels a lessening of the burning. Then introduce him into the bath.
Therefore, when his body becomes moist, introduce him into the bath. For the pain recedes, and it is healed.
And know that it is not necessary that someone use a cautery with these medicines, except after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides also said that the dung of goats, when the sciatic vein is cauterized with it, benefits it: and the cautery is made in this way. Let wool be taken, and let it be soaked in old oil, and let it be placed on the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle, and is closer to the ankle.
Then take dry goat dung, and burn it in the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished. Then repeat it. Therefore do not cease doing this, until sensation reaches the middle up to the ankle, and the pain ceases.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccine cautery.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from a fall, or from a blow, or from superfluous evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist material: and indeed cautery is not appropriate except in this type alone, which occurs from the infusion of cold material.
Therefore, after evacuating the patient with fetid pills and the like, three lines should be made on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the patient's almeidati, after marking with encaustum five cauteries in each line, or more according to the amount that comes from the patient's tolerance and strength: and the cauterization should be done with a punctate cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a medium nail cautery, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in incipient gibbosity.
This illness often happens to small infants.
And the sign of its beginning in children is that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you find in the last vertebra of the back and its knots that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see this and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular, according to this form.
And let the cautery take on every part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And beware lest you apply the cautery to a hump that is caused by a spasm of the nerve.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in gout and the pains of the joints.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors which are poured out into any limbs of the body, then when pains happen in the feet, it is customary for physicians to call it gout properly.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is so that he cauterizes it after evacuation around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. But if the pains ascend to the knees, or the remaining joints, and this happens many times, then cauterize it above each knee with three cauteries, or four on every side, with this same Clavil cautery.
If, however, more are necessary to you with this cautery, then cauterize it. And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
But if the pains ascend to the knees and the back: then administer what we said of the cautery in its chapter.
But if the pains are in the hands only, then puncture around the joints, as two lines are revolved.
But if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, above every nodule a puncture, and upon the comb of the hand.
But if the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
And do not deprive the infirm from a good regimen, from the reception of medicines. For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ruptures.
When a rupture happens in the groin, and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and it is beginning nearby: then it is necessary that you instruct the infirm to omit eating on his day. And that he use lenitives, so that stool descends from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath, until the bladder or intestine emerges or appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a cautery under the rupture on the pubic bone, with a mark whose end is similar to half a circle towards the upper parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, whose form is this, until it becomes white and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or bladder to its cavity. Then let the assistant place his hand on the place, so that the intestine does not come out: and you have now opened between the legs of the patient, and placed a cushion under him, and another servant over his legs, and another over his chest who holds the hands.
Then place the cautery on the mark, your hand with the cautery standing straight. And hold it until you reach the bone with it; or repeat with it another time, if you have not reached the bone with it in the first attempt.
And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and there results from it for the patient either death or great harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
And it is necessary that the cautery for infants be thin, according to their size.
Then treat with the other ointments until it is healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment for the length of time of his healing, which will soothe his belly: so that the intestine does not come out during straining and defecation.
Then when he wishes to get up after forty days, then apply a properly made bandage, and let him keep it on for another forty days.
And let him be lessened from labor, and from fullness of food and drink, and from loud voices.
For when he uses this regime, thus he is healed with a whole healing.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures with incision in its chapter.
But when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and you wish that they not increase, then cauterize its rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be then as a third of it. Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not increase.
And now some of the ancients have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with a hot iron, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below. And place your hand in the middle with a nail-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in pains due to a fall or blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When pain occurs in some member from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help it, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery of every member be according to its size, and its suitability, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
If therefore it heals from the first cauterization, it is good. If not, then repeat the cauterization on it.
Because it is customary for these pains to move from one member to that which is near it. Therefore it is necessary that you pursue them with cautery, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Lepers, however, are sometimes helped by cautery with the greatest benefit. And especially the type of leprosy which arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore when you wish to cauterize it, consider.
If therefore the leprosy is incipient, and you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and it does not subside, nor remain stable: and you fear for the patient, that corruption might seize upon his whole complexion: then cauterize him upon the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, known, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two upon the two temples, and one behind upon the nape of the neck.
And lastly apply your hand with the cautery lightly, until it imprints a small mark on the skin, and the scabs are loosened from it: so that the exhalation of gross vapors from it may be alleviated, and cauterize also with the cautery upon the spleen itself, according to what has preceded.
But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with those cauteries which we have mentioned on the head, and cauterize upon the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries upon the two jaws, and with two cauteries upon the vertebrae of the neck, and six upon the vertebrae of the back, and one large one upon the haunch near the coccyx and one above it, in the same place: and two upon the hips: namely upon each hip one, and two upon the knees: one upon each knee, and two upon the shoulders, and two upon the elbows, and two upon the soft parts of his chest: and cauterize him upon every joint, of the joints of his fingers and toes: and cauterize upon each heel of his feet, and the palms of his hands.
And beware of the nerves which are upon the back of the heel, lest you burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery upon the pubic bone, and another upon the stomach, and another upon the liver.
And know that the more you add cauterization, the more helpful and beneficial it is.
And know that the patient does not find pain in cauterization, as healthy people do; because his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be of size and smallness according to the limbs and joints, according to what preceded in the kinds of instruments.
Then treat the cauterization with herb flour with honey, and the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in numbness.
When a limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to what the size of the limb, or its smallness, deserves.
And let your cauterization penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And sometimes cauterization is done for a certain numbness which happens in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Truly, let no one presume upon this except he who is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
Chapter 51.
When the albaras becomes chronic and nothing from the arts of medicine benefits it, then cauterize it superficially with a deep cautery, according to the amount of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Then treat it with the flour of the herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon's blood, and swallow's blood: of each let there be one part; let all these be mixed, and spread upon a cloth, and applied to the place until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing cancer.
When cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it is rolled around.
The wise, however, have said that it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery in the middle.
But to me this does not seem good, because I fear that it will ulcerate; and I have already seen this happen several times.
And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
When someone has an adubelati, and it is slow in maturing, either because of an excess causing it, or because of the patient's age, when he is elderly and has little blood, or because of the time, and one wishes to hasten the maturation of the adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries, puncturing. Then leave it. For it itself will hasten with maturation.
But if you wish its perforation with a cautery, then a fire cautery, of which this is the form.
And place it in the middle of the adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from that which follows the diseased area, so that the flow of pus may be relieved.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a corroding ulcer.
Chapter 54.
A corroding ulcer is nothing but a corruption in a limb which moves about and corrodes it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore if you see a corroding ulcer in a place which can tolerate cauterization with fire, then have many fire cauteries, small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place in which the corroding ulcer is.
Then cauterize it on every side until you eradicate the whole corruption, and nothing of it remains at all.
Then leave it for three days, and place on the cauterized areas ground sulfur with oil, until all the eschars and all the corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments which generate flesh.
Therefore if you see that after three days flesh grows with a healthy growth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then repeat the cautery on that which remains of the corrupted areas.
And a corrosive is sometimes medicated with a sharp medicine. For it itself arises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker help: and indeed I have already spoken of its cauterization with a sharp medicine in the division: therefore receive it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Clavi and Warts.
Chapter 55.
Often this ailment happens in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a coarse, filtered thing which harms the foot.
And indeed cautery in them is according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for that with fire, make a concave iron cautery like a vulture's feather: which should be made of iron, according to the size which contains the clavus on every side: and let it have thin edges.
Then place it, burning hot, upon the clavus. Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the clavus, until the cautery reaches the depth of the clavus: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus. Then apply a plaster to it with wild mallows, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on it at night. For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the place with a flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
But if they are not inverted, and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply a cautery to them with warm water: and it is so that you take a small tube of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather: and place it on the clavus, or wart. Then pour a small quantity of warm water into the tube: hold your hand, and revolve it with a slight compression of your hand, so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the clavus, and the warm water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the clavus: and let the patient wait a little for the biting of the warm water for one hour.
Then dismiss him, for the clavus will be eradicated with its roots.
Do this with them one after another, until you have come to all those that are in the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Tremor.
When tremor happens to someone from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries, or five, on the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra a cautery, and on his chest a cautery, and on his stomach a cautery.
For tremor rests with olive cautery, and the healing of the cold illness hastens.
Concerning the method of cauterizing albathir.
Chapter 57.
Sometimes foul albathir, that is, pustules, which are made from gross corrupt materials, are expelled in the body.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary that they be cauterized above every head of the pustule with a subtle cautery with myrtle wood, the end of which is lit with fire. Or with the root of long birthwort. Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner: and they do not increase; and the superfluity making them is broken, and they heal from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Often there occurs a flow of blood from an artery which has been cut in a wound, which happens externally, or in the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and similar things: and it is difficult to stop it.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger upon it: and press it hard, until the blood is stopped under your finger, and nothing comes out of it.
Then put into the fire small olive oil cauteries, and many more large ones: and blow upon them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place in which the artery is broken, and place the cautery upon the vein, after which you quickly remove your finger: and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
But if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery, from the cauteries which are prepared in the fire.
Therefore do not cease doing this with one after another, until the blood is stopped.
And beware lest you burn the nerve which is there, and another harm befall the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods. Or with a cautery, as we have said. Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the bleeding is stopped. Or it is tied with a strong ligature. Or let medicines of a styptic property be placed upon it, and let it be bound with a suitable compress.
But he who manages its excision with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or the application of cauterizing agents, and the like, does not completely help it, except rarely.
But if this should happen to someone, and a physician or medicine is not at hand, then let him begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein, as we have described, and constricting it tightly until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery. And let the finger not be removed from above it, constantly applying very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened, and cut off.
And meanwhile let him consider what it needs of cautery or medicine.
Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds and similar things.
We have already said in the first chapter, every illness in which cautery with fire and burning medicine is suitable, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
And I placed chapters there from the head to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: so that the seeker may be relieved concerning what he seeks.
And before I begin that, it is necessary that you learn, O sons, that in this chapter there is something terrifying, which is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that, caution is necessary in it more vehemently, because in the operation which is in this chapter, very often evacuation with blood occurs, with which life stands in the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of an exit, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death occurs in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that which is hesitant fall upon you, for sometimes there fall to you in this art types of men with types of infirmities. For among them is one who is angered by his illness, and death is light to him: because of the vehemence of what he finds from his illness and the length of its malice. And with illness there is fear that signifies death.
And among them is one who gives his wealth, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is pernicious.
Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such. And let your caution be stronger than your greed and your rapacity. And do not presume upon anything of it except after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which praiseworthy success has come.
And use in the treatment of all your infirm, prognosis and indication of that to which health is suitably directed.
For in that is help for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, O sons, with His understanding, and may He not take away from you direction and inspiration: for that is in His hand.
And I indeed have arranged this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: that the thing which you wish from it, and which you need, may be lightened for you.
Concerning the treatment of water which gathers in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this infirmity often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife constricts the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it also happens from a hidden cause which is not known.
And indeed I have not seen this sickness in others than in children: and to everyone of them whom I saw, death hastened; therefore it seemed to me to omit an operation for it.
And indeed I saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until he could not sit upright because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture is either collected between the skin and the bone, or collected under the bone upon the dura mater.
And the operation in that case, if the moisture is between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head, one in width: and let the length of the incision be about two fingerbreadths, until the moisture flows out.
And this is the shape of a spatula.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions, according to this shape.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side: and the water is depressed when you compress it with your hand towards the interior, and it is not hidden from you: then it is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions, in this manner.
And after the incision remove all the moisture. Then bind the incisions with cloths and powders. Then swab it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then unbind the ligature, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound with equal tightness. And feed the patient with all dry food of little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes it is greater in the occiput, or in the sinciput, or on the right, or on the left.
Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear to you: and incise it as much as is possible for you.
And observe that you do not cut an artery, and that a flow of blood occurs, and that the patient dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Concerning the incision of the arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When catarrhs happen to someone in the eyes, or in the chest, and it becomes chronic, and the treatment of medicines does not help: then the last cure in that is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, the patient must shave his head. Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear. Then the patient should bind his neck with any cloth of his. Then consider where the vein pulsates. And the locations of both are the depressed places which are behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in certain men.
Then mark with a cautery on each: and incise each with a sharp spatula on both sides, the incision reaching to the bone: and let this be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, introduce the spatula under the artery, and incise it upwards with an incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
For when a vein is incised, blood flows out with a pulsating flow, which leaps inwards with a frequent leap.
But if the artery does not appear to the sense, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear a space of the size of three fingers. Then mark with a cautery, and cut down to the bone.
And that which it is necessary to let out of blood, is six ounces and perhaps you let out of it more, or less. All that according to the quantity which appears to you from the strength of the sick person and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound. Then if something of the sifac remains at the bone, then incise it, that a hot abscess may not happen: then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man suffers from chronic hemicrania, or acute catarrh because of acrid humors and heat in the temples, or chronic headache, and similar things, and he is treated with methods of medical treatment, and it does not help: then we have experienced in these sicknesses the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have recounted.
And the method of operating in their extraction is that the sick person should shave the hairs which are in the temples, and should stretch the artery apparent in the temple. For it is shown to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few men, or by the intensity of cold.
But if it is hidden from you, then the sick man should bind his head with any cloth of his; then rub the place with a rough cloth. Or steam the place with warm water, until it appears to you in manifest appearance. Then take the spatula, which I formed a little while ago. Then flay the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery. Then throw a hook into it, and draw it upwards, until you draw it out of the skin, and make it emerge from the tunics which are beneath it on every side.
But if the artery is small, then wrap it with the end of the hook. Then cut from it a part according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and so that a flow of blood does not occur. For if it is not cut and if it is not severed, the blood does not completely ascend.
Then evacuate blood from it, six ounces down to three.
But if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with double, strong thread, of silk or of alhod cords, so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the healing of the wound, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures. Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery as far as the bone, with a knife-cautery, until its ends are seared, and it will suffice for the same work.
And it is a better procedure, unless the patient has a fever or is of a heated complexion. Because cautery is among those things which help to end humidities. Therefore it is a better aid.
And it is necessary after the extraction of arteries that the place be filled with old lint, and that properly made pledgets be placed upon it.
And after the loosening it should be treated with dry medicines which cause flesh to grow, and with linen cloths, until it is healed.
But if meanwhile, while you are operating, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with lint; and squeeze your hand until the blood is cut off. But if none of these things is present to you, then place your finger on the place until the blood clots. And bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness ceases, and it is constricted as much as is necessary.
And of what is lighter and easier in the extraction of an artery, it is to cauterize a vein with this cautery having two knives: and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to an almond. However, they are of much less sharpness than two knives. Because if they are sharp, like two knives, cold hastens to both: and they do not cut the flesh with speed. Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is held in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this therefore the work is better than every work, and lighter, and easier.
And this is the form of the cautery.
And let the space that is between the two knives be the quantity of the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with a cautery: and place both very hot, until they arrive at the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities is lengthened. For they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
Chapter IV.
Concerning the care of sharp, constant lachrymation from the eyes.
When there are constant tears, and their flow is from the veins which are on the outside of the skull, and no medicinal treatment helps, and you see the patient's face becoming red, and he feels a crawling on his forehead, like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded by the corrosion, and his eyelids are heated by the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients used this operation in their treatment, and they called it treatment with the knife.
And it is so that you should order the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead. Then make three equidistant incisions on the forehead along the length of the forehead; and let the length of the incision be about two fingers, and one incision be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little from the movement of the muscles, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries which are on the two sides: and lengthen your hand from the continuation of the two jawbones, and let the space of each incision be the amount of three joined fingers: and let you have a prepared piece of sponge, or many dried cloths, with which you will wipe away the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, whose form follows now. From the incision which is from the side of the temples, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin which is between the two incisions, with the membrane which is above the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision to the second incision. Then remove this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp knife, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side. And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh connected with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision be continued to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, cleanse the places of the clots of congealed blood.
Then place in each fissure a pledget of old cotton, and place over them pledgets soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar. And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day, loosen the ligature, and administer abundant irrigation with lukewarm water. Then treat it with basilicon ointment and other remedies with which wounds are treated, until it heals.
Chapter V.
Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs affecting the eyes from within the head.
When someone experiences acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs, and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their vision already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, painful pain deep in the head, accompanied by sneezing: then understand from these symptoms that those substances and catarrhs do not come except from many veins.
And the best treatment for them is this. And it is that you instruct the patient to shave his forehead. Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to one side, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision reach the bone: and move your hand away from the temples’ muscles, which move during chewing, until the bone is exposed: and you will wipe away all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with old linen or linen threads. Then bind it above with pledgets; and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you unbind it, and you see that the hot abscess is now diminishing: then it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen which causes flesh to grow: such as if you take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of resin: and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Chapter VI.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear.
Whatever falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water and vinegar, and things similar to them; or some animal.
When therefore a stone, or a kind of stone from among those which are not added to, nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then instill into the ear something of violet oil or sesame oil. Then manage its extraction, and make him sneeze with sneezing powder, and block the nostrils at the coming of the sneezing, after you place around the ear pieces of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
For very often it comes out with this treatment.
But if it does not come out, then manage its extraction with forceps, that is, with fine hooks: whose form is this.
If therefore it comes out with forceps, it is good.
And if not, then manage its extraction with a small, thin, blunt hook of few windings.
If therefore it does not come out by that, then make a cannula of bronze, and insert the end of the cannula into the hole of the ear very far, and stop what is around the cannula with wax softened with oil, so that there is no way for the wind except the cannula: then extract it with your strong suction.
For very often it comes out with what we have narrated. But if it does not come out in this way: then take a little of helkalimbat, or of birdlime, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught: and put it on the end of a probe after you have neatly wrapped cotton around it: then insert it into the hole of the ear easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not come out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incise, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of incision is that the phlebotomist first bleeds the patient in the cephalic vein: and extract blood from him according to the measure of his strength. Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its fat in a depressed place: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent, until you reach the stone: then remove it with whatever is possible for you from the instruments.
Then sew up the incision quickly, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains which grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
But if it does not yield to exit, then take a thin, delicate spatula, according to this form.
And administer with it the excision of that kind of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it into many pieces: then extract them with hooks, or with a thin probe, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction is alleviated.
In the case of water entering the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with the head held upright; and he should then fill his ear with a little old lint; and he should lie on that ear in which the water is. If therefore it exits through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, about the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and warm them slightly with fire, and let the patient insert one of them into the opening of his ear: and let him stand on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear. Therefore let him not cease doing that with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
And then the water comes out so that you take one of a pipe cleaner or of a rush, and insert one end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire, until the greater part of it is burned. Then repeat another rush, and do this many times, until all the water comes out: and draw it out with a tube as was previously described for the stone.
But in the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is of small body, like a flea and the like, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, which is apparent to the sense: then manage its extraction with forceps and hooks: and its matter is easier than all things which are held in the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun. If therefore something of worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the form, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the patient tolerates it: then suck with it with strong suction. Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
But if they do not obey you to come out, then stop up the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the case of the stone.
But if they do not come out with what we have said: then administer distillations which the ancients have already experienced in the killing of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring out, by which you pour oils and medicines into the ear, be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. As you see, make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, with a small hole, wide above.
Therefore let that which pushes what is in the concavity of the cannula be made decently of bronze. And if you wish, take a probe and wrap cotton around its end neatly; then pour oil or juice or whatever you wish of these medicines into the cannula; and it shall be in the ear; then insert the probe with the cotton on top and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is driven into the concavity of the hearing, and the patient feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear shall already have been warmed a little with fire; and beware lest that which is distilled into it be very cold, for medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter VII.
Concerning the treatment of blockage happening in the ear.
Sometimes certain infants emerge from the wombs of their mothers imperforate.
And it has also happened to some men that there is a blockage in the passage of the ear from a wound, or from flesh grown there.
And this blockage sometimes occurs in the depth of the opening of the ear, which sight does not reach; and sometimes it happens near the exterior of the opening, and sight reaches it.
Therefore, that which happens in the depth of the ear, and which sight does not reach, is in most instances difficult of healing.
And in that which sight reaches, it is necessary that you put the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look into it: then if you see the apparent blockage, open it with a thin spatula, of which form is that which follows, let its extremity in which there is a certain small width, some part of which is sharp: and the rest of the spatula be of two smooth sides: so that it does not injure the ear.
If therefore the blockage is from flesh grown in the passage of the ear: then hold it with a thin hook, and cut it with strong ease, until all the flesh is removed.
But if the blockage is in the depth of the ear: then take a thin, smooth rod, and heat it slightly with fire: then put it into the passage of the ear.
If therefore you feel the blockage with that which the sick person finds with difficulty of hearing, try its opening with ease: and beware, lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Then put in the ear a small piece of linen according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for a few days, until you are sure of the healing of the wound.
Or take linen, and dip it in rose water, and sprinkle on it crushed verdigris, and use it.
But if you see the ear already festering: then it is necessary that you remove the linen, and replace it with another linen, which you will wrap in cerate which is made with rose oil, until the warm abscess subsides: then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs: then submerge a sponge, or cloths in cold water, and place it over the ear: and use the remaining treatment, which stops the flow of blood, previously mentioned in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of the sty of the eyelids.
Chapter VIII.
Those styes which occur on the eyelids, are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary to grasp them with forceps; or with a hook, and to incise them with a spatula from their roots. Then apply pounded vitriol to the places.
But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after incision. For often they return when something of their roots remains. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of the hailstone-like growths of the eyelid.
Chapter IX.
Very often something occurs in the eyelids which is similar to hail in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called hailstone: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you should then consider if it is a hailstone growing in it, which appears from the eyelid, and moves to every part, and its matter is easy.
Therefore, make a fissure across it. Then scrape it from every side easily until it comes out. Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
But if its excision is not prepared for you except after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the patient in some way.
But if the fissure is large, then join it with a suture and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come from it to you. For the ointment restores it and causes it to grow flesh.
And if the hailstone slopes towards the interior of the ear towards the inner surface, then invert the eyelid and suspend the hailstone with a hook; except that you need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is lengthened by incision, that does no harm in any respect.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the hailstone with salt water: and treat the place with that which causes it to grow flesh, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the axirnath of the eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is fat which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid: and indeed it happens most to boys: and it weighs down their eyes, and catarrhs happen to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them, and because of that you see them lying down on their faces always, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, which swelling has already covered: and indeed the prominence of the axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the axirnath between them.
And the method of its operation is that the sick person puts his head in your bosom.
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare a pledget in it, and make from that pledget a circle according to the quantity that contains the axirnath on every side. Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on every side, so that the axirnath is gathered together in the middle of the circle.
Then make a cut in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, making incisions in width, and let not the incision be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it is necessary that you incise the whole skin, until you arrive at the axirnath, for in many dispositions the axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Therefore extract it with the cloth which you have infiltrated between your fingers to the exterior: and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and beware, lest you add to the incision, so that you do not arrive with the lancet to the eye, and injure it.
But if the axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you should add a little to the incision easily, until the axirnath comes forth. Then extract it, as we have said.
Then submerge cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and bind it with powders.
And some men grind salt, and put it in the hollow of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture may be dissolved.
Then care for it until it heals.
But if it happens in a place of a warm abscess, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
Concerning the ways of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye is softened, whence it happens that it is wrinkled as it ought not to be.
Chapter XI.
When hairs grow on the eyelids in addition to the natural hairs, and grow against them: then they harm the eye, and cause various diseases, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and leucoma, until it becomes the cause of the destruction of the eye.
And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed cured according to four methods. Or by cautery with fire. Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was stated in the chapter on cautery. Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture. Or by tubes, according to what I shall say.
It is necessary that you put the head of the sick person in your bosom. Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it is turned, it is good. And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let that be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a radius.
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula, going from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then remove the thread, and place a small pad of cotton or cloth under the eyelid: then mark above the eyelid with a cautery, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: because this varies in people.
For there are some who require that a large amount be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount that is softened in the eyelid.
Then with a spatula incise upon the two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the incision be one near the natural hairs, like the thickness of a ray.
Then insert a hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then flay it completely. Then unite with a suture the two lips, with needle and fine woolen thread: and wipe away the blood, and make adhere that which superabounds from the threads upon the two eyebrows, with some sticking substances, if you wish to do that: and if not, do not worry.
Then leave the suture and threads for three or four days; afterwards treat it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without suture, and treat it with that which dries and constricts. For the eyelid is raised during the closing of the wound and its uniting: but the future will be better.
The ancients taught this method of treatment, Ataxmir.
Nevertheless, there is concern over the patient, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is also in Ataxmir: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Then raise the eyelid with three hooks separated, or joined together, according to this form which follows, then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with evenness of incision.
But if it is not possible for you to hold a hook, and it is not equal: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger lachrymal, and a second thread near the smaller lachrymal: and gather together between your fingers the threads with evenness.
Then raise your hand with an even raising: and raise the skin over which the cutting has been marked, as we have narrated.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture: and take care of it, until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with cerate, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid also, that its hairs are turned.
Therefore it is necessary that you use in it what we said in the incision: but suture in both is more skillful. Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with canes.
And it is, that you turn back the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is within, according to what I have related. Then skillfully make two canes, or two thin pieces of wood: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width is less than the width of a spathula: and you have already incised at the extremities of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully apply each to that which superfluously protrudes from the eyelid, and bind the two canes on both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days. For the constricted skin will die, and will blacken, and will rot, until it falls off by itself.
If therefore it is slow, then incise it with scissors. Then treat it until it is healed.
When therefore it has consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two tubes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
Chapter XII.
Concerning the elevation of hairs pricking in the eye with a needle.
The operation in this is, that you take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread. Then bring together its ends, and knot each with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place in Alinxotati another fine thread under it shortly, and knot its ends if you wish.
Then let the patient place his head in your bosom, and be near the sun so that the operation may be clear: because it is a fine, or small, operation.
Then insert the needle with the Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you pull it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up above the Alinxotati: and insert that hair into the Alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the Alinxotati into the eyelid with the natural hair.
But if the Alinxotati is pulled, and the hair does not come out with it: you will pull the Alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you have placed in it, until the Alinxotati comes out from the upper hole, and you see it with the sight of the eye: then indeed you will pull the Alinxotati and the thread: and pull out both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
But if the hair is short, then either associate with it a long hair from the natural hairs, and elevate it with it: or leave it, until it lengthens after a space, and then elevate it.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental, therefore, it is made from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operation in it is that you should split that consolidation, and separate its lips, and place between them a pledget of linen, and bind it until it is healed.
And it is not necessary that you should use in its cure things which dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek: and embrocate with water in which has been boiled mallow, linseed: and diachylon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil: and wrap with it a pledget, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your cure is that you strive with all your skill that it may not consolidate according to the form which it had at first.
And this operation which we have spoken of is nothing but a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not entirely return to what it was.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati which occurs below is that which is truly called Alxatrati. And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And accidental occurs from a wound, or fissure, or cautery, and similar things.
And the method of operating on it is that you take a needle in which there is double thread, and you insert it into the flesh, and you make it penetrate from the left lachrymal to the right lachrymal, until the thread arrives at both extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and incise it with a broad spatula. If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it ought, it is good.
And if not, take a radius, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and an angle is made from them: until when they are joined their figure becomes this figure, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid. Then join the separated parts: sew it with linen thread.
Then treat them with what we have spoken of, emollient medicines and linen cloths, until they are healed.
And if an abscess occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, even as has preceded. Then separate between the two lips with a linen cloth, as we have said.
And the sum of the discussion of the treatment of an abscess, when it is above, or below, is, that the operation should be performed, according to what is prepared in the form of an abscess.
For it is of many diversities in form: and a skillful surgeon prepares a method with whatever way is possible for him, until he restores the form to the natural form, or near it, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many preparations.
Chapter XV.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Sometimes this consolidation happens to many men, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the white of the eye, and prevents it from its natural functions.
Therefore it is necessary that you insert the end of a probe under the eyelid, and lift it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then incise the adhesion with a thin spatula, which is not with the sharpness of cutting spatulas, but rather somewhat blunt: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and injures the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you are scraping away that adhesion easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the whole adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, wash it with water: or distill into it from a sieve made, from ziniar dissolved with water.
Then separate the eyelid and eye with a linen cloth: and place on the eye wool infused with egg white: and after the third day use a sieve, and with solidifying agents, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the eminence of flesh of the tear ducts.
Chapter XVI.
Know that a nail is according to two methods. Or it is sinewy: and it is similar to hard, thin fat. Or it is not sinewy, similar to congealed white moisture: which when iron touches it, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not fix in it.
And both types do not begin except from the larger tear duct, until it gradually goes, until it covers the sight, and prevents light and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operating on its incision is: that the sick person puts his head in your bosom. Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand. Then collect the nail with a hook of little curvature, and extend it upwards. Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hair of a horse, or ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread, and extend it upwards: and flay with the hair the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair to its end.
Then incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct, so that a constant flow of tears may not result from its incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone; or with thread, as we have said. Then scrape it with a smooth spatula, of which this is the form.
And beware lest the spatula touch the corneal tunic, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be perforated.
Then after the incision, throw into the eye some crushed salt, or a poultice made from ziniar, and leave it until the next day. Then treat it with what is necessary, until it is healed.
But if the nail is not fleshy, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor can a hook be fixed in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicines, and is healed as I have described in the division.
But if you wish to incise it, then open the eye of the patient, and take a thin, smooth spatula, of weak sharpness, according to this form. And shave the nail from above carefully with subtlety. But if you see that it is thinned and broken, and the shaving impresses itself upon it, then instill from your hour into the eye a solution made from ziniar, or from red copperas, or crushed salt: and close the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation on it until the whole of it is removed. Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye contrary to this: for then leave it, and treat the abscess until it is healed.
Then repeat the operation on it carefully until it is healed.
However, if the prominence of the lacrimal flesh causes great harm to the eye, suspend it with a hook, and incise a part of it: and do not extend the incision, lest the flow of tears be affected.
Then instill into the tear duct red wine, or something made from verdigris, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and the flesh growing in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes a red, composite flesh grows in the eyes of some people, either superimposed until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or constricts it over the eyelids, and perhaps inverts the eyelids outwards: and it resembles a wild rose.
And the operation in it is also that the infirm person puts his head in your bosom. Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with hooks suitable for it: and hold it with one forceps, or instrument.
Then incise the flesh first, until all of it is finished with a scalpel. And beware of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, with which you incise it, be either with a spatula, which we have described in the incision of the nail: or with small scissors, with which the asebel is collected, according to what its form will be after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is completed, and all the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distil into it red powder, and things similar to it from corrosive medicines: and place over the eye outside a cotton ball with egg white: so that it may be protected from a hot abscess.
But if some alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which soothes the abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
And similarly do with the added flesh which happens in the eye from this species.
However, it is necessary that you avoid treating any weak eye, from a natural or accidental cause, by operating with iron: and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that the member is able to tolerate that operation.
Concerning the removal of a cataract from the eye.
Chapter XVIII.
Cataracts are red veins which are woven over the eye, and prevent the vision from performing its function; and they weaken the eye with the passage of time.
Therefore it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which is the cataract is strong, and there is in it no illness whatsoever besides the cataract: then remove its cataract.
And it is [the case] that you instruct the patient to place his head in your bosom.
Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your judgment; and let the hook be a fine double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks joined in one body, according to this form.
Then collect with fine scissors those veins delicately, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and they are resolved; and beware lest you injure the eye with the points of the spatula.
And let your operation be at midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not cut except those veins.
And when you have finished, then instill into the eye green or red vitriol, so that by its sharpness it corrodes what remains of the sebum.
But if it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye, and leave it for a few days, until its pain is settled and it is secure from a hot abscess; then repeat on it in the same manner, until it is healed.
And this is the shape of the scissors.
Concerning the reduction of the Arisatum to the nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call Arisatum a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharp burning medicine, according to what its account has preceded.
And if it is not healed, then there is no remedy for it: except that you should incise above the abscess at its origin, and draw out all the moisture which is in it and the pus, until the bone is uncovered.
When therefore the bone is uncovered, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
And it is called the head of the rough file.
Let it be made of untempered iron, and let its head be round like a chisel, which should be pointed with the point of a file, or with the point of an aliskilfer, with a fine point: and place it upon the corrupted part of the bone.
Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand gently, until you know that that corruption has been scraped away: and do this several times.
Then restore the place with drying and styptic medicines.
If therefore the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus is stopped, and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not fester, and no accident happens to it: then know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is nothing to do but to reduce the fistula to the nasal opening, according to this method.
And it is that you uncover the second bone with an iron or with a sharp instrument: and when the bone is uncovered, then take a drill of this form, let its iron end be triangular: and let its wooden part be a pyramid tapering to a point, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself: and let it be near the lacrimal duct: and move your hand a little away from the eye. Then rotate your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: by this, that he finds wind coming out of it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with drying styptic medicines, as I taught you.
When therefore flesh grows, and the place hardens: then the matter which was discharged externally, returns to the nose: therefore it is easier on the patient.
Concerning the reduction of a protrusion of the eye.
Chapter 20.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision: then it is necessary that you loosen the patient; then you bleed him; afterwards you apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then place on the eye an ointment which is made from acacia, and aloe, and frankincense, and sarcocolla. Then bind the eye from above with a plaster with many powders.
And the method of the powders is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth of them is doubled four times: make many of them: then place them one upon another, according to the quantity which the eye needs: then bind over them with a hard cloth with a strong binding.
And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound day and night.
But if the bandage is again loosened, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly: then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said.
If therefore you see the eye has returned to the tunic of the grape, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and the powders, and the binding, and the cupping glasses, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the grape tunic.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the tunic of the grape, then it protrudes and comes out beyond the eyelids like a grape seed, and the man's appearance is disfigured because of it, and you wish to incise it: then the operation in it is, according to what I relate: and it is, that you insert a needle into the root of the grape from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle in which is a double thread from the lachrymal side, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Then incise the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the grape around the needle; and tighten it very much.
Then withdraw the needle, and place on the eye wool infused in egg white; and leave it until the thread falls off with the grape.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
And sometimes the grape is constricted on every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds a large prominence.
Then it is perforated with a thin spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the white humor flows out, and the eye descends, and immediately enters; then constrict it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnati.
Chapter XXII.
This sickness which is called Alcomnati is nothing but pus which gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
And the method of operating on it is that you make the sick person sit on a prepared or straight seat.
Then take his head with your hands from both sides, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts of your eyes. Then it is fixed, and does not descend, and the light is resolved: and the sick person sees things as he saw: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula, and incise with it above the corneal membrane a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the circle, until the pus comes out.
When therefore it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then let it be treated with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of water which descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already spoken of the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for perforation by declaring and explaining speech, then take that same thing according to the health.
Then therefore it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands squarely, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and bind it tightly: then the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which is the water is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then take with your right hand an almond, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Then place the end of the almond near the cornea by the thickness of a ray in the very apparent whiteness of the smaller lachrymal eye: then push the almond with force: and you revolve with it your hand, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the almond has now arrived at the empty thing.
And it is necessary that the measure of the almond's journey to the depth be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and that is the crown of the eye. For you will see them in the very pupil by the vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Then place the almond up to the place where the water is. Then press it downwards one time after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the infirm person sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the almond in his eye.
Then rest a little. If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, except that the almond comes out.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the almond with ease: and you roll your hand gradually.
Then dissolve something of clear rock salt in water: and wash the eye inside with it. Then place outside the eye a whole pledget, or wool infused with rose oil and egg white: and bind with it the sound eye.
But we, and those who are of our time, place on it crushed cumin with egg white.
But if the almond does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, because it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a spatula, which is called Alberid, whose form is this.
Therefore pierce with it only the conjunctiva, and do not thrust your hand into the opening: and it is only to make a subtle way for the almond to its place.
Then insert the almond, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, let a properly made bed be prepared for the patient, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and let him be forbidden all movements, and coughing: and give him food which soothes his nature: and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage remain in its place until the third day.
Then loosen it in that dark room, and test his sight: and make him see things. Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that he do this at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather, it is necessary that he avoid it; because water rises quickly through vehement gazing.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh [day]: and rectify it with that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed: then restore its sight, and place on his face an oral [medication] by which his sight may be governed under it for a few days, he himself remaining in that dark room.
Then let him go out from the house gradually, and converse in his own houses.
And know that in the cautery the student is not excused from vision at times: for then let him dare to perform the operation.
And now indeed there has come to us a certain one of those who are from Alayrach, who said that there was made in Alayrach a perforated magdan, by which water is sucked.
Truly therefore I have not seen anyone in your land who has made that: nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients: and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the kinds of magda, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon them.
Let them be made of bronze properly; and let their ends be triangulated with this same subtlety, and a sharp point.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the care of flesh born in the nose.
Sometimes diverse fleshy growths are born in the nose, of which some resemble a scorpion with many legs; and of these there is cancerous flesh, stony, dark in color; and of these there is flesh that is soft, not dark in color.
Therefore, in that which of these fleshes is soft, not malignant, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the infirm person sit between your hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and throw a hook into that flesh; then draw it to the exterior, and incise what you have grasped of it with a thin, sharp spatula from one side, until you know that all the flesh has now been removed.
But if something remains of that whose excision is not possible, then shave it with one of the thin instruments easily, until nothing of it remains. But if the blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs, then oppose it as is necessary; or if it is of malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Then vinegar and water, or wine, should be thrown into the nose after the incision. But if the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that he is now healthy.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it there is flesh grown in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Then it is necessary to insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place between each knot the amount of a finger, or less; and let the patient put one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made a similar azer; and let him pull his scent until it reaches the abscess, and comes out over his throat.
And indeed boys often do something similar to this in schools; and it is an easy thing for whoever wants to.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which comes out over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose. Then take and remove the flesh with the knots that are on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread: and after wiping away the blood, put a pledget that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment into the nose; do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then finally put a lead tube in the nose for a few days, until it heals.
If, however, it needs treatment that dries, use that.
To make a head-purger, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or bronze: let it be similar to a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for making a head-purger should be full, open; to which there should be a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish of juices and liquid things.
Chapter 25.
Often a polypus is born in the extremity of the nose, and it is magnified, and increased with the days, until its appearance becomes foul.
And because of that it is necessary that you cut it in the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate the whole of it. Then place on the location, either a cautery, or a burning medicine which stands in its place.
If therefore its incision is delayed, until it is magnified, then consider, if it is stony, hard, of a dark color, of little sensation: then do not touch it with iron: because it is a cancerous abscess.
For many times I have seen, he who incised such an abscess, and great harm happened from it to him who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not of a dark color, and you see that incision is possible in its entirety, then evacuate the diseased area, and incise it without fear, without dread: and treat the place with that which dries and constricts, until it is healed.
Chapter XXVI.
Concerning the suture of the nose, and lip, and ear.
Know that when a discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, the operation benefits little, except in certain men.
Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you ought to consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood; and then bring together the two lips of the wound with suture; then treat it until it is healed.
And if the lips of the discontinuity are already separated, and each part has become healthy: then it is necessary to scrape away all the part from its apparent skin until it bleeds. Then bring together the two lips with suture, and bind them, and powder over it dragon's blood and crushed olibanum: and place over the powders a piece of diachylon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it bound for two or three days. Then unbind it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads are cut off by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of suture is to bring together the discontinuity, either with needles, as we have recounted in the suture of the belly: or bring together the discontinuity with thread, as I have made you know.
Chapter XXVII.
Concerning the extraction of knots from the lips.
Indeed, many people often have hard abscesses in their inner lips, similar to grains of barley: and some of them are smaller, and others larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you turn back the lip, and incise over each knot, and suspend it with a hook, and incise it on every side.
Then fill the place after the incision with powdered alum, until the bleeding stops.
Then let it be washed with vinegar, and let the place be treated with it, in which there is astringency, until the wounds heal.
Chapter XXVIII.
Concerning the incision of flesh grown over the gum.
Often flesh grows over the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.
Therefore it is necessary that you suspend it with a hook; or hold it with forceps, and incise it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
Then place pounded egg white or other drying, styptic powders on the area.
But if that flesh returns after treatment—for it often returns—then incise it a second time and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
Chapter XXIX.
Concerning the treatment of teeth with iron.
Sometimes rough, foul crusts gather on the surfaces of the teeth, on the inner and outer parts, and between the gums; and sometimes they blacken, and become yellow and green, until corruption from them reaches the gums, and the teeth become foul through it.
Therefore you ought to make the patient sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth where you see crusts and things like sand, until nothing of them remains; and similarly do with the blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other things until they are clean.
If therefore that which is in them is removed from the beginning of the scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second, and a third, until finally you achieve your purpose.
And know that a tooth needs scrapers of diverse shapes and many forms, according to what is prepared for your operation; because the scraper with which a tooth is scraped from below is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other shapes.
And these shapes of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you see.
Chapter 30.
Concerning the extraction of aching teeth.
It is necessary that you treat a tooth from its pain with all skill, and delay in its eradication. For there is nothing that can replace it when it is eradicated, since it is a sublime substance: until when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary, when the patient is compelled to eradicate it, that the aching tooth be steadied and made certain for you.
For often pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in a sound tooth and eradicates it: then the pain does not depart, until the diseased tooth is eradicated.
For we have already seen this from the operation of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is made certain for you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side: then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you shake it.
Then place large forceps on it with a good placement, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have now held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it on every side easily, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
But if the tooth is perforated, or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth: and bind it with the end of a thin rod, so that it is not broken at the time of your tightening on it with forceps.
And it is necessary that you act exquisitely with scarification around the gum on every side abundantly.
And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and part of it remains, and returns upon the patient from that malice which is greater than his first pain.
And beware lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and boldness concerning its eradication, beyond what we have described.
For many times they cause to happen to men great infirmities, which are more difficult to break, and its roots all remain, or some of them; or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw: as we have many times testified to that.
Then let it be washed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
But if a flow of blood happens from the place (for it often happens), then grind something of zegi, and fill the place with it: and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is moved at first, should have long ends, a short handle, thick, so that they are not doubled when pressed with them upon the tooth: let them be like you see of thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not injure themselves, nor double: of short ends, and let them be made of good iron, or of steel decently made, of straight ends: and at their ends let there be teeth, some of which enter into others, and grip with a decent, strong constriction.
And sometimes the ends are made like the shape of the mouth of a bird which is called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
Chapter XXXI.
Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured jaw bones.
When something remains from a broken tooth at its eradication, then it is necessary that you place a poultice with butter on the place for one or two days, until the place softens: then insert into it an elevator, or forceps; the ends of which resemble the mouth of a bird which is called a stork. Now this is the form of the forceps.
Let their ends be made like a file inside: or like *aliskilfegi*.
If therefore it does not yield to you to come out with these forceps, then it is necessary that you carefully expose the root, and uncover all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short in the extremity, somewhat thick: and let it not be soaked, lest it break.
If therefore the root comes out by means of that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to help with these other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first is triangular at the end, in which there is a certain thickness.
The form of a triangular end, slender.
And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the matter of teeth.
Also let there be help with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of this form, with a twisted triangular end, in which there is some thickness, so that it is not broken: and let it not be imbibed.
And know that the instruments for teeth are many: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and a skilled craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument, according to what the operation and the illnesses themselves signify to him.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not mention an instrument, because of the diversity of their kinds.
But if a bone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then examine it in its place with that which is suitable to it from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with a gest, whose form is this.
Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone may be tightened, or held with it, and not escape and go, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with medicines suitable to it.
But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter XXXII.
Concerning the sawing of teeth prominent above others.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, the form is made foul thereby; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, those who are for sale.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider. For if a tooth is grown after another tooth, and is not located, or its sawing or filing is possible, then eradicate it; and if it is joined with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of strong iron, very sharp at the tip.
And let your incision, by which you cut it, be in many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not moved.
But if it is prominent and exposed to its filing, then file it with a file of iron, of which this is the form.
Let it be entirely of iron, and its handle of very small points, like a file with which needles are made; with which the tooth may be filed little by little in many days easily, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then smooth it, finally shave it with certain razors.
But if it is a tooth, from which a part is broken, and injures the tongue: then it is necessary that you file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is leveled, and smoothed, and does not injure the tongue, nor impair speech.
Chapter XXXIII.
Concerning the retention of teeth with gold threads.
When a concussion and shaking of the front teeth occurs from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats lest it fall out, and you have treated them with styptic medicines, and the treatment has not availed: then the method is that they be bound with a gold thread; for silver turns green and rots after days; but gold never changes.
And let the thread be medium in fineness and thickness according to the amount it should occupy between the teeth.
And the manner of binding is that you take the thread, and insert a double portion of it between two sound teeth; then weave with the two ends of the thread between the moved teeth, whether it be one or more, until you reach with the weaving to a sound tooth on the other side. Then repeat the weaving to the part from which you began; and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not at all removed; and let your constriction, with which you tighten the thread, be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not come loose.
Then cut off the superfluous ends of the thread with scissors; and join both, and twist them together; and hide them between the sound tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue; then let it remain so bound.
But if it loosens or is cut, bind them with another thread, and it will remain so for the whole time.
And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the binding of two sound teeth, and of two moved teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after the fall of both, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and this is done only by a skillful, prudent, and experienced craftsman.
And sometimes something from the bones of animals is fitted: and it is made into the form of a tooth, and is placed in the place, from which the tooth is strengthened and bound, as we have said: and it remains, and serves for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue, is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound which has already healed.
And the operation in it is, that you open the mouth of the sick person at his head in your lap, and lift up his tongue: then incise that nervous ligament across, until the tongue is released from its restraint.
But if in it there is something of hardness and knotting, and it is from the healing of a wound: then throw into it a hook, and split it across, until you incise the ligament, and the knotting is released.
And beware, lest there be a fissure in the depth of the flesh, and you incise an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then let the place of the incision be washed with rosewater, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Then place under the tongue a linen pledget, which the sick person should hold throughout the night: so that it does not heal up again.
But if a flow of blood occurs, then place pounded alum on the place. If however the blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a slow cautery, which is suitable for it; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue which resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it is magnified so much that it fills the mouth.
And the operation in it is that you open the mouth of the sick person before the sun: and consider the abscess.
If therefore you see it of a dark or black color, hard, to which the sick person feels no sensation: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
And if it inclines towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then throw into it a hook, and incise it with a thin spatula, and free it from every part. But if blood overcomes you at the time of your operation, then place on it crushed alum until the bleeding stops: then return to your operation until you extract it with its entirety.
Then let it be washed with vinegar and salt: and treat it with the remaining appropriate treatment for it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
Sometimes abscesses occur between the throat glands, that is, glands which resemble the glands which occur externally: and they are called the two tonsils: which when you treat with what we said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
If therefore the abscess is hard, dark in color, and has little sensation: then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red in color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood, but rather leave it until it matures. And then either you will pierce it, or it will break by itself.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then it must be incised.
And the procedure in it is that you consider before its operation, if the heat of its abscess has quieted completely, or is diminished by some lessening: then therefore have the infirm one sit before the sun, and let his head be in your lap: and open his mouth, and let a servant take [a tool] between his hands, and press his tongue down with an instrument, whose form is this.
Let it be made of silver or bronze, which is thin like a knife.
When therefore you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your vision falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it outwards as much as you can, except that you draw something of the tunics with it.
Then incise it with an instrument, whose form is this which follows. It is similar to scissors; however, let its ends be curved, so that the opening of each is directly opposite the other sharply: therefore take care that it is made of untempered iron, or imbued with alfuled.
But if this instrument is not present, then incise it with a spatula, whose form is this. Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you incise one tonsil, incise the other according to this same kind of incision.
Then after the incision let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
But if a flow of blood happens to him, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and things similar to those from styptics, until the flow of blood is stopped: then take care of him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses are produced in the throat, besides the two tonsils. Therefore incise them according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I myself indeed once treated a woman from an abscess which had formed between her throat, which was drawing towards blackness, little feeling, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her eating, and drinking water: and she had already come to death, if she had remained one day, or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had put out two branches, until they came out above the two openings of the nose.
Therefore I made haste, and fixed a hook in one of them. Then I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out from it.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the opening of the nose.
Then I did to the other what proceeded from the other opening of the nose.
Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue: and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess: then I cut off a part of it, and nothing ran from it but a little blood: therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took food.
Therefore I did not cease to cut into that abscess many times for a long time: and the abscess succeeded in the place of what I cut, until it was excessively prolonged and with it that.
Therefore I devised, and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore it stopped from addition: then I walked away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
Concerning the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Chapter 37.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and becomes an abscess, and is long: then it is called perpendicular: and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: and you see that the hot abscess has subsided from it, and it is thin: then it is necessary to incise it.
And what is aggregated from it is round, and it does not have length, and is bloody, or brown in color, or black, and it does not have sensation: then it is necessary to avoid its incision. For in it there is fear for the patient.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I described, from its whiteness and its length, you should make the patient sit before the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument, the description of which preceded: then fix a hook in the uvula, and draw it downwards: and incise it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you not incise from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you incise more of it, you will injure the voice and speech.
Then after the incision use what we have described in the incision of the two tonsils: and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision: then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
And the method of cauterization in it is not, except with a sharp instrument; and it is that you place the head of the patient in your bosom. Then press his tongue with the instrument which we have described. Then take of the water which I told you in the chapter on cauterization, and mix with it some quicklime not slaked, and put it not thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the form.
Let there be at its extremity, where the medicine is placed, a concavity like the concavity of a spoon.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself; and let the patient lie upon his side, so that the saliva may flow from his mouth from the inside of the medicine, so that nothing from it may descend to his throat and injure him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine. And you apply it to the uvula for half an hour, until you see it blackened, and the biting of the medicine quieted.
And if you wish to take a pledget, and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and soak the pledget with medicine, and insert the spoon with the pledget into the cannula from above, until the pledget adheres to the uvula.
Do this many times, until you obtain what you desire of the cauterization of the uvula. Then leave it: for it dries and falls off after three or four days.
But if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe around the uvula with a pledget soaked in butter, and clean it of what remains around it from the medicine: and rinse with cold water.
And treat externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Therefore this method of treatment is healthier than incision and further removed from fear.
And sometimes the uvula is cured even with something finer than cautery and incision: for it is cured with fumigation, in this way. Take calamint, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and sage, and chamomile, and southernwood, and similar herbs: and combine all of them, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil: and let the pot be luted with clay properly: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this way.
Let it be made of silver or bronze: and let the end, in which there is a pomegranate, be inserted into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is very darkened.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, lest you do this cure at the beginning of the arrival of the abscess. For it often adds to the abscess: and it is not fitting that you do it except at the decline of its warm abscess.
But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube, and place on its end the shell of an egg: so that the mouth of the sick person is not burned: because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is of good healing with health.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter 38.
Often a bone, or fish bone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore it is necessary that you extract what of them is apparent upon which the sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument towards the sun, and it is declared to you what is in the throat.
And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the infirm person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach. Perhaps then the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Or let the infirm person swallow a piece of turnip, or the root of lettuce, or swallow a morsel of dry bread: or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge: and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it. When therefore it arrives at the place where the splinters or bone are, and is extracted, then it comes out.
If therefore it does not come out with what we have said: then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be somewhat thicker than a radius, and at its end let there be a curve, which he may easily insert into his throat; and let him have his head raised upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest coughing should occur, and drive the bone or splinter in, or let the physician insert it with his hand.
But what the infirm person inserts is better, because of his knowledge of the location of the attached thing; and let him push downwards, or draw his hand upwards with the instrument, all of it according to the quantity prepared for it, until it comes out.
Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Chapter 39.
When a leech is treated with what I mentioned in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then examine the throat of the sick person in front of the sun, or by the sun, after pressing his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine tweezers delicately.
But if it is not possible with these: then take a concave tube, and insert it into the throat of the sick person as far as the throat: then insert into the concavity of the tube a piece of iron heated with fire. Do this many times: and let the sick person abstain from water the whole day.
Then let him take a glass full of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand. For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls down.
But if it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the sick person with bugs, or with asafoetida with the instrument which I described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this many times, because it itself will fall.
And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals with fire: and the pot is covered with a cover, in the middle of which is a hole: and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then throw in the fumigation, and let the sick person put his mouth on the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not come out, until you know that the fumigation has now reached the leech. For the leech will immediately fall.
But if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salty things and garlic, and not drink water.
Therefore it is necessary that it comes out with this regime.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon the uvula itself.
It is similar to forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat. And its extremity is similar to the beak of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is a roughness like a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and treatment in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many kinds of abscesses, of many types, according to the recollection of them, namely one, and one in this book: and they differ in their perforation, and incision of them in two ways.
One of which is from the species of abscess in itself, and that which it contains of humors.
And the second method is because of the places in which it happens in the body.
Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints: and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And among abscesses there are some which it is not necessary to perforate, except after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion: and among them there are some which it is necessary to perforate while they are raw, and not matured according to completion.
Such as abscesses which are near the joints.
Because when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its duration is prolonged until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: wherefore it is a more proximate cause of the contraction of that member.
Or there is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either it, or through it the principal member.
Or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it immature: and it is not necessary to perforate a raw abscess, of incomplete digestion, except that which is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its end that which is not healed.
It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of an abscess which is matured according to its completion: and it is at the sedation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and acuteness of the head of the abscess: and other signs.
And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the abscess, and of more vehement prominence: and let the perforation go in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of muscles, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and lastly in all equal places, in which there is no reflection.
But in those which are reflected, proceed with the perforation according to that member.
When however the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better that you delay its perforation, until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much dirt and filth, and perhaps its lips and its depth are hardened.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the breadth of the body when necessary: or according to that which the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer in small abscesses a small perforation, and in large abscesses a large perforation: or many incisions according to the likeness of the size of the abscess.
And there are some abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin is hollowed out: and incised when it has become like a cloth, and has become in the end, that it is already dead: like that which happens in many, as in boils and buboes.
And some of them are those which are cut with a three-angled incision. And some of them are such that it is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like the abscess of the groin.
And some of them are those in which a round incision and a lunate incision are administered: and similar to them from among the incisions.
However, that which does not have a head, such as are soft superficial abscesses, it is necessary that you perforate it with a superficial perforation, or a flat one only.
And it is necessary, when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, that you do not hurry and extract all the pus at that time: but rather extract some of it. Then plug the abscess until another day. Then extract some of the pus again.
Do this many times gradually, until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit person; for the vital spirit is often dissolved from the body with the exit of pus: and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not notice.
Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, by which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you clean the wound: and consider. Therefore if the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is smooth, then apply a linen cloth, or old tow. And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures of the perforation, then it is necessary that you insert a linen cloth into each fissure, until they meet.
And if you have cut away a part of the skin in the abscess, or hollowed it out around: then it is necessary that you fill it with old tow, or as when cloth is woven, or shaved linen fluff without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary of ointment, until it is healed.
But if a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after a cloth is soaked in them: and apply it to the place of the blood flow many times.
But if the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and treatment, and powders, which I have recounted in many places of this our book, and from the division.
But if it is in the time of winter, and the place of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you infuse little bags with warm wine and oil: and place them on the places.
And if it is in summer, and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place small bags soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all that cold. Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you dissolve the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer in its treatment that which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
This therefore is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
According to the way of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how there is a way to its treatment chapter by chapter individually.
Chapter XLI.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which happen in the skin of the head.
Small abscesses happen in the skin of the head, and they are of the kinds of Nodes, which contain membranes, which are sacs for them: as if they themselves were the wattles of a hen.
And their kinds are many.
Of them some are fatty; and of them some contain a humidity similar to mud; and of them some contain a humidity similar to cooked vegetables and porridge; and similar to them; and of them some are hard and stony.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, provided that in their incision an artery is not injured.
And the operation in their incision is that you should explore them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if that which it contains is humidity, then incise it with a longitudinal incision, a superficial incision: according to this form.
And begin with the incision from line b. to line g.  When therefore the humidity is evacuated, then scrape the cyst which contains that humidity, and do not leave anything of it at all.
For very often it returns, if anything of it remains.
Then dip a pledget in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day. For it will corrode what remains of the cyst.
Then repeat on it with a pledget with Egyptian ointment a second time, and a third, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing of the cyst remains; then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
But if the abscess contains a fatty nodule, then cut it according to this manner, the incision having the form of a cross: and throw hooks between the lips of the incision, and scrape it from every part: and exert your strength in extracting the membrane which contains it.
But if an artery opposes you, then do what I shall tell you afterwards.
And similarly act in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said.
And the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because it contains little blood and moisture. And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in certain men, with which there is altogether no moisture.
That is: because I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman, and I found an abscess like a solid and hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken; and if anyone were to strike with it by throwing, it would wound him.
In other abscesses however occurring in the head, besides these namely abscesses which occur in the heads of children, and near the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Or place their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus is eased downwards.
Then treat them with what is suitable for them from treatment.
Concerning the incision of strumae in the neck.
Chapter XLII.
These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin; and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And concerning those which of them occur in the neck, there are some single and many; and they are generated from one another; and every struma of them is within a membrane proper to it, just as it is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the kinds of these strumous swellings are many. And of them some are stony; and of them some contain humors; and of them some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that one of them which you see to be of good disposition to the touch, whose manifest color is near to that of the skin, and moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the jugular vein, nor to the artery, nor is deep: you ought to cut it away with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b. to line, g. and flay it from every part: and extend the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need that, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
And it is necessary to be cautious, lest a vein or nerve be cut.
And let the scalpel not be very sharp: lest it add to your work with the incision, or disturb the patient, and you cut what is not necessary.
But if you cut a vein, or an artery, or it prevents you from operating, then place on the wound crushed alum, or some powders which stanch blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess ceases, and the wound softens: or it begins and wishes to putrefy.
For the blood is stanched. Therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Then investigate with your index finger, if something remains of the small pustules; therefore incise them, and cleanse them.
But if there is in the root of the pustule a large vein: then it is necessary that you not incise that pustule from its root: indeed it is necessary that you tie it with strong doubled thread, and leave it until it falls by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old linen, which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment. Then take care of it.
If the entire pustule is incised, then it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound: and sew it immediately, after you see that completely no excess remains.
But if you see that excess remains because of the size of the pustule, then it is necessary that you intend to incise its root, and to extract it: and administer the suture which we have mentioned.
And which of the pustules contains moisture, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that the place of its maturity appears to you: and place the perforation from that which follows the lower part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer after the perforation a pledget with ointment, and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound already to be cleansed: then take care of it with an ointment generating flesh, until it heals.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess happening within the throat.
The ancients said this incision in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the writing of their speech.
But in those having quinsy, it is necessary that the incision of the epiglottis be avoided: since no help is done by it: because all the veins and the lung are weak.
In those, however, who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in the two tonsils, when there is no illness in the windpipe, it is necessary to use incision of the epiglottis, to escape from the loss which happens from suffocation.
Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should incise the epiglottis beneath three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across, in that which is between two circles, to the extent that the incision is in the fat, not in the cartilage: and indeed this place is suitable for incision, because it is free from flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
But if the physician is timid, then it is necessary that he extend the skin of the throat with a hook. Then let him divide the skin, until when he arrives at the windpipe: let him avoid a blood vessel, if he sees any of them.
Then let him cut the fat which we have described: and the incision of the windpipe is indicated by the phlegm which comes out of it, with that which is broken, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the hour in which suffocation is feared is removed, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis. The sum of this discourse which we have recounted is this:  unless they see that one of these abscesses has already obstructed the throat of the sick person, and the sick person is close to death and wishes his breathing to be cut, they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe through the wound and be saved from death.  And for this reason, they order the wound to be left open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed, and its malignancy is three days, or thereabouts. Then they order the wound to be sewn and to be treated until it is healed.
And that which I myself saw is that a maidservant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the windpipe.
And I was called to her treatment, and I found her groaning, like the groaning of the dying.
I uncovered the wound therefore, and found the blood which had flowed from the wound was little. Therefore I was confident that she had not cut a vein, nor the gullet; and wind was coming forth from the wound.
I cleansed therefore and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed; and nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to a better state.
Hence therefore I say: that in the incision of the epiglottis there is no fear.
Concerning the incision of a throat hernia.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, named a throat hernia, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body: and it is found much in women.
And it is according to two ways: for either it is natural: or it is accidental.
In the natural one certainly there is no pus.
Accidental, however, is according to two ways: of which one is similar to fatty nodes. And the other way, is similar to an abscess which is made from the knotting of an artery. And in it is fear, and it is not fitting that presumption be made to it with iron, except in that which is small: and you prove it, and investigate it with a probe. If therefore you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected with any veins: then cut it, as nodes are cut: and extract it with what it contains of a cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then explore the whole of it. Then treat the place with what is necessary of treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter XLV.
Concerning the incision upon kinds of nodes.
There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already mentioned all their kinds in the division: and it is necessary that I relate here the difference between a Node and an Exitura, since it causes doubt.
I say therefore, that when an Exitura is heat and fever and vehement pains, until the boiling over of superfluity is settled, and putrefaction is completed: then indeed fever and heat are quiet.
With a Node however there is not heat, nor fever, nor pains, and it contains them in a  kystis sifachin, which is its own sac, and is according to the color of the body: and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, and greater and smaller.
And they are according to two kinds: either fat: or they contain humidity. And the colors of humidity are many, according to what I said in the division.
It is necessary therefore, when you arrive at the cure of a Node, that you examine it, and investigate it first with an instrument which is called Intromissum, according to what its form will be in the chapter which is after this.
And the method of investigating abscesses, and all Nodes is, that you take this instrument, and introduce it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess: and you roll your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin. Then move your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider that which comes out in its track.
If therefore a running moisture comes out, whatever color it is: then cut it with a superficial incision, according to what I said in the other abscesses.
And if moisture does not come out in the track of the Intromissum, then know that it is thick: therefore cut it with an incision in the form of a cross, according to this form, as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and flay the skin from every part with ease: and keep the kistin if you can upon it, so that you extract it whole with the Node.
But if the kistis bursts during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this happens many times, then extract it piecemeal, until nothing of it remains.
For if a little or much of it remains, the Node returns all the more.
But if it overcomes you, and a little remains of it: then fill the wound at your completion with some sharp corrosive powders: and bind the wound, and place upon it what sits a warm abscess, and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Therefore if the Node is large, then sew its two lips, and treat it with that which causes incarnation.
But if you have a contrary vein, pulsating or not pulsating: then hurry, and fill the place with crushed zegi, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies, and the boiling of the blood ceases: then return to incising what remains of the Node.
Chapter XLVI.
Concerning the instruments for cutting and perforation.
Of these are the forms of the intromittents, and they are of three kinds.
For of them there is a large one, and of them there is a medium one, and of them there is a small one.
Let them be made of well-tempered iron, with square ends, so that they readily enter an abscess.
And these are the forms of the exploring instruments, and namely, the perforating ones: and one of them is named beris, that is, perforating; and they are of three kinds.
For of them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating by means of them abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes from what is between them of bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and soft, like large needles with which cushions are sewn, namely of bronze, or of brass, or iron, or silver.
And the better ones of them are those which are made of bronze.
And they are also made from black lead, which are suitable so that by means of them fistulas may be explored, whose cavities have curves, so that they may be explored with their softness along with those curves.
And again they are of three kinds. Because of them some are long, some medium, and some short, according to the size of the fistula and its stricture.
The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds.
Because some of them are simple, namely those which have one curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
And some of them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And some of them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and some of them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and skinned: and they are of three kinds: for there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Their ends which do the cutting are sharp, the other ends are not sharp: and they are not made thus, except so that with them help is given in skinning nodes for fear of cutting a vein, or a nerve: and so that the sick person may be healed by them, and find a little peace from the burning which he finds in the skinning of an abscess.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to a spatula with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end is a hidden spatula point: and in it runs inwards, and outwards when you wish, as you see.
The shape of the spatulas which are hidden between the fingers in the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Shapes of cupping instruments with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Let them be made of bronze or brass, round, somewhat long, as you see: and let them be thin.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping instruments be with you, large and small: so that you may cut off blood with them quickly when necessary, and then when medicine is not present to you.
However, do not use them in cutting off blood in every place of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the thighs of the leg, and the hip, and the thighs of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar to them, of fleshy, moist thighs.
And sometimes small instruments are made from them, similar to the husks of figs, according to their form: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this form.
Chapter XLVII.
Concerning the care of the breasts of men which are similar to the breasts of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are inflamed upon the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they are similar to the breasts of women: and they remain badly festering.
Therefore, whoever abhors that, it is necessary that he cut above the breasts with a lunate incision, according to this form from line b to line g. Then flay all the fat. Afterwards fill the wound with incarnative medicine. Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the nipple declines downwards, and softens because of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that it be incised on its two upper sides with two incisions similar to a lunar shape, each of which is joined with the other at the ends of each, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards flay the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about suture and powders, which is necessary for the treatment, until it is healed.
But if you do not complete the incision of what you ought to incise, because of the patient's restlessness, or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a pledget soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat. Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess which occurs under the armpit.
Chapter XLVIII.
Those abscesses which occur under the armpit are of the hard kinds of strumae, which contain cysts, and of those which contain humours.
Therefore those which contain humours ought to be incised with a lunate incision, according to this form, from line b. to line g.  When therefore all that is in the abscess of pus is evacuated, then fill it with old lint, and leave it until another day.
Then let the lint be removed, and let it be treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
But if the abscess is of the kind of nodes of strumae, then incise upon it, as we said in the section on strumae equally.
But if the wound extends so that it emits pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said in what precedes.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which happens because of an artery and vein.
When an artery is broken, and the skin which is above it is consolidated, then an abscess often happens from this; and similarly it happens to a vein also, so that an abscess and swelling happen in it.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are because of an artery and vein are: because, when the abscess is because of an artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking in it.
And that which is because of a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is a mistake, and especially that which is under the armpits, and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large. Therefore it is necessary that its treatment with iron be avoided, and that which of them also is in the extremities, or in the head, it is necessary that it be avoided.
Therefore, upon that which of them is from the swelling of the opening of the artery, make in the skin an incision lengthwise. Then open the incision with hooks, afterward the artery: and free it from the coats, until it is uncovered.
Then insert under it a needle, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
Then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula, until all the blood which is in it comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer treatment which generates pus, until the ligatures fall off: afterward treat it with ointments suitable for it, until it is healed.
But if there is an abscess because of a section of the vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much as you can of the abscess with the skin. Then insert a needle under the place which you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and let there be a double thread in it, until you extract it from the other side. Then tie the abscess with a good ligature: according to what I told you in the ligature of the grape, from two parts with two ends of thread.
But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the needle: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until when that which is in it comes out: then incise the superfluity of the skin, and leave that which is tied from it.
Then place on it a small cushion which you have submerged in wine and oil. Then administer the treatment, which is done with linen cloths and ointments, until it is healed.
Chapter L.
Concerning the abscess which happens from the twisting of the nerves.
Just as an abscess happens in the artery and vein, similarly an abscess happens in the nerves: which happens in them through percussion, or happens from excessive labor, and similar things: and it happens most in those places of the joints, or the heel, and in every place in which the joints are moved: and it is a serious abscess.
Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is squeezed with force, the infirm person feels in it something like numbness.
And it is not an abscess gathered deep in the body, rather it is under the skin, and it is moved to every part, and it does not go forward, or before, nor back to the posterior.
Therefore, what of them is in the joints, ought not to be invaded with iron. Perhaps contraction will happen.
But in that which of them is in the head, or in the forehead, cut the skin with a spatula. If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps, and cut it from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and flay it: then remove it, and close the wound with suture: and treat it, until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs in the abdomen.
There frequently occur to some men in their abdomens, and in the rest of their bodies,  thelil, which are called Fungals, because of their similarity to fungi.
Whose root is thin, and their head is thick, and their lips are inverted. And some of them are small; and some of them become very large.
And indeed I myself saw a man, and in his abdomen were two thelil, which were more like fungi than other things: they were white, with small roots, and their lips were inverted, and they were split, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
Therefore I cut them out, and found one weighed about eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces. And the procedure in cutting them out is that you should consider then, if the patient is moist, and the color of the thelil is white, moist, with a thin root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries in the fire at hand.
For often much blood is expelled during its excision; therefore, if the bleeding overcomes you, then cauterize it quickly.
But if you see the patient is fearful and timid of incision with iron, then take a suitably made lead thread, and tie the thelil with it: in the way we have described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the constriction of the lead. Therefore do not cease tightening the lead, as often as it presses on the thelil, until it is cut off, and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the thelil has a thick root, then there is something fearful and terrifying in its excision; especially that which is in the abdomen.
Nevertheless, it is possible to incise half of it. Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you presume to incise a thelil which is brown in color, of little sensation, and foul appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess; and I will come to the recollection of Cancer after this.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the treatment of an umbilical hernia.
An umbilical hernia arises from many causes. Or from fissures of the fascia which is over the abdomen; and from it protrudes fat or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures. Or from blood which flows from a vein or from an artery, as was stated before. Or from wind constricted there.
But if it is because of a fissure of the fascia and the protrusion of fat, then its color is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain; and it appears in various places. And if it is because of the protrusion of the intestine, then its location, with what we have narrated, is of greater variety. Therefore, when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it is greatly increased at the entrance of the bath, and vehement labor.
If however it is because of humidity, it is soft, then it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor constricted, nor increased.
But if it is because of blood, then with these signs, an abscess appears tending towards blackness.
But if it is because of  newly grown flesh: then it is a serious, large, hard abscess, and is fixed according to a single quantity.
But if it is because of wind, then its touch is soft.
And the operation in that is that you consider then if the prominence of the navel is because of the blood of an artery, or a vein, or wind: then you must be forbidden from its treatment. For in that there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter in which I discussed abscesses because of an artery and a vein.
But if the prominence of the navel is because of the intestine or a hernia, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath and stand erect. Then mark with a cautery around the entire navel. Afterwards instruct him to lie on his back between your hands. Then encircle with a broad spatula around the navel over the place you marked with the cautery. Then extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook. Then tie it around firmly with thread, or with a strong silk cord: and let the knot of the ligature be secure.
Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the ligature. If therefore you find it already seized by the ligature, then pull it out carefully, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine into the interior of the abdomen; and if you find a fistula, then seize it with a hook, and incise its excess.
But if an artery or vein is opposed to you, then surround it abundantly. Then return to your operation. And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the circumference which you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Then constrict the abscess in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place, until the extended flesh putrefies and falls away by itself; or incise it when it becomes thin and putrefies.
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments, until it is healed.
But if the protrusion of the navel is of raw flesh in it, or of moisture, then it is necessary that you hollow out the abscess, as we said. And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Then treat it with what solidifies the place.
Chapter 53.
Concerning the treatment of cancer.
We have already spoken in the division of the types of cancer, and how there is a way to its cure with medicines: and caution must be observed with its treatment with iron, so that it is not ulcerated: and we have spoken of cancer generated in the womb, and caution concerning its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible: such as cancer which is in the breasts, or in the hip, and similar ones, of the members located to extract all of it: especially when it is small and beginning.
However, when it is old and large, it is not fitting to approach it.
For I myself have not been able to heal anyone from it: nor have I seen another before me who has succeeded in it.
And the operation in it, when it is located as we have said, is that you precede, and relieve the patient from black bile several times. Then you bleed him if you find him with manifest repletion.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he is placed with the operation.
Then throw hooks suitable for it into the Cancer. Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it off quickly, but rather press the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instrument is possible there.
But if a flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped. Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter 54. Now we have narrated in the division the types of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs: and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only a type of ascites alone: and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympanites: nor in the case of hyposarca completely: for that is fatal.
When you have already treated this type of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your treatment has not helped: then consider. For if the patient has already suffered weakness, or there is another illness with him besides dropsy: such as if he has a cough, or diarrhea, and things similar to those: then beware of treating him with iron: because there is fear of that.
But if you see a patient of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone: and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is that you raise the standing patient between your hands, and a helper behind him presses his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the abdomen.
Then take a spiny spatula, according to this form. Let it be of two sharp parts, long, the sharp end like a spatula. However, let there be some shortness in it gradually, so that you do not pass through with it during the operation to the intestine, and injure it.
Then consider. For if the generation of dropsy is from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you lengthen with the incision from the navel the amount of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubic bone.
But if the generation of dropsy is due to illness of the liver: then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weak place.
Then perforate the whole skin with an instrument. Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with a spatula between the skin and the fat, as if you are flaying it: and let the amount that is flayed be the amount of a fingernail, or thereabouts.
Then perforate the fat, until the spatula reaches the empty place: and that is the place of the water. Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument, of which this is the form. And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: which at its lower part has a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other: and its end is incised, according to the manner of the incision of a reed, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a moderate quantity.
Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, in an hour perhaps the sick person dies through the dissolution of his animal spirit: or a syncope happens to him which approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the amount of his strength, and according to what the patient's conditions signify to you from the strength of his pulse, and from the goodness of it.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Which is, because it is immediately retained because of the skin which retains the opening which is over the sifac: of which I have spoken, that you should perforate it according to that method.
Then repeat the instrument on the following day, if you see the patient tolerate it: and also draw out a small quantity of water.
Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains of the water only a little.
But if you fear for the patient, and you leave behind a large amount of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and sun, and let him endure thirst: and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed: and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water: according to what I have recounted in what preceded.
Concerning the care of infants who are born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Chapter 55.
When any infant comes forth from the womb of its mother, and the orifice of its penis is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or not in its proper place.
Therefore it is necessary to aid it with its perforation immediately upon birth with a very fine spatula, according to this form.
Then place a fine nail of lead in the opening and bind it: and keep it for three or four days.
When therefore he wishes to urinate, let it be removed, and he will urinate. Then replace it.
And if you do not place lead, then it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.
But he whose opening is narrow, is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are injured. That is because, of those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis; wherefore he cannot urinate forwards, until he lifts his penis with his hand upwards. Nor is there generation for him, because the sperm cannot reach the womb in a straight line: and it is a very foul disease.
And the method of operation in this case is that the patient is laid on his back. Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with a strong extension, and incise the head of the penis from the place of the glans, with a sharp knife or a sharp spatula: just as is the incision of a reed, or as you shave something, so that its middle comes to resemble the head of the penis: and so that the opening falls in the middle as it ought.
And beware in your operation of a flow of blood. For that often happens. Therefore apply to it that which stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Concerning Albucasis, what happens in the foreskin and head of the penis, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter 56.
These things often happen to the penis, according to Albucasis, and there is a protrusion of foul flesh.
And of it, some is malignant, and some is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one you should suspend with a fine hook, and cut it away until you cleanse it entirely. Then place upon it lint soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterwards with diafinicon ointment, until it is healed.
But if the Albucasis is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary that you apply a cautery to it after its incision and shaving of it.
But if the Albucasis is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and part of the Albucasis is between the foreskin, and part of it outside: then it is necessary that you remove the Albucasis which is inside first, until when it consolidates, then treat the outside: because when you treat it together, the foreskin is not secured from being perforated.
And now blackness and corruption also happen in the testicles and foreskin. Therefore it is necessary that you hollow out all that which is already blackened, and that which wants to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Then spread over it afterwards with honey which is already mixed with the flour of pomegranate rinds, and of crushed and sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
But if a flow of blood happens, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For a cautery is helpful for two conditions at the same time, namely for a flow of blood, and a wound when it is corrupted.
But if the head of the penis is corroded, and the whole thing is destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary that you insert into the passage of the penis a small tube of lead, so that the sick man may urinate over it.
In the adhesion, however, of the foreskin with the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not happen except in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required on him: and sometimes adhesion happens because of a wound, or abscess: therefore it is necessary that you scrape it with a blunt spatula, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
But if it is difficult to separate them exquisitely, then it is necessary that you scrape something from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin. That is because when the foreskin is thin, perhaps it is perforated because of its thinness quickly.
Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine, until it is consolidated.
Chapter 57.
Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the cure of an error happening to them.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; nevertheless, since it is from our operation, our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation, and a lighter way leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
That is, because I have found the majority of surgeons and phlebotomists use cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors; and they use cautery, and binding with thread, and incision with a nail.
And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and I have found none better than cleansing with scissors and binding with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes. Because the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper skin is incised, and the lower layer remains; therefore it is forced to a further incision to cut the other, and future pain. And with cleansing which is done by cautery, that is, a finger-like instrument which sewers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not secured: because perhaps it enters into its hole.
In cleansing however with a hook, perhaps the iron escapes, and spoils your operation: and indeed a boy's skin is short in nature, and very often they are born such that they do not need cleansing: and I have already seen that.
But cleansing with scissors, and tying with thread, revealed a good experiment to me: because scissors are proportional in incision: therefore, because the sharpness which is above, is like the sharpness which is below. Therefore when you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation in one time: and a compression is made with a similar figure, containing the skin of the penis on every side, with which no mistake falls at all.
And the proper method of operation is, that you cause to be shown, a boy especially, if he is from those who understand a little, that you do not do, except that you tie a thread only on his penis: and you leave him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way that it is possible for you, from that which his intelligence receives. Then make him stand between your hands of prepared stature, and let him not be sitting: and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, lest the boy see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Then insert your hand to his penis, and inflate the skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the penis emerges. Then cleanse it from the filth that gathers in it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread. Afterwards tie a second ligature a little lower down. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature with a good grip, and incise between the two ligatures. Then raise the skin quickly upwards, and pull out the head of the rod. Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better) and put powder on top: and over the powder a cloth in which the yolk of a hard-boiled egg has been spread in rosewater, beaten with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on until the next day: and treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Now the shape of the forceps for cleaning is this.
Let the two ends be blunt, and let them meet: lest a nail-like projection escape from them: and let the length of the two sharpened parts be equal to the length of the two handles.
The error which occurs in cleaning is: because perhaps the whole inner skin, or part of it, escapes at the incision.
Therefore it is necessary that you extend it with your nail before suppuration of the place: and incise it evenly.
But if you cannot hold it with your nail, then draw it out with a hook, and incise it.
But if three days pass, and what is under the rod remains inflated, suppurated: then leave it until the warm abscess settles, and flay it easily, and incise it as it is prepared for you: and beware of the head of the rod. For that will not harm it.
Therefore treat it with that which consolidates the wound from the powders, which we have recounted in the treatise on powders: and if it is incised from the skin beyond measure, and extends to the higher parts, that also does not harm it.
Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Concerning the extraction of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growth of flesh, and similar things from those which we have spoken of in the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not discharged, and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is now in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that the patient be bent over on his knees. Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the patient hold his breath as much as possible for him. The neck of the bladder is therefore forced towards the expulsion of the stone to the rear: wherefore the urine is discharged.
But if it is not discharged with what we have said, and the matter is severe for the patient: then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave like the quill of a bird's feather in the slenderness of a ray, long in the likeness of one and a half palms: to which there is a slender tube in its head.
And the method of the urine's exit through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie wool or cotton to its end with a good ligature: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with scissors if anything of the wool is superfluous, but introduce it into the tube forcefully, like an elevator.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white: and make the patient sit upon a seat, and moisten the bladder and its neck with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then introduce the syringe into the neck easily, until it reaches the root of the neck.
Then bend it upwards from the part of the navel.
Then push the syringe inside it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has already reached the empty thing: and this is not done in this order, except because the passage, in which it goes, is one in which there is tortuosity.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually. For the urine will follow the wool.
Then withdraw it, and make the urine run through the urinary passage: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease doing that, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a Clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is constricted in it, and it is necessary to instill waters and medicines into it: then let it be done with an instrument which is called a Clepsydra, and this is its form.
For it is deaf, that is, closed. And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see.
And the concave place, in which is that which impels, should be according to the quantity which fills it without addition, until when something is drawn with it, the moisture is drawn: and when it is impelled, it is expelled with it to a distance: according to what the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in the battles of Mars.
Therefore, when you wish to project moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw with that which impels to the upper parts, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Then insert its end into the tube, as we have described in the syringe. Then impel the moisture with that which impels it; for that moisture arrives at the bladder immediately, so that the infirm person feels it.
The shape of a slender clyster by which the bladder is clysterized.
Let it be made of silver or brass: its head should be taller, similar to a small cup, and below it a sinus into which a ligature falls.
Then take a ram's bladder and put into it the moisture with which you wish to clysterize the bladder. Then tie it between the two sinuses with a strong ligature using doubled thread, and warm that moisture a little over the fire.
Then insert the end of the clyster into the rod, afterwards squeeze your hand over the bladder with the moisture with a suitable constriction, until the patient feels that the moisture has now reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it throughout its circumference. Then insert strong thread into those holes, as they are rolled. Then gather the circle, as an *alsofratu* is gathered; after you have placed in it what you wish of moist things, oils and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument: and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Concerning the extraction of a stone.
We have already spoken in the division of the kinds of stone, and its cure with medicines; and I have spoken of the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and bladder, and the signs of all this; and I have spoken of the stone in which operation with the hand and incision falls; and it is a stone generated in the bladder properly; and that which is fixed in the urethra; and I am narrating this with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that a stone generated in the bladder happens most often to boys.
And among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its thinness; and white sand appears in it, and the sick person rubs his penis, and labors with it, and often it hangs down. Then it is raised, and the anus comes out with it in many of them.
And the healing of children is easy, until they reach fourteen years. And it is difficult in old men. In young men, however, it is moderate, in that which is between that; and whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if small, the care of it is the opposite.
Therefore, when we arrive at the cure, it is necessary first that we cleanse the patient with a clyster, which draws out all the excrement which is in his intestines; for it sometimes prevents the finding of the stone on examination.
Then let the patient be received with his feet, and shaken, and moved downwards: that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or rise from a high place sometimes.
Then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands shall be under his hips, so that the whole bladder may slope downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel the stone in the space, then hasten immediately with the incision upon it.
But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the patient is a boy: or the middle finger if he is a grown young man: and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and impel it outwards towards the place, of which you wish the incision: and order the assistant, that he press the bladder with his hand, and order another assistant, that he extend the testicles with his right hand upwards: and with his other hand, that he remove the skin, which is under the testicles in the part from the place where is the incision.
Then insert the cutting spatula, whose form is this. And cut in that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left buttock: and let the incision be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision be wide outwardly, and narrow inwardly, according to the quantity that the exit of the stone from it may not be greater.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
And know, that of a stone there are angles and edges, wherefore its exit is made difficult on account of that.
And of it is a smooth one, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is made easy.
To that therefore which has angles and edges, add to the fissure.
If therefore it does not exit thus, then it is necessary that you devise upon it: or that you bind upon it with a bandage decently, whose extremity is like a moon, which binds upon the stone, and does not slip away from it: or that you insert under it a subtle instrument, of curved extremity.
But if you cannot upon it, then enlarge the hole a little. But if something of blood overcomes you, cut it off with a scalpel.
But if the stone is more than one, then push in first the largest to the opening of the bladder. Then incise upon it. Afterwards push the small one after it: and similarly do if there are more than two.
But if it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut upon it with a large incision. Because one of two things happens to the patient, either that he dies, or there happens to him a constant dripping of urine; because of this, because the place does not completely consolidate.
Truly administer its expulsion, until it comes out; or work on its fracture with forceps, until you extract it piecemeal.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: so that the hot abscess may be settled.
Then lay the patient on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day. When therefore you have loosened it, moisten the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs in the wound, and corrosions, and things like that: as if blood is congealed in the bladder, and urine is prevented from it: and this is known from the passing of blood with urine. Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and draw out that blood. For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply to every kind with that which is suitable from the treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the hours of the entire treatment, that you bind the two hips, and bring them together, because of the medicines which are placed on the place.
But if the stone is small, and is in the passage of the penis, and is fixed in it, and the exit of urine is prevented: then treat it with what I relate before you arrive at incision. For many times you will be excused from incision by this treatment, for I have already proven it.
And it is so that you take a perforator of iron, whose form is this, of a triangular point, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie with it the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the perforating iron into the penis easily, until the perforator arrives at the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand in the stone gradually: and attempt its perforation, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
For the urine is immediately discharged.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the penis. For it is broken, and comes out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures. Then extract it. Afterwards loosen the ligature, and clean the congealed blood which is in the wound.
And the ligature of the thread under the stone is not necessary, except so that it does not return to the bladder: and the other ligature above, except so that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound: and for that it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread, that you raise the skin upwards, so that it returns at your completion, and covers the wound, as we said.
Chapter 61.
Concerning the extraction of a woman's stone.
A stone is rarely produced in women.
But if a stone should happen to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is prohibited because of many methods.
One of them is that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
And a second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or among those having husbands.
A third is, because you do not find a woman well-skilled in this art, especially in operating with the hand.
And a fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that there is fear.
But if necessity compels to that, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-skilled: and few are found.
But if you deprive her of that, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a well-taught midwife in women's matters, or a woman who understands some part of this art: therefore make her present, and especially to her, that she may do all that you order her from the examination concerning the stone.
First, what is it, that she may look if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
If therefore she finds it, she constricts it under her finger, and then order the midwife to insert her finger into the vulva of the sick woman, and inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand upon the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression.
If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder to the lower parts with the greatest of her strength, until she arrives with it at the root of the hip.
Then she cuts upon it at the meeting of the middle of the vulva at the root of the hip, from whichever part it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger is not removed from the stone, constricting under it: and let the incision be small at first. Then she inserts a probe upon that incision.
Then she inserts a probe upon that incision. If therefore she feels the stone, then she adds to the incision according to a proportionate amount so that the stone exits from it.
And know that the kinds of stones are many. For among these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Know therefore its kinds, so that it may be signified to you by this concerning that which you wish.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in the place pounded alum, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is stopped.
Then return to your operation, until the stone comes out: and do so that you prepare with you from the instruments, which I spoke of in the extraction of the stone in men, that you may be aided by them in your operation.
But if a flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which has been cut: then place powder on the place, and bind it with a suitable bandage: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it. Perhaps for the weak woman will die. Then take care of the wound.
Therefore when the sharpness of the blood is settled after days, and the place is putrefied, then return to your operation, until the stone comes out.
Chapter LXII.
Concerning the incision for watery hernia.
Watery hernia is nothing but a collection of moisture in the white fascia, which is under the skin containing the testicle: and it is called fascia.
And sometimes it is in its own tunic, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the egg, until it is corrupted: which is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the white fascia, which we have mentioned: and this does not happen except rarely.
And indeed the generation of this hernia is from weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out to them. And sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For either its color inclines to yellow, or it is red like blood, or foul, black, or it is white and watery, and this is what is most common.
And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these. For if it is in the white tunica albuginea which we have spoken of, then the abscess is round, somewhat elongated like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
And if the moisture is in its proper tunic, then the abscess is round with a part of an egg, and because of this a man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white tunica albuginea, then it falls under the sense.
When therefore you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, whose form has preceded. According to that therefore which comes out in the track of the inserted instrument, judge concerning that which is between it.
When therefore we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you order the patient, that he be bled if it is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then let him be laid on his back on something a little high, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit you on his left, and order the assistant, that he sit on his right, who should extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the mirach of the belly.
Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle lengthwise, up to near the comb: and let the incision be made according to the straightness of a line equidistant which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac which contains it: and flay it and observe, or beware of this, that you cut it: and let your flaying, with which you flay it, be from the part which hangs with the egg more: and subtly search with the flaying according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then pierce the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water.
Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles containing it: and incise the sifac however it is possible for you to incise it, either with its totality, or piecemeal, especially its thin side. For if you do not exquisitely search, in its incision there is no security, lest the water return.
But if the egg proceeds outwardly from its skin at the time of your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the sifac, reduce it. Then bring together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Then care for it like the other wounds, until it is healed.
But if you find the egg corrupted by blackness or something else, then it is necessary that you ligate the vessels which are the suspensory, fearing a flow of blood.
Then cut away the testicle with the suspensory, and extract the egg; afterwards care for it with what we have said.
If however water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part in the same way as you did the other equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that there is one operation, then do it: then wipe away the blood. And insert into the incisions wool submerged in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside another wool which you have submerged in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the scrotum: and place on top folded cloths, which are compresses: and bind them on top with a bandage, which is six fingers wide in this manner.
Then two cloths are taken, and sewn, and filled with carded wool, according to this likeness: and let the ends be made which are pressed with tow, or moist wool: and let them be gathered with a bandage in the lumbar region of the breeches: and one end should reach over the anus to the back, and the second should reach to the pubic region: and two ends below over the two hips, and two other ends over the two groins, and let the whole bandage be gathered in the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this branch is treated artificially with a cautery in place of an incision with iron: and it is, that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have related: until when white pus containing water is discovered: then take a cautery, according to this form.
It is similar to a Greek letter.
Then perforate that pus with it, and it is heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Then extend the pus with hooks, and scrape it with a thin, heated cautery, and incise it as much as is possible for you, until you eradicate all of it.
And beware of the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
If however a hot abscess, or blood flow, or something else opposes you during the time of incision, or during the time of cautery, then it is necessary that you treat that which opposes you from it with the treatment which is suitable for it, according to what has been stated before.
But if the patient is timid, and does not await this operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I relate it: and it is.
When it is confirmed to you by what we have said about the signs, that the swelling is watery, then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a broad spatula; and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place a pledget over the place, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water may run out; then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is opposition to the outflow of water at the time when you perforate it, and this is only because a white membrane opposes the opening of the wound and prevents the exit of the water, then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of the dropsical is drawn out, the form of which has preceded; or add a little to the operation of the wound.
And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or thereabouts. When therefore it collects, then let it be perforated in the same way, and the sick person will pass his days.
Chapter LXIII.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy fistulas.
Know that in the incision upon this fistula, there is fear leading to destruction in many conditions. Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal is to be saved from it.
And I am recalling the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Therefore I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are formed: and this happens from many causes, namely.
Either from an excess of something sharp or acrid, which is poured out to the testicles. Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
And sometimes it happens from a knotting and swelling of the arteries, as its mention has already preceded: or from a swelling of the veins.
Therefore, that which is from them from the swelling of the arteries, is known by the disposition of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers. And it is not necessary that you touch it completely.
That however which happens from the swelling of the veins, nothing is dispersed from it upon compression with the fingers.
And now it is possible that a section is made upon this kind and upon the remaining flesh: and it is, that you cut the skin of the testicles. Then extend the egg upwards, and extract it with the white sifach: and free the suspensory ligament from the vessels, and ligate the vessels: and incise the suspensory ligament after you free it from every part of the parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born [or, newly formed]  fleshes, then it is necessary that you draw out the egg, and incise it.
And if adhesion is between something of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion, and incise it with a round incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary that you incise all of it, and extract the egg, as we said.
When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter LXIIII.
Concerning the treatment of the ramic, which is with a vine.
A vine is a swelling enveloped in a certain wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles: and it makes movement and exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, there is fear, because of that which preceded its remembrance.
Truly it is necessary that we speak of the operation on it according to what the first ones did.
Therefore I say that it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat. Then push the suspensory of the testicles downwards. Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the vessels which are near the penis: and let another assistant hold them, and extend them with strong extension.
Then incise with a broad, sharp spatula, a transverse section in the direction of the vessels, until the vessels are revealed.
Then flay from every part, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Afterwards, insert a needle with double thread into them, and tie it in the first places where the veins meet: and tie it again in the last of them. Then cut them in the middle with a straight section according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from the foul, corrupt humors.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of the other wounds, in which the power to generate pus is present, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle fall away. For there is no harm through that.
But if a vein affects all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed with the vessels: lest the egg be deprived of nourishment, because of the incision, and waste away, or dry up, and there be no help with them.
Chapter 65.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal fistulas.
The outcome of this fistula is from a section which happens in the sifach extended over the abdomen in the groin region from the mirach of the belly.
Therefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles. And this rupture is either from the sifach, or its extension.
And these two types happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy thing, and similar things.
And a sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach. It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an equal abscess towards the deep; therefore, because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And its sign when it is from the section of the sifach, because it causes a vehement pain to happen from its beginning suddenly: and it is a diverse abscess, appearing under the nearby skin: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
And sometimes it exits with the intestine zirbum: and this is named intestinal Ramex, and zirbia: and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
And sometimes dung runs into the intestine, and is retained there: and with it is the destruction of the infirm; because it causes a bad pain to happen, and especially when it is pressed.
And in the cure of the species of this illness with iron there is fear: wherefore it is necessary that the case be avoided in it.
And the method of operation is, that you order the infirm, that he reduce the intestine with his hand to the interior of his cavity, if it obeys return. Then he will be laid supine upon his neck between your hands: and raise his legs.
Then extend the skin which follows the skin to the upper parts, and cut the whole skin of the testicles lengthwise. Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and let the incision be of such a size, that, if possible, the egg may come out of it.
Then flay the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white siphak is uncovered, hard on every side: then introduce your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and absolutely loosen with it the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the egg.
Then move with the right hand to the interior the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white siphak upwards, with the left hand: and raise the egg with the siphak to the part of the incision: and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards: and you loosen the adhesion which is behind with the solution completed.
And search with your fingers, so that there may be nothing there of the intestine involved in the hard white siphak. But if you find something of it, then push it down to the belly.
Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads: and introduce it near the last siphak, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads. Then arrange some of them over some with a figure which is in the manner of a cross: and tie with them the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until it cannot send anything to them from some of the vessels which nourish them: so that a hot abscess may not happen thence. And place another ligature again outside the first ligature, less than two fingers distant from it. And after these two ligatures leave from the siphak, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger: and cut away all the rest according to the roundness, and remove the testicle from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles an incision, from which blood and pus flows: as we have related in what has gone before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound: and apply the ligature which we have described. And sometimes the white siphak which we have mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing the flow of blood. For this often happens. And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be moistened with warm water: and place on it that which we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Concerning a suction cup.
In this suction cup I have not seen anyone who dared to operate on it with iron.
And the first indeed said that it is done as we have narrated in the suction cup which is with a vine. That is, to tie the vessels after the incision upon it with ease below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with that which opens it, until the vessels fall away; and treat the wound, according to what we have said, until it heals.
Chapter 67.
Concerning the rupture which occurs in the groins.
When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it descends, it is a little, and returns at all hours: truly if time is prolonged with it, a fissure is added in the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
And this happens from the extension of the sifach, which is in the groins, as we have said. That is, because the sifach is extended: then it softens, and the place suppurates, and protrudes.
And its cure is with cautery, as its account preceded.
And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method: and it is, that the sick man lies on his back between your hands. Then cut the place of the rupture of the abscesses and the protruding part, with a cut across, to the amount of three fingers.
Then constrict the alsifak and what are under the skin, until when the white sifach is uncovered, which is under the skin that follows it.
Then take a ray, and place it on the protruding part of the sifach, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew two protruding places on the end of the ray from the sifach, and connect one of them with the other with a suture; then withdraw the end of the ray.
And do not cut the alsifach completely, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I made you know in the treatment of intestinal fistula.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds. Therefore, when you cut the threads, clean it, and restore the wound until it heals.
For the sisach is contracted, and no prominence is added to the rupture.
And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to healing.
Chapter LXVIII.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, on account of which the flesh which is between them is softened, and its appearance is made foul.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked in its treatment, that he make the sick man lie on his back, and that he incise all the skin which is softened upon the natural skin.
Then he shall bring together the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, sew first the superfluity of the softened skin with three sutures, or four, and make the suture firm.
Then incise between the sutures.
Then treat with the treatment of the other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69.
Concerning castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law: and because of that it would be permitted to me not to mention it in this my book: and its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when he is questioned about it: and that he should know the treatment of him to whom it happens.
And the other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, he-goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Therefore I say that castration is done in two ways. Or by attrition. Or by fissure and incision.
Now in that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to the touch.
But in castration by fissure and incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the suspensory ligament and cut above each testicle with one incision, until when the two testicles come forth: then incise them after you have skinned each one, and do not leave on them of the *sifak* anything except the fine *sifak* which is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires coitus.
Then take care of the wound until it heals.
Chapter LXX.
Concerning the care of a hermaphrodite in two ways.
A hermaphrodite from men is according to two ways. One of them is because there appears in him that which follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a figure like the vulva of a woman, in which there is hair; and sometimes urine flows from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is one kind, and it is the vulva of a woman above the pubis like very small male testicles, protruding outwardly: of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of the three kinds, two from men, and one kind from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut away the added flesh, until the impression of them disappears. Then treat them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second kind of men, however, from which urine comes out, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
Chapter LXXI.
Concerning the incision of the frenulum, and of the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
The frenulum is perhaps added to the natural thing, until it is deformed and its appearance becomes foul; and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it is spread out like in men, and reaches even to coitus.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold the excess of the frenulum with the hand, or with a hook, and incise it: and do not go too far in the incision, especially in the depth of the root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
Flesh, moreover, which arises, is flesh which is born in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it protrudes outwardly in the likeness of a tail; and on account of this some first call the ailment tailed. Therefore it is necessary that we incise it just as we incise the frenulum, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of the imperforate vulva of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, as it were, the imperforate vulva of a woman, or it is a small opening. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from a preceding illness; and indeed this happens either from added, naturally occurring flesh, or from a thin membrane, or a thick one; and it occurs either deep within the womb, or at its sides, or in its upper or lower part; and it prevents intercourse and conception and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
And its recognition is made by the midwife's examination, if the obstruction is apparently near.
But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is from a thin membrane, and is near the two labia: then hurry, and break it.
And it is [necessary] that you place little pillows on the two labia.
Then place the index fingers of your two hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread. Then spread the two labia forcefully until the thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the area: and let the woman cohabit every day, so that the area does not heal in another way.
But if the membrane is thick, then it is necessary that you cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is of a fleshy nature, then suspend it with hooks and incise it: and have with you medicines which staunch the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead tube, so that the wound does not close quickly, keep it in place for several days: and administer a pledget of dry linen, then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
And sometimes the birth of other flesh occurs in the womb: therefore it is necessary that they be incised in this manner: provided it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess which is in the womb, should never be treated with iron.
Chapter LXXIII.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red Bothor in the vulvas of women.
Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the orifices of the veins, until much blood flows from them constantly.
When therefore hemorrhoids become old, they become athelil: and I have already spoken in the division of their species, and their signs: and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
I say therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses: then there is no treatment for it with iron.
But those of them which are in the orifice of the womb upon which the sense falls, are those which are cured.
It is necessary therefore that you introduce the woman into a cold house. Then extend the hemorrhoids with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise them from their roots.
Then pulverize over them at the flow of blood from one of the incisive powders without biting: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar to them.
Then let him push her feet against the wall for one hour. Afterwards, place her in cold water.
But if the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it over her back.
If therefore blood is cut off with it, it is good: and if not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts, without scarification.
Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tarthith, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the branches of alaulat, that is, aglanter, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the place.
When therefore the abscess is quiet, then treat the place with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth however is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of rough appearance.
Therefore it is necessary that you incise what appears of it, according to what I said in thelil equally: and treat it until it heals.
Chapter LXXIIII.
Concerning the perforation of the exit which happens in the womb.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and a stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
And indeed I have already described all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the division: it is necessary that I describe in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the womb, when it is of the abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is done with iron.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider. Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it redden: if sensation falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with that which aids in maturation, until when the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat which surpasses two seats, and she will recline, or be laid on her back, and draw her feet to the lower part of her belly: and let her hips be spread, and let her place her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable ligature to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the orifice of the womb is opened.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix it with a probe to the depth of the woman's womb: so that that which enters from the instrument is no more than the depth of the womb, and harms the weak woman.
But if the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary that you place pledgets on the covering of the depth of the womb: so that the entrance of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb may be prevented: and it is necessary that he place the handle, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that he hold the instrument, and that the attendant rotate the handle, until the depth of the womb is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by hand, and is smooth and soft: then it is necessary that you cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a pledget submerged in rose oil: or green oil, in which there is some stypticity: and place the pledget, and extract the section in the depth of the womb.
And place externally over the womb, and over the vulva, clean wool submerged in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then let it be treated after two days with the ointment which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is clysterized with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily, or long birthwort, has been boiled: then it returns to the ointment.
But if the wound is hidden internally in the womb, then it is necessary that you abstain from its treatment with iron, nay, treat it with what we have said in the division.
Chapter 77.
The teaching of obstetricians, how live embryos, having emerged according to a non-natural form, are to be treated.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to know first the form of a natural birth.
Therefore, among its signs is that when you see a woman being compressed downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and that which is upon her of the birth is lightened, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is head first, and the afterbirth with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
For when it descends head first, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed from those superfluities with a good cleansing.
But that which is besides this birth, is unnatural, and not praiseworthy.
Because sometimes the fetus exits on its feet, and its body exits before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and its hands exit: or its belly exits: and perhaps it is turned over on its neck, and similar things from unpraiseworthy forms.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, skillful in all these things, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form of them, and what its nature is, and is signified by it, and is relied upon.
When the fetus exits head first in its natural exit, and it becomes strenuous for the woman, and the birth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her: and vaporize her vulva with a decoction of fenugreek, and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and let her break the secundine with it, and cut it with her nail, until that which is in it of moisture flows out: and press the woman's belly, until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman must be given a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then instruct her after the clyster, that she be compressed: and make her sneeze with conserve, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour. For the fetus will exit immediately.
But if two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary to gently replace them little by little. But if it does not obey on entry, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upward; then shake the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall from the shaking.
Therefore if the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then incise them, and extract the remainder of the fetus: and bind its hand with a cloth, and draw it out evenly: for thus it will come out.
The exit of the embryo on its feet. When the fetus exits on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then gradually turn the fetus; afterwards straighten it.
Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
When therefore they come out as far as the hips, then instruct her to be compressed, and make her sneeze with snuff: for it will come out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out with what we have related, then gradually return the fetus until you place it according to its natural form. For then it will come out with an easy exit.
But if it is prevented with all that we have related: then take some marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and beat the whole in a mortar with a good beating: then anoint with it the vulva of the woman, and the lower part of her belly. Then make her sit in warm water until it reaches her hypochondria.
Therefore, when you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her a pessary of myrrh: and apply it. When therefore the pessary has remained for one hour, then make her sit on a seat. Then make her sneeze: and compress her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with gentle pressure. For the fetus will come out immediately.
The exit of the fetus is over the knees and hands. When it comes out in this manner, then she will succeed in gradually inserting her hands. Then the woman will be laid on her neck, and her feet will hang downwards: and she will lie on the bed, and clasp her hands. Then press on her belly gradually. Then remove what is under her feet from the cushions, until she is prepared in the lower part. But if the fetus does not come out, then take its feet and move them with a strong movement. Then press what is above the hypochondria gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts. Then let him insert his hands and equalize the fetus gradually: and instruct the woman to be compressed, until the fetus comes out.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands. Let his hand be used in the reduction. But if he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
But if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her legs with a strong shaking.
Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.
But if labor takes her, then make her sit on a seat. Then strive to reduce the hand, and adjust the fetus according to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to strain herself until it comes out.
The exit of the fetus is over its neck, with its hands outstretched, and its face is towards its mother's back. The midwife ought to hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it, and adjust it easily.
Therefore, when it is adjusted, then place on her vulva that which we have described of oil and mucilages.
Then instruct her to move gradually. When therefore you have done that, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to lean to her right side. Then instruct her to be compressed; and make her sneeze with a sternutatory.
The exit of the prepared fetus on the side. When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then tear the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it may not be retained, and die.
Then push the fetus inwards, until you place it as is necessary; and instruct the woman to compress herself several times: for it itself will exit with an easy exit.
The exit of twins, or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four are born. However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Five, however, is unnatural, and they do not fully live: and a single afterbirth contains them, however many there are: and they are separated by the sifach, distinguishing between them, connected at the umbilicus of each of them.
And sometimes they come out as a single fetus does, by a natural, easy exit; and they come out by a laudable exit, as we have narrated.
But if some of them are difficult at birth, and they arrive at what we have described from unnatural forms, then treat them as we have narrated: and let the midwife be skillful, and let her do what she does with skill and gentleness, and let her adapt to every form with what is prepared for her by skill leading to health.
Concerning that which is formed in the womb from embryos, and is aborted.
Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has been verified by me, that a woman aborting emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore all this ought to be in the knowledge of midwives. For perhaps a similar thing will come to her: therefore let her oppose it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I mentioned in the division concerning medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with the hand, then it is necessary that you consider.
Therefore if the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted with any of the accidents from which loss is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid supine upon the bed, upon her back, and her head be inclined lower, and her legs raised: and a servant should hold her from both sides, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body is not drawn out during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mallow mucilage, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages: then let her introduce it into the womb with ease. Then let her seek with it the place in which to fix hooks on the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its clavicle, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubis, and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand: and introduce it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in some of those places which we have mentioned, until she arrives at the empty thing.
Then let her fix in opposition to it another hook, or a third, if she needs: so that the traction is equal, and does not incline to one side.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not be according to straightness only, but rather let it be moved to every part, so that its exit is eased: just as is done with a tooth at its extraction.
And it is necessary that that which is between them be softened, so that the extension is easier. But if a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with oil, and introduce them from the side, so that she may roll out with them that which is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then let the hooks be moved to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
If therefore a hand comes out before other things, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it. Then pull it out until, when it comes out completely, you incise it either at the joint of the sole or at the elbow; and thus you must do in the other hand and in the two feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or a constriction happens to it in its exit, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary that she insert a thorny spatula between the fingers, and split the head with it, and extract the water; or break it with the instrument which is called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is after this.
Similarly, if the fetus is by nature large-headed, then it is necessary that you cut the algengematu; or extract it with the misdach, as we said. Then pull out the bones with forceps.
But if the head comes out and is constricted at the clavicle, then let it be split until the moisture which is in the chest is poured out.
But if it is not entangled, nor yields to exit, then incise the head piecemeal, according to what is possible for you.
But if there is an abscess in the lower part of the belly, or dropsy is in it, then it is necessary that you perforate it until the moisture runs out of it.
If however the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is light.
But if it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and split the belly or chest until that which is in them runs out.
But if the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns, then let the midwife insert her left hand. Therefore if the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert her hand into the depth of the womb, and search with it for the head, and draw it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb; then let her insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and draw it with them.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, because of a hot abscess which has happened to it, then it is not necessary that labor should be undertaken on it; rather it is necessary then to administer the effusion of moist, oily things, and apply plasters, and to sit in waters which soften and moisten.
But if the fetus is on its side, then it is possible that it may be straightened; then let that which we said concerning a living fetus be administered.
But if that is not possible, then let it be cut piecemeal, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you not leave anything at all of the afterbirth inside.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then administer what we said concerning hot abscesses which occur in the womb.
But if a flow of blood occurs, then let it descend into styptic waters, and administer the remaining cure.
And I indeed already saw a woman, in whose belly a fetus had died; then she was impregnated above it a second time, afterward another fetus also died. Therefore, after a long time an abscess happened to her in her navel, and it swelled until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Therefore I was called to her cure, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound was not consolidated.
Therefore I placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction: and a bone came out from the place. Then several days passed for her, and another bone came out. Therefore I wondered at this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Therefore I investigated the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition: and she now lived thus for a long time, and discharged a little pus from the place.
And I did not establish this extraneous matter here, except because there is knowledge in it, and help for that which a skillful physician administers with the hand in treatment.
Chapter LXXVII.
Concerning the forms of instruments necessary in the extraction of a fetus.
The form of the pivot by which the matrix is opened.
Here below is the form of a constrictor, by which books are bound, which equally has two pivots at the two ends of two pieces of wood. However, this pivot ought to be more slender than the constrictor; and it should be made either of ebony or boxwood.
And let the width of each piece of wood be about two fingers; and the edge of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are now fixed to both, whose length is half a palm more or less; and the width of each is about two fingers, or more or less.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two pivots.
Another form similar to that one, more slender and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each addition is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Therefore when you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on the bed, with her legs hanging down, open what is between her legs. Then insert these two joined additions into the matrix: and you are holding the lower extremity of the instrument between her hips. Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount you wish of the opening of the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
The form of another Vertigo which the ancients called the Impelling Form by which the fetus is impelled.
The form of the Almisdac, by which a large head is crushed: and it is similar to forceps, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
And sometimes it is oblong, like forceps according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like saw teeth, with which it is cut and crushed.
The form of a hook having one point.
The form of a hook having two points.
The form of a spatula having two ends for cutting off the head.
The form of two broad spatulas also.
All these instruments are practiced, and the more their types are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker he is at his work, and the more highly regarded among men, because of their quantity.
Therefore do not despise any of these instruments, but let them be prepared for you. For their necessity is inexcusable.
Chapter LXXVIII.
Concerning the extraction of the secundines.
When the secundines are retained after childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the woman to hold her breath. Then make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils. If therefore it comes out by this, it is good.
If not: then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid; and put into it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamus, rue, and dill, and chamomile, and seseli, and cassia lignea, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and put them over the fire.
Then place a reed tube over the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we said. For the afterbirth will come out easily.
But if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage. Then let her insert it into the vulva, and search for the afterbirth with it. When therefore she has found it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
But if it is attached deep in the womb, then let her insert her hand, as we have described, until when she finds the afterbirth, and pull it out gradually according to the straightness, so that the womb does not fall during forceful traction: rather it is necessary that it be moved easily to the right and left sides: then let the amount of traction be increased. For then it obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with medication from a pot with herbs.
But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then beware lest you tire yourself in repeated extraction.
Truly it is necessary that what comes out to the mouth of the womb from it, be tied to the woman's hip. Then give her a clyster with tetrapharmacon ointment. For it will putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve, and it will come out.
However, when it putrefies, a bad odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak woman. Therefore, suitable fumigations ought to be administered to it.
Some of the ancients, however, have already tested the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated for the retention of the secundines and menses.
Let it be made of glass similar to an alembic, or of brass: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed upon the coals: let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another.
Chapter LXXIX.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus.
Many boys are born, and their anuses are imperforate, which a subtle membrane has already obstructed. Therefore, it is necessary that the midwife perforate that membrane with her finger: and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp spatula: and let her beware of the muscle, lest she touch it.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil upon it. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wants to defecate.
And now there occurs an obstruction of the anus also from the healing of a wound, or an abscess. Therefore it is necessary that that consolidation be cut, then treated with what we have said of treatment and lead.
Chapter Eighty.
Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Fistulas which occur in the lower part, are a knotting, and a swelling which occur near the anus externally: or in the space of one part: and it is one fistula, or several.
When therefore that knotting becomes old, it is opened, and a watery white moisture, or thin pus, flows from it.
And sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating. Therefore penetrating ones are known by that which comes out with the excretion and flatulence, when the sick person uses excretion: and perhaps worms come out of them.
And some of these fistulas, when they are penetrating, extend to the bladder, and to the urinary passage. And some of them penetrate to the hip joint and to the coccyx.
However, what distinguishes a fistula penetrating to the anus from one that does not is that you insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe into the fistula, made of air or iron, when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
But if you do not feel it completely, nor does anything like excretion, flatulence, or a worm, as I said, come forth from the opening, then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hasten to its cure.
And when a fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary meatus, then its indication is the exit of urine from it, and the prevention of its consolidation in this place with medicines.
If however it penetrates to the hip joint or to the hip bone, then its sign is that a probe reaches there, if there is no tortuosity in it to the bone, and the discovery of pain around the part, and that pus always comes forth from it, and that medication does not work in it, nor does it consolidate with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their cure is labor and vanity for that foolish physician upon whom it is inflicted.
However, in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I relate to you, and I have already proved it: and it is so that the patient lies between your hands on his back, and you raise his legs above his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his belly. Then insert a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
But if the patient feels it around the anus, then you ought to insert your index finger into the anus.
Therefore if you feel the probe has already penetrated by itself, detected by your finger, beyond what you feel between your finger and the fistula itself or the flesh: then you know for certain that it is penetrating: therefore you do not labor over it, since there is no cure for it, as we have said.
However, they have said that in some men the flesh heals, and of the medication by which help is hoped for it, is to heat a fine cautery according to the size of the fistula, as preceded, and to insert it burning into the fistula until it reaches around the anus. Then repeat this twice or thrice, until you know that all those added and filtered flesh-like tissues, which are similar to a bird's quill, have been cauterized.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, until those cauterized tissues come out; then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate flesh.
If therefore it heals, it is good.
And if not, then it never heals with any other treatment.
And if a probe emerges and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick covering of flesh or fat between it and the probe, and you see a fistula in what follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the probe which is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the end of the probe reaches, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered tissues, which resemble the quill of a bird's feather, so that nothing of them remains.
But if blood overcomes you and prevents you from operating to cut those tissues, then it is better, and of quicker help, to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Because cautery with fire brings together good conditions, the burning of those added tissues, and the cutting off of blood, and the drying of humors.
Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter, or with crushed cabbage leaves, until the place discharges pus, and those burnt tissues come out in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which generate hard flesh: and these are medicines in which there are stypticity and drying.
For when they are restored, then it is healed: and you do not fear a recurrence.
But if a fistula has already reached to the depth of the anus, and is extended by the superfluity of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and search with it.
If therefore you feel a probe, and between you and it is a covering of fat or flesh, and it is near penetration: then there is no operation in that, except according to the way of trust and hope.
That is, because one of three methods is administered to it: either to cauterize it, as we have said: or to excise it, until you obtain its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert a linen cloth, and treatment from nearby. And do not proceed far with the incision, lest you cut the muscle containing the anus, and there happens to the patient an involuntary discharge of excrement. Then treat it with what we have said.
For perhaps it will heal: or you will lengthen that covering, and cleanse it after you have cut it up to near the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or with another instrument of sharp extremity. Then cleanse those filtered flesh which are in the incision, as far as you can with exploration.
Then attempt the restoration of the whole wound with suture, and the upper opening where it consolidates: and a fistula remains open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
And sometimes a fistula is sutured in this manner: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is in the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take a probe of perforated extremity, which is like an aleskef needle, that is, of those preparing hides, according to this form. And insert into it a thread wound from five threads, and around it. Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula, until it reaches its depth.
If therefore it is penetrating into the margin of the anus internally nearby, then pull the thread out from that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring together the two ends: and tighten each, and leave it for one day, or two days: and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those flesh which are between the two ends of the thread are cut, and fall away: then treat the wound, until it consolidates, and heals.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep. For it is not in your power to do this because of the muscle, so that you do not cut it.
Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatulite with which the fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter LXXXI.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
There are hemorrhoids according to two methods. For they are either within the anus, similar to bladders of coals, or plums; or as if they themselves were grape seeds. And of them there are small ones and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many. And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those which are outside the anus are, for the most part, few in moisture, from which flows a yellowish water, or a little blood with a constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is that you instruct the patient to strain; and let it be pressed out until it leaves the anus, and the athelil appear to you. Therefore, also suspend it with hooks; or hold them with your nail. Then incise them at their roots.
But if the hooks do not hold them, because of their moisture and softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a pledget of woolen fabric, and pull them out with your fingers. Then incise them, and sprinkle on them after incision certain hot powders, that they may stand in place of a cautery. Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization. Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
But if the anus does not obey evacuation, then administer an enema to the patient in which there is a little bite, so that what is in the anus may be washed out with it, and it will obey evacuation quickly when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their matter is slight, easy: and it is so that you take them with your nail, or take them with a hook, and incise them. Then treat them with what we said, until they are healed.
And whoever shrinks from incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture according to this method. Take a wound thread, and insert it into a needle. Then draw the hemorrhoid upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at its root from the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, in the lower part of the needle, and let them be crosswise: and bind the hemorrhoid with a strong ligature. Then knot the thread and remove the needle.
Do this with all the hemorrhoids, and leave one of them: nor should you cauterize it, that an excess of blood may flow from it.
Then place on the anus a cloth infused in rose oil, or cerate, and place it over the anus: and instruct the patient to rest. Then leave it until it falls off.
When therefore the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of fissures. For very often they occur from the dryness of the stool and the constriction of nature.
Therefore, when they become old and medicine is ineffective in them, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your nail until they become moist and the upper layer which prevents their healing is removed from them. Then treat them until they heal as is necessary.
But if they do not heal, then scrape them again with greater force than before, until they bleed much and are excoriated; then treat them until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmar, and of dry athelil, and of formica.
Chapter LXXXII.
Know that almirmar is nothing but a round nodule, the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail; and it occurs in the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and pain from them occurs during walking.
Therefore it is necessary that what is around the nail be cut, and held with forceps, or with a hook, and eradicated from its root.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
From dry athelil, however, there is a small, rough, filtered, round prominence on the surface of the body. And they often occur in the hands of children.
And its treatment is that you extend the athelil and incise it: or tie it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was stated with fire, or with a sharp medicine: and now inverted athelil, and non-inverted, are eradicated with the instrument which I shall describe.
An ant, moreover, is also a small, filtered, thick prominence on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when cold finds it, something like the bite of an ant is felt in it, and it occurs in the whole body: and it occurs most in the hands.
And its treatment is that you take a tube from a goose quill, or a strong vulture quill: and place that tube over the ant, until the circle of the tube contains some of it. Then roll your hand with the tube until you cut what is around the ant: and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root.
And if you wish, do it with a tube of bronze, or iron, according to this method.
Let the top of the tube be of a height drawing a rolled-up deafness, so that its grip and its rolling on the finger may be eased.
And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was said before in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Concerning the forms of instruments which are used for clysters in diseases of the anus, and for looseness of the bowels, and colic.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast or hammered bronze.
And sometimes it is made from these instruments, small and large, according to those in whom they are administered.
Therefore that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small: and of those whose anuses are weak or painful, so also their clysters.
A large clyster.
Its tube, that is, the upper head in which the bladder is tied, should be wide in this manner: and let it have a distinction so that the bladder may be tied as you see, and its lower extremity which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, that is, not open, very smooth, tapering to a point: and on one of its sides let there be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
And let the size of the hole be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker, and let the bladder in which the medicines are placed be of an animal's bladder: or of sheepskin, which should be according to the form of a small asofratus: whose root is one palm.
And let it be perforated with many holes as it is rolled up, and let the space which is between each hole be the thickness of a finger. Then insert into those holes strong thread of raw thread, which is made of ten threads, or thereabouts, and gather with it the bag like an asofratus. Therefore, when the bladder is placed in it, let it be tightened at the head of the clyster between two distinctions with a strong constriction. Then clysterize with it.
And this is the form of the bladder here depicted, and of the holes.
Moreover, the method of clysterizing with it is this: that you fill the bladder or vesicle with medicine, which is warmed according to the amount the infirm person can tolerate; and beware lest it be very hot, or very cold.
Then the infirm person is laid on his back, and he raises his legs upwards; and place under him an inthaan, that is, a leather on which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or the like. Then insert it into the anus gently. Then let the attendant take the bladder with both hands together, and squeeze it forcefully until he evacuates all that is in the clyster into the intestine.
Then withdraw the clyster, and let the infirm person raise his legs to the wall.
If the medicine compels him to defecate, then let him hold it back as much as he can. And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more ultimately helpful.
But if you administer a clyster to him for diseases of looseness of the bowels, and his evacuation is hasty, then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
But if there are haemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very subtle, gentle, from among those clysters with which children are clysterized.
And this is the form of a subtle clyster over which the skin is tightly drawn.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already spoken in the division concerning the treatment of wounds which was fitting for the book, and I will here describe their treatment with the hand and with medicines according to the supplement.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore, the things by which wounds are made are many times such as the throwing of a stone, or the incision of a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance or stick or arrow, and similar things from many objects.
Moreover, wounds which are made according to the places of the body are such as a wound which falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver, and similar members.
And I am relating the treatments of certain wounds, so that I may place that reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the consideration of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore. When a simple wound happens in the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throw of a stone, or similar things, and it has now broken only the skin: and it is a large wound, and you fear concerning the unhealthy outcome of a hot abscess: then hasten, and immediately phlebotomize the cephalic vein: and do not delay it: and draw from him blood according to the quantity of his strength: if nothing is prohibiting phlebotomy, especially if the blood which exits from the wound is little. And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part. And let the patient beware of repletion, and wine, and coarse foods.
But if something prohibits bloodletting, then let him be lessened in food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And if a hot abscess happens to it, place on the wound a cotum infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
But if you are secure from a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I shall relate shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place on it certain ointments, until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is from the incision of a sword, and the like: and its lips do not come together by means of lint, then bring them together with a suture, according to what I shall relate in the wounds of the belly concerning their suture.
But if the wound is already laid bare from the bone, and hangs down, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspensory: then incise it. Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as are heads [of grain], and boiled wheat, until it is like pottage: and things like these.
But if you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then incise all the putrefied part, and throw it away: then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not cut off by medicines, then investigate the artery. Therefore if you find it uncut, then cut it with a Spatula, or tie it. But if necessity demands when that which we have said does not help, then cauterize it, until the bleeding is stopped.
But if these wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, light: so that you sprinkle this powder on them: because it consolidates them before the air changes them.
Method of incarnative powder. Take one part frankincense, and two parts dragon’s blood, and three parts of unslaked lime: let the whole be ground finely and sifted: and let the wound be filled with it, and bound tightly, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it above with lint, and leave it, and do not unbind it while it remains, so that it may not fester. For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes the lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense and dragon’s blood at hand; and the lime also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is appropriate to apply it and bind it, and they are fresh wounds with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
But if the air has already altered them in some way, especially in summer, then this powder is not suitable: therefore treat it with what we have said, so that you apply certain digestive ointments: or apply poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until they discharge pus. Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
But if a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with a forceps: and I shall now describe the treatment of head fractures in what is to follow.
Concerning wounds of the neck.
If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment and that of a head wound when it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been cut, then if it is a nerve, there is nothing to be done except to avoid treating it with something that causes strong astringency, such as verdigris and vitriol, and similar things. Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
And do not put anything cold on the wound at all, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the most superior of the members; and let that which cures it be from mild medicines, such as lime washed with fresh water poured over it several times with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when it is also washed with fresh water; and the remaining mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer a suture; or draw together its lips with powders. Then treat it until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep, or a sinus occurs in its lower part, in which pus is already collected, then perforate it in the most depressed place in it.
But if an artery has been cut in the wound, and a flow of its blood has resulted, then separate or cut it and tie it; or cauterize it, if necessity demands it.
But if the vertebrae of the throat, or the whole of it, have been injured, and the al-haudegi have been saved, then bring together the edges of the skin with a suture over the tube of the throat, and do not touch the throat itself; rather, level it and restore it to its natural shape. Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for several days. Then treat it with ointments which possess astringent and drying properties, until it is healed.
But if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then investigate it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of them, or as many as you can: and what is not easily removed, leave it until the wound festers, and the fragment separates and its removal is facilitated.
But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder which I have described. But if bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with that which was mentioned in its chapter.
Concerning a wound in the shoulder blades.
If there is a wound from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider. Therefore if air escapes from the wound when the sick man breathes, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if it is not deep, and is fresh with its blood, then do not apply powder to it at first, nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be retained in its depth and return to the heart and kill the sick man; but apply an attractive ointment, and dissolve it twice a day.
However, if you do not have ointment, then place old lint in the opening of the wound, so that it may absorb what comes from it in terms of moisture; and make the sick man sleep on the wound, so that what gathers in it may flow out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wounding, and the sick man has not experienced spasms, nor a bad tremor of the heart, nor shortness of breath, and you see his other conditions to be good, then know that the wound is safe. Therefore treat it with linen cloths and the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it always opens up again, then know that a fistula has now formed. Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what preceded concerning suture, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and fragments have fallen from it, then explore the wound and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separate. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for their extraction is thereby eased.
The judgment in the treatment of the other wounds occurring in the other members is the same as that which we have described.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, and the protrusion of the intestines, and their exit.
The rupture which happens to the belly is great, moderate, and small.
Therefore, from a large one sometimes an intestine, or a number of intestines, comes forth.
Therefore their replacement and their suture is more forceful and more difficult.
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way. It follows therefore that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hasten in their replacement to their place immediately: because it is inflated, opened, and thickened: wherefore its entry becomes difficult.
Therefore, on account of this, a middle rupture of ruptures is better: because with it the reduction of the intestine does not become difficult, as it becomes difficult in those two types.
Know that the suture of the abdomen is according to four methods.
Two common sutures are suitable for the suture of the abdomen, and for the suture of the other wounds of the body: and two other sutures are proper to the other wounds. Nevertheless, they are more proper with the suture of the abdomen: and I relate to you each one with explanation and clarification.
I say therefore, that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine protrudes from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then that is because of one of two methods. Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: Or because there is inflation in the intestine because of the coldness of the air.
When therefore it is so, then it is necessary that you warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a cloth moistened in tepid water alone. Or boil in water squills, and cyperus, and spica, and embrocate the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does this: and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow, or mallow has been boiled. For by it its entry is eased with a small thing.
But if its return is excused after this cure, then incise a little in the rupture, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than incision: and coercion to incise is not done after necessity and failure of the instrument.
Let one part of it which is twisted be sharp, and the other part of it not sharp, and let the thin end not be with the thinness of a spatula, indeed let it be a little blunter: and it is that which is similar to a cautery, as you see.
Therefore when the wound is widened, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place to itself, if it is possible above it: because it is better.
When however the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head. And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the belly, then put your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which is the wound be higher than the other part.
And thus it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds and in medium wounds.
In small wounds however, put it according to what is prepared for you.
Then cause a devout assistant to be present between your hands, who holds the whole rupture with his hand: and bring together its lips. Then uncover from it to him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the method of the common suture of one.
And it is that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the size of the wound. Then leave from the end of the rupture the quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician: and fix one needle except that you insert into it thread in two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of the sifac which is under the skin from the insides, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side, and you have now brought together two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the sifac: and four rows are made.
Then tighten with doubled thread around the needle several times from the two parts together, until the two lips of the wound are joined with decent joining.
Then leave the thickness of a finger also, and fix in them another needle; afterwards tie it with thread, as you did with the first needle. Therefore do not cease doing that with as many needles as you need, until you complete the constriction of the whole wound.
And let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness: because thin needles very quickly cut the flesh: and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin: on account of that it is necessary that they be medium in thinness and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in two extremities of the skin very close together: lest the flesh be quickly cut, and the wound be opened before its consolidation, and they not be elongated with the suture, lest the wound be prevented from consolidation.
Then cut off the point of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient in his sleep: and place on them little cushions of cloth on every side, which hold the points of the needles: and leave them until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
And indeed this kind of suture with needles is more suitable in small wounds. Because one needle, or two, or about that many, suffice in their suture.
The second suture however is common, so that you bring together with the suture four extremities: two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the fascia at one time, with a needle in which is wrapped thread equal in fineness and thickness.
Then when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, return the needle from the side from which you began the same, so that the drawn thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is like the seam of a cloth by which cloths are sewn together, and place between each suture the amount of the thickness of the little finger.
And this suture men know.
And with this suture I sewed a wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than one palm: and there protruded from the intestines about two palms of the middle intestine, and the disruption was in the middle of the belly.
Therefore I returned it after its intestine had stood outside the wound twenty-four hours.
Therefore the wound was consolidated in the space of about fifteen days: and I treated him, and he was healed: and he lived after that many years, engaged in his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment. Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor anything of medicines, was found. Therefore I placed old lint on the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
But I shall describe two kinds of suture proper to the subject.
And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and the muscle going according to the length and breadth of the whole body: leave the end of the sifac on the side in which you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inside to the outside at the other end of the mirach.
When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate accordingly in the same end of the mirach from the outside to the inside: and leave the end of the sifac, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate to the other end from the inside to the outside: and make it penetrate with your penetration with which you make it penetrate into the sifac at the end of the mirach, which is in its part, until it penetrates into the whole of it.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the end, which is of the sifac on the other side, and draw the needle out of the skin which it penetrated.
Then return it to that skin, and sew the end of the sifac, which is on the other side, with this end of the mirach: and draw it out of the skin which is on its side, and do that once, and again: and do it turn by turn, until you sew the whole outside according to that example.
And the sum of this suture is that you sew the suture of the leatherworkers as they sew leathers: so that you sew the sifac once from one side with one end of the skin: and that you leave it another time from the other side, until you complete it.
The second kind of proper suture, which Galen mentioned.
This speech of his is narrated, so that you sew it according to the likeness in which some physicians sew, so that they bring together each part to its corresponding part naturally suitable: and they apply the end of the sifac to its other end, and the end of the mirach to its other end. And that is done as I tell you.
It is necessary that you fix the needle in the end of the mirach near to you from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner part in that alone: and leave the two ends of the sifac. Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outer part to the inner part in the two ends of the sifac, namely on both sides.
Then turn both, also make them penetrate from the inner to the outer, into the two other ends of the mirach, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and it is the suture whose mention preceded.
This is therefore also the word of Galen.
And some said. The suture of the abdomen is straightened with two needles. That is, you insert one thread into both, and begin with the insertion of the needle, from what is near you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew hides equally.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suture is more difficult than in other places of the abdomen.
The judgment, however, of the medication of the wound, is the judgment of other wounds.
That is, because when you find a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and its own, and fit it, then put on incarnative powder.
But if the air has already altered the wound, then put on it certain ointments which are present to you, until they produce pus, and the threads fall out, and the sifac and mirach consolidate. Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it heals.
But if you do not have medicines present, then immediately put on it, from when it begins to emit pus, old lint; and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
For you do not need other medication in most instances, when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound communicates with the principal members in the injury, then it is necessary that you submerge soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and put it around the areas which are between the groins and under the armpits.
But if he feels pain, or pricking, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then clysterize him with astringent, black, warm wine; especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine and has become an exit penetrating to its concavity.
And know that what is from the large intestine is of easier healing, and what is from the small intestine is of more difficult healing.
But the intestine which is called the jejunum does not receive healing from a wound which happens in it at all; and that is because of its multitude, which is of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
But if what proceeds from the wound is a hernia, and you catch it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce intestines equally.
If, however, a space has passed, and it has already become green or black, then it is necessary that you constrict it with thread above the place which is blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not happen. For in a hernia are veins and arteries.
Then incise what is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that its traction and extraction in the case of a hernia, and the emission of pus from the wound, may be lessened for you.
Concerning a wound which happens in the intestine.
When a rupture happens in the intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some men; therefore, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a lance thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old, and a fistula was made, and excretion and flatulence came from it.
Therefore I applied a treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until it was healed, and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place now consolidated, I feared for the patient, that some evil accident might befall him in his belly; and no evil accident befell him from that. And he remained in better condition, eating and drinking, and copulating, and entering the bath, and exercising according to his diet.
And now some experienced men have said that when a wound happens in the intestine, and it is small, then it ought to be ligated in this manner. And it is, that you take ants with large heads. Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one of those ants which have an open mouth over the two lips of the wound. When therefore it gets on top of it, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere, and not be loosened.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease doing that with ant after ant according to the quantity of the whole wound.
Then reduce it, and sew the wound. For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is nourished, and healed, and no harm at all happens to the patient.
And now it is possible that the intestine may also be tied with a fine thread: which has been wiped from the intestine of an animal, attached with it after it is inserted into the needle.
And it is so that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is much thinned. Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its end. Then insert that thread into a needle, and sew the intestine with it. Then return it into the rupture.
And this method of suture with ants and intestine is only according to a way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy except thinning, nor is its healing at all.
Concerning the treatment of Zuchamen and fistulas.
Know that every wound or abscess when it grows old and becomes ancient, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and always emits pus, and is not incised: then it is universally called a fistula in whatever member it may be, and we call it Zuchamen.
And a fistula indeed is, according to the truth, a filtered, hard, white knot: with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather: and because of that some call it Risati, that is, a feather.
And it is in some hours moist, which emits pus. And perhaps the moisture is split in some hours. And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little: and it is thick, and it is thin.
And I already premised in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which is not healed, nor does flesh grow in it, is not that except because of one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of its bad quality: or because between it, and upon its lips is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh: or because there is much dirt and filth: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter which is emitted from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is unsuitable in its cure: or because the corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, or through a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which the digestion of illnesses is difficult, and the healing of abscesses is delayed in it by nature: or because in it is one bone, or a number of bones.
And I already showed all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here that I make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by way of operation with the hand.
Know therefore, that fistula happens in all the members of the body. For of them are fistulas which reach to large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sifac: or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs: or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the compound joints in their composition: such as the hand, and the foot: and of them are those which go to the proximity of a principal member, and similar things.
Therefore whichever of these fistulas is according to this manner, is of the illnesses difficult of healing, and does not receive cure, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
But if there is some fistula whose depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned: and you hope, and trust in its cure, and wish to arrive at the knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze, or iron, if the fistula extends in a straight line, and search it with that.
But if in the fistula there is tortuosity, then investigate it with a probe of thin lead. Because lead, with the softness of its body, is eased, and is bent around the tortuosity.
But if the fistula has many orifices, it is not possible for you to signify concerning it with a probe. Therefore, inject a clyster into one of its orifices.
For the moisture with which you inject a clyster into it goes towards the other orifices, and runs out of them.
Then inquire exquisitely, in whatever way is possible for you, so that you may know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the cavity of the fistula is distant or near; or whether it is one fistula which has many orifices, and attend to all of that, with the greatest strength, with your questioning, by which you question the infirm, and by finding pain upon compression with your hand upon the place, and similar signs and causes happening to an abscess.
Therefore, when you have considered all those things truly, then proceed to treatment with confidence; and it is, that you should then consider if the fistula is near and apparent, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then incise the fistula as is premised in my account, and remove what is in it of pus, and corrupt flesh, which grows in its orifice from flesh or thelul, and the like: and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it deeply as much as is possible for you. Then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh.
Then apply pledgets wrapped in sharp medicines; and introduce them to the cavity of the fistula which you have explored with an instrument: do this with it several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it heals.
But if it is not healed by that, then cauterize it as we have described.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is a bone, and this is ascertained by you: then investigate it, and cut it as I have told you: if nothing prevents you from a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we have said.
If therefore a bone is discovered, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it until all its corruption is removed. Then treat it with that which causes it to grow flesh, until it heals.
But if it is not healed, and emits pus as it did before: then know that you have not arrived at the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore investigate it again, and carefully perform its scraping and cleansing with your utmost strength.
Then restore it. If therefore it heals, it is good: and if not, then know that that corruption is in a distant depth of the body, which you have not reached. Therefore you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
But if a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps which are suitable for it.
But if there are many bones, then skillfully perform the extraction of them all, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
If however something of the humors opposes you, and there is no fear or mistake in incising them: then incise those humors and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
If however you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then apply something to the wound which will cause it to putrefy: and leave it until that which is around those bones of flesh and humors has putrefied.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal. And let the incision which you made in your operation be constricted. Rather, if you fear, place upon it a pledget soaked in crushed sulfur with oil: or a pledget soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
For when those humors putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction is made easier.
But if it is one large bone, such as a bone of the leg, or a hip bone, and similar ones, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the ultimate method, until that blackness and corruption is removed. Then restore the wound.
But if that which is corrupted in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and to cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is consolidated.
And I tell you a case, which happened to a man in his leg: so that you may place it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a man, young in age, about thirty years old, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause which moved upon it within the body, that is, from the interior, until the materials reached the leg, and it became an abscess with a large abscess: and there was no external cause for it.
Therefore, a time was spent with him in error by the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many materials came together with it. And the treatment of it was delayed, until the leg became fistulated, and many openings were made in it: all of which emitted pus and the humors of the body.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one wise in the art of the hand, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials which ran from those openings with a great flow: indeed, the whole body of the man was now wasted, and his color was yellow.
Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to reach each other from all parts of the leg.
Therefore I prepared, and cut above one of those openings, until I uncovered a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was now corroded, and blackened, and putrefied, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore I sawed what was revealed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away and sawed. And I had now eradicated it.
Then I applied a restoration to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time. And it was not consolidated.
Then I tried, and I uncovered the bone a second time above the first uncovering: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I sawed what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Then I attempted its restoration. And it was not restored.
Therefore I uncovered it again, and I did not cease cutting the bone in parts, and trying its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut from the bone about one palm, and extracted it with its marrow.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and healed: and this repetition in its operation, and section of it, was not necessary except because of the disposition of the weakness of the infirm, and the smallness of his tolerance, and my fear for him of death: because there happened to him at all hours from the superabundance of evacuation bad fainting spells.
Therefore he was healed with a whole healing: and there grew in the place of the bone hard flesh, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he conversed in his dispositions: and it did him no contrary harm in walking at all.
But if the prominent bone in the place of the body is already broken: then it is necessary that you saw it, according to this method: and it is: that you take a ligament, and bind it at the extremity of the prominent bone: and instruct someone, who extends it upwards: and put another ligament of wool thicker than the first ligament. Then bind it over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you draw the flesh downwards: and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place a piece of wood, or a board, decently under the bone below: because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be a little over the corrupted place, so that there is not corruption in the concavity of the bone: and that it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and compels to another sawing in its place.
But if the bone is corrupted, and is not prominent, but rather a part of it is continuous with a part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in a part of it: then uncover the flesh from all parts entirely. Then place wood below.
Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued from the other part: and let the sawing be according to the length from the corruption a little, according to what we said.
But if the corruption is in a joint, cut into the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it is continuous from the other part.
If however the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it except abrasion.
But if the corruption is in the metacarpus, or in the metatarsus: then the matter is very difficult in it. Truly it is necessary that you inquire how the corruption appears to you. And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever instrument is rectified for you: when it does not oppose you, a vein, or a nerve.
And know that scalpels and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their subtlety, and their magnitude, and their smallness, and their hardness, and their rarity. Therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument suitable to that operation.
And know that these operations signify to you the kind of instrument you need, when there is long study with you. And knowledge of the methods of this art, testimony of the methods of illnesses: then indeed you will find by yourself that which is suitable to it from the instruments for every infirmity.
And I am confirming for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will put as examples upon which you will cut, and the proof by which you will test upon others.
The shape of another saw.
The shape of a joint rasp. Let the head of this rasp be according to the shape of the head of a star-headed nail; and let its points be according to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not suitable except to rub with it the heads of joints, when they are corrupted, or a bone which is large and great.
The shape of a larger rasp.
The shape of a broad rasp.
The shape of a rasp in which there is a concavity.
The shape of another, slender rasp.
The shape of another rasp with a curved end.
The shape of a small, slender, thin rasp.
This is similar to a saw, and the end is like a saw; it is shown in many places on account of the bones.
The shape of a rasp which is suitable for rasping that which has been perforated from bones.
Its end is triangular, of sharp points.
It is made of Indian (material). And similarly it is necessary that all those things which we have spoken of be made from rasps, and incisors, and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Extremities putrefy, either from an external or internal cause.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and the treatment does not help, and you see the corruption cutting into the member, which nothing repels: then it is necessary that you incise that member until where the corruption reaches, so that the sick person may escape death through it, or the harm which is greater than the defect of the member.
And the sign that this happens is that the member blackens until it seems that fire has burned it, or it putrefies after blackness, until that putrefaction is incised until what follows that member, and creeps into the whole body.
Therefore hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the striking of certain poisonous things: such as a sea scorpion, and viper, and a small wheel, and similar things.
If therefore the corruption or blow is in the extremity of a finger, then incise the finger, and do not give space to the corruption, that it may proceed to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens in the hand, then incise it from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes hold in the forearm.
And if it invades it, then incise the arm at the elbow in its joint.
But if the corruption passes through, and you see it around the elbow: then in that is the death of the infirm. And to administer beyond that in treatment, is a matter of skill.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then incise it at one of the joints; and if it takes hold in the instep, then incise the whole foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then incise the leg at the knee joint.
But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except to leave it, and leave the infirm to death.
And the method of incising a limb, or sawing it, is to tighten a ligature below what you wish to incise; and tighten another ligature above the place. And let one assistant extend the lower ligature; and let another assistant extend the upper ligature upwards. And you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed. Then let it be incised, or sawn.
And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw does not touch the healthy place; and let added injury and a hot abscess happen to the sick person.
But if bleeding occurs internally while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly; or place upon it some powders which stanch blood. Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a bandage suitable to it, and care for it until it is healed.
And I tell you that which happened to a man in his foot, the same accident that I tell you.
Which is, because there happened in his foot a blackness, with a burning which is similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption at first happened in his toe, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Therefore the man hastened of himself, after he saw the corruption falling upon the limb with its vehemence, which he found from its pain and burning: and he cut it off at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time passed for him, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand.
Therefore he came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with what I put on his hand of medicines after the cleansing of his body: and the excess was not repulsed, and it began to go into another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Therefore he called me, to cut off his hand: and I did not want that, hoping from myself concerning the repelling of that excess: and I also feared for him concerning the cutting off of his hand, death. Because the strength of the man was beyond measure.
Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his own land: and it came to me concerning him, that he hastened, and cut off his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not brought this account, except that it may be a help concerning that which falls under the kind of this sickness: and that there may be a signification by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be treated.
Concerning the treatment of fistulas, and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it makes a collection of pus: then it breaks, or is perforated, and that which is in it of pus goes out, and an empty space remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like a cloth which has already been thinned: and it does not arrive at the ultimate in its corruption, nor does it impress on bone, nor on nerve, nor on ligament: it deserves to be named Sinus: and it is not named Fistula: nevertheless if its space is prolonged until the corruption impresses on any of these members, then it is named Fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is that you incise all that skin as it is rolled up: and especially when it is thinned, and made like a cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin adheres, and that ultimate corruption does not follow from it: and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster: and it is, that you consider the Sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus which is emitted from it is foul-smelling: then clysterize it with the Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, they are gathered in a vessel: and they are decocted over a fire until the medicine reddens: and comes to the thickness of honey.
Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the Sinus with it: and bind its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
Then draw it out with expression: do this for so many days, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the stench is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present to you: and it is, that you take the ash of vine wood, or ash from oak wood: and pour water over it. Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now washed.
But if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey, to which something of crushed ziniar is already mixed. Or clysterize him with mixed honey and wine, because it is of the property of honey to cleanse and wash; and wine makes the Sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the Sinus is now removed: then clysterize him with that which makes flesh grow in it.
And it is, that you take of diafinicon plaster: and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or clysterize him with certain other medicines and ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
But if the orifice of the Sinus is narrow, into which the clyster cannula does not fit: then widen it slightly with iron: or place in it a linen cloth rolled up in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is widened.
And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then bring together its lips with a suture: and leave from it an amount into which a clyster may enter without addition.
And similarly if the orifice from which pus runs is elevated to the upper parts: then cut it in a lower place which is in it, so that the pus runs down from it: because pus, when constricted in the depth of the Sinus, prevents flesh from growing in it.
But if it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus around its lower part as you wish: then try to prepare the member with a preparation by which pus may run from it easily, according to what is prepared for you. Try that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take consolidative medicines which are placed on a wound, suitable to what you wish. And spread them on a linen cloth. And let the cloth be of such a quantity that the whole Sinus is covered. Then cut with scissors in a straight line with the opening of the Sinus a hole, a little larger than the opening of the Sinus. Then spread some mild ointments on another cloth, according to the size of the hole: and place it over it at a distance from the opening of the Sinus, so that the exit of pus from it is eased: and do not remove the large cloth, except after a few days at one time.
But the one which is over the opening of the Sinus, is the one which you remove every hour, so that what is collected in it from pus may come out: and so that you know whether that which flows from it, the virus, is much or little: or digested or undigested.
And with this again consider the place of the Sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or there is no abscess in it.
When therefore your medication is extended in this way, and you see the matter which comes out over the opening of the Sinus, then know that the Sinus is now adhering, or approaching adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
But if a subtle virus comes out of the Sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and among them there are those who act contrary to that.
But if undigested pus comes out of the Sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If therefore the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed, and its matter is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, truly let the physicians do, so that the medicines are moist in their substance, and dry in their virtue: such as diafinicon ointment, when an excess of addition from zegi is added to it.
And of the last things by which it is cured, is that you take diafinicon ointment, and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it old wine equal in its substance.
Then mix it with it, and use it.
And now it does something similar to this action, when you do not have diafinicon ointment present, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and you use it. Or take myrrh, and aloe, and olibanum: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire. Then spread over it a cloth, and bind it over the sinus: and spread with the honey which you boiled until it thickened: and powder over it the spices, and put over it a cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes there is administered in it long birthwort, and roots of the celestial lily, and there is lily: and herb flour, and centaury. Use them simple, or aggregated, grind them, and sift them: and powder over the honey which I have described, and use it.
But if the matter of the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this cure: then know that in its depth is corruption: or it already makes an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then cure it with the cure of fistulas, according to what has been premised.
Concerning the cure of whitlow and rubbed nail, and the incision of the added finger, and section.
Whitlow is an abscess which is born under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot: and perhaps it is born in the other fingers.
When therefore its matter is prolonged, and its cure is neglected, and it becomes inflamed with a hot abscess: or it is corrupted, and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches to the bone, until it has a fetid odour: and the end of the finger becomes broad, and its colour becomes dark.
When therefore you cure it, with that which we said in the division, and your cure does not help: then it is necessary that you incise with iron all the superfluity which remains from the nail. Then cauterize the wound after that. For cautery is very helpful.
If however the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail already compress the flesh inwards, and begin to pierce it, and injure it: then it is necessary that you place a thin probe under the angle of the nail which pierces the flesh, and push it upwards: and incise that flesh easily, and place upon what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until the whole of it is removed. Then cure it with ointments, until it is healed.
But if the corruption already penetrates the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone, and extract it: for it is never healed while the corrupted bone remains in it.
But if you see corrosion and corruption proceeding in the finger, then incise it at one of the joints, according to what has been previously mentioned. Then cure it until it is healed.
But if attrition or percussion happens to the nail, and intense pain occurs, then it is necessary that you first bleed the patient. Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, with a transverse incision from above downwards.
And take care that the incision does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will thereby cause intense pain to the patient, and it will be a cause for the growth of added flesh in the place.
Then treat the area with something that soothes pain.
Moreover, the added digit which grows on the hands of some people is perhaps wholly fleshy; and perhaps in some of them there are bones, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them grow at the root of a joint, or their growth is in some of the knuckles of the finger. Therefore, that which grows in some of the knuckles of a finger does not move; and that which grows near the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Therefore, that which is fleshy among them, its incision is easy. That is, to incise it at its root with a broad spatula.
However, the treatment of that whose growth is at the root of a joint is difficult. Therefore, abstain from its incision.
However, in that which grows in a finger near the last knuckle, then it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a circular incision down to the bone. Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it. Then treat it until it heals.
Now, the adhesion which happens to fingers mutually, very often happens either from a person's birth, that is, he is born with it, or from the healing of a wound, or a burn by fire, and similar things.
Therefore it is necessary that you separate that adhesion until the fingers return to their natural form. Then place between them linen cloths, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them; or place between them a thin lead plate until the place heals as it should.
And similarly if adhesion happens to some fingers with the palm, then cut that adhesion, according to what is prepared and suits the shape of the member.
Concerning the incision of vitiated parts.
Varicose veins are twisted, thick veins, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many parts of the body; and their occurrence is most frequent in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and work, and who carry burdens.
Therefore it is necessary that you administer shaking of the body from black bile, sometimes with strong shaking.
Then phlebotomize the patient in the basilic vein.
The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods. One of them is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out. And the other method is that the vein is raised, and the whole is drawn out.
Its section, however, is according to this method. First bathe the leg with much warm water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved. Then bind the leg of the sick person from the upper part of his hip to the lower part of the knee with a bandage. Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then raise, that is, draw out the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and the phlebotomist should do this to the sick person first from the upper part. Then cut the vein downwards until a quantity of blood comes out which you see to be sufficient and which the strength of the sick person can bear.
Afterwards bind it and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile; and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full and it harms the sick person.
Its elevation is in this manner. Shave the leg of the sick person if there is much hair on it. Then put him in a bath, or rub his leg with warm water until it becomes red and the veins swell; or let him perform vigorous exercise, if a bath is not readily available, until the limb is warm.
Then cut the skin lengthwise in a straight line with the vein incision, either at its end near the knee or in its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks and expose the vein on all sides until it is visible; and when it appears, you will see that it is red tending toward blackness. When it is removed from the skin, you see it white as if it were a cord.
Then insert a spatula underneath it until it is raised and emerges from the skin; suspend it gently with a blunt hook.
Then make another incision three fingers' breadth from that incision. Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears. Then raise it with spatulas as you did before, and suspend it with another hook, as you did before.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need it. Then raise it, and incise it with the last incision near the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision which is above it.
And do this until you pull it out from the incision which is higher, or higher than all the incisions, until when it comes out completely: then incise it.
But if it does not obey you to be pulled out and raised: then insert a needle with strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it out: or insert a probe under it: and roll your hand to every part, until it comes out. And beware lest it be incised. For if it is incised, it becomes difficult for you to raise it strongly, and harm enters upon the sick person from it.
Therefore, when you have pulled it out completely: then place on the place of the wounds wool submerged in wine and rose oil, or oil: and cure it, until it is healed.
But if the vine is contracted, having a tortuosity to which there is a winding around to the parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary that you split it on every part of its tortuosity, and the places of its winding.
Then suspend it with hooks, until you raise it completely: and beware in your section upon it lest you cut a vein, or wound it: for it will become difficult for you to raise, or extract it. Therefore, preserve your prudence.
The form of the incision by which the vine is healed.
The form of the blind hook.
It does not have a curve like the other hooks, nor is it sharp-ended, so that it does not wound a vein: and it is of thick, gentle curvature: because if it were thin, it would cut a vein by its thinness: indeed, let it have superfluous thickness, as we have said.
On the extraction of a vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Algezira, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands of little softness, that is, in which grass nor tree grows.
And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body besides the legs.
And its generation indeed is from putrefaction which happens under the skin, just as serpents and ascarid worms happen within bodies, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein is that a vehement inflammation happens in the leg. Then the place is blistered. Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
When therefore its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary that you wrap over it a piece of lead, whose weight is from one keil drachm up to two drachms, and tie it: and let the lead hang down from the leg.
As often therefore as something comes out of it to the exterior, wrap that in lead, and tie it. But if it is prolonged much, then cut part of it, and wrap up the remainder. And do not cut it off completely before it comes out entirely. Because if you cut it, it contracts, and enters into the flesh: and it causes an abscess, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it is necessary that it be treated gently, and drawn out little by little, until it comes out to the last of it, and nothing of it remains in the body: and from this vein indeed comes out in some men that which is in its length five palms and ten. And now it has come to me, that it came out of a man of twenty palms.
But if it is cut into during your treatment: then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long opening, with a body, until all that is in it of matter is evacuated: and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days. Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings happen to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Therefore treat it, as we said in the division, and with what was premised.
Concerning the incision upon worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
This illness is called in a certain land among us bovine illness, because, for the reason that very often it happens to cattle, and it is a small single worm which is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending; and its movement from member to member is shown to the sense, until it bursts wherever it bursts a place in the skin, and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors. Just as worms and snakes happen, that is, roundworms and pinworms, in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice. Because when it goes in the body and rises to the head and arrives at a place, then perhaps it opens there and emerges and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, then this is not done except during its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore it is necessary that you bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong ligature. Then cut over it and extract it.
But if it penetrates deeply into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the place until it dies.
And what is more feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
But if you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind the eyebrow below it with a good ligature. Then cut over it and extract it.
And it is necessary that the patient use purification of his body with medicines dissolving bad putrid humors.
And let him beware of foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the illness Nakir.
This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain which happens in certain members: then it is transferred from member to member.
And I indeed already saw it, according to what I relate to you. I was called to a woman ill in certain villages. And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's rope.
And after I remained one hour, I saw one swelling proceeding with speed, as a worm proceeds, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it can be: so that it is like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Therefore the pain departed from that place, and was fixed in the shoulder.
Then I sat one hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it arrived in the other arm.
Then she related to me that it was revolving in her whole body, according to what I saw.
Therefore I was amazed at the speed of its change from member to member. And indeed I had not before seen this illness with my own eyes in this manner. Nevertheless I saw many who find pain changing from member to member: and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
And I do not think it is, except that it is because the woman was of those who are of the villages of dry bodies with uncovered veins: hence therefore that changed windiness appears to the sense.
And it is necessary that they not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
When therefore you wish its cure, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to you to the eye, as we said, then bind above it, and below it quickly: and cut above it, until that constricted windiness comes out: and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see it with your eyes: then cure it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels windiness, and removes it with fetid pills, and pills of serapinum, and similar things.
Concerning the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their kinds, and according to the places in which they fall in the body.
Their diversity is this: for among them are those which have large and small points: and concave and blunt ones. And among them are those which have three angles. And among them are those which have barbs. And among them are those which have barbs.
Those, however, which are according to the members in which they fall, are according to two methods. For either the members are of the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar things. Therefore when it falls into any of these members, and the signs of death, which I shall tell you later, appear to you, then it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in most instances. And when those bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and exits the membrane which is above the brain, are: that there happen from it vehement thirst, and dimness of vision, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile. And perhaps blood comes out from the nostrils, or ears. And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed. And a white moisture similar to porridge comes out from the place of the wound. And something similar to the wateriness of flesh comes out of it.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs, however, of an arrow when it falls into the heart, are: that it is near the left nipple; and one feels with it as if it were fixed in something hard, not in something empty. And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to the movement of the pulse; and black blood runs from the wound. And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting. Know therefore that death approaches without doubt.
And a sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung, is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels which follow the neck become suppurated, and the color of the sick person changes. And he breathes out a large, deep breath; and he seeks the intake of cold air.
But if the arrow falls on the membrane which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and there is great shortness of breath with intense pain, with sighing: and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the belly, and is fixed in it: something of the excrement comes out of the wound, or pus, or intestine which is already broken. Therefore there is no hope in his cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
But if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger upon the sick man: then know, that it is mortal.
The remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and armpit, and the vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are saved according to several dispositions: when the arrow does not find an artery, or nerve: and the arrow is not venomous.
And I tell you what I saw of the nature of these arrows, that you may signify by that concerning your cure.
That is, because an arrow fell upon a certain man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of the nose. Therefore I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell upon him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained from it only a small extremity, with which it adhered to its wood: and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no barbs.
Therefore the Jew was healed, and no evil accident happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is one which has barbs. Therefore I made an incision upon it between two guide-strings: and it was already submerged in his throat. Therefore I worked delicately with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
After therefore thirty days had passed him, and nothing of his condition had changed, I made an incision upon the arrow: and I worked upon it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no ill effect happened to him.
And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound had closed over it. After therefore seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman into whose belly an arrow had fallen, and the wound had closed over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and none of her condition changed, and the woman found no harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, into whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound closed, and it remained, causing him not much pain: and many similar cases to these.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the King's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already deviated a little to the right side: and the whole arrow was hidden.
Therefore I was called to his treatment after the arrow wound for three days. Therefore I found the arrow wound very tight.
Therefore I searched for it with a thin probe, and did not feel it: and he indeed felt a pricking and pain under his right ear. Therefore I hoped that that pricking was from the point of the arrow.
Therefore I plastered the place with a plaster which had attractive and digestive power, trusting that the place would suppurate, and the sign of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could cut upon it: and there did not happen in the place an event signifying that the arrow had reached the place.
Therefore I persevered with the plaster upon him for many days: and there did not happen an event, and the wound meanwhile healed: and he remained ill from the extraction of it for a space of days, until he felt the arrow on a certain day within his nose. And he related that to me.
And he related that to me. Therefore I placed upon that wound a sharp, corrosive medicine for many days, until it was opened: and when I probed it, I felt the point of a slender arrow adhering to the wood.
Then I enlarged the opening of the wound by that sharp medicine, until the point of the arrow appeared visibly to us: and there passed for me with him a space of time of about four months.
Then after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not yield to extraction: then I did not cease to refine, and devise concerning it with ingenious methods, until I began on it on a certain day with decently made forceps, according to what their form will be at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it. Then I restored the wound.
And indeed physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored. Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the patient was healed with complete health: nor did anything at all harm him.
And I relate to you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place that as a rule and explanation concerning what I have not said.
Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not grasped with narration: nor does the book contain that, and a prudent craftsman compares a little with much: and with that which is present, with that which is absent: and finds a new operation, and a new instrument in the course of extraneous things of this art when they happen.
Therefore I say that arrows do not come out from the members in which they are fixed except in two ways. Or by traction from the place from which it entered. Or by the opposite of the other part.
And that which goes out from where it entered, is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and it is pulled, and it goes out.
But if it does not obey exit at the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it for some days, until the flesh which is around it putrefies: and its traction is lessened, and its exit.
And similarly if it is fixed in bone, and it does not obey you for exit, then leave it also for some days: and repeat it with traction and movement every day, until it goes out.
But if it does not obey you for exit after days, then it is necessary that you perforate around the arrow in the bone itself on every side with a thin drill, until the arrow is widened. Then pull it, and extract it.
But if the arrow is now hidden in a place of the body, and is hidden and concealed from the senses: then search for it with a probe. But if you feel it, then pull it out with certain instruments which are suitable for its extraction.
But if you cannot reach it, because of the tightness of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in the depth: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then cut upon it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
But if it has barbs by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed in them on every side, by every means which you can, and by means, if it cannot be released without breaking the barbs and twisting them, until it comes out.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, in whichever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you make it come out: and the finest things with the finest subtlety, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
But if you cannot reach it within an hour, then leave it for several days, until those things which are around it putrefy. Then try again; for the swelling will be lessened. But if the flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we said in its chapter concerning treatment; and guard your skill from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
And administer the means in every way that is possible for you to remove the arrow: and let that be with ease and calmness, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that, when you pull out the arrow, you make the patient lie down in the position in which he was at the time of the arrow's impact. Because it is more helpful. But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from among the positions.
But an arrow which exits from the opposite side, or something of it already proceeds outwards: or the point of the arrow makes a swelling by sensation on the upper part of the nearby skin, and you see it prominent: therefore cut above it, and let the incision be such that forceps can grasp it.
Then pull it out: for it will then be easy to remove.
But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until the arrow is embedded in the bone, and widens itself; then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for several days; then try again until it comes out.
But if the wood of the arrow is in it, then push it out with it.
But if the wood has fallen off, and you wish to administer a push: then insert a concave instrument so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow; then push it out with that.
But if the arrow is concave, then push it out with an instrument entering into it. For the arrow is lightened by it.
But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you hollow out all the flesh in which is the poison, if it is possible for you. Then treat it with what is suitable for it.
But if the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near to what you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then sew the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be similar to a bird's beak, which are made like hooks: when they grasp the arrow, they do not let go of it.
And many kinds are made of them, large and small and medium-sized, according to the size and smallness of the arrow, and the size of the wound, and its narrowness.
The form of the concave pusher.
And the form of the blunt pusher.
This is a blunt end like a radius, so that its entry into the concave arrow is eased, and it is pushed with it.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
The veins to be phlebotomized, whose custom has run in the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbae; and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two lachrymal ducts of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein which is at the tip of the nose. And two Guidegi, which are in the neck. And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two veins which are in the lower lip. And these are the veins which are called Algecherich. And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins, moreover, which are bled in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the outer side: and the common people call it the vein of the head. And the dark one. And there is the median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic: and the common people call it the vein of the body. And the basilic, and it is situated on the inner side: and it is also called the titillicaris. And the common people call it the vein of the belly. And the cord of the arm, and it is situated above the wrist; and it is that in which bloodletting is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with manifest application.
And the salvatella: and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins. One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb from the outer side. And the second is the saphena: and its location is near the heel from the inner side. And the vein Nesse: and its location is near the heel from the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomy of the two veins which are behind the ears, however, is beneficial for chronic catarrhs, and hemicrania, and  deafness, and chronic bad head ulcers.
And the quality of phlebotomizing it is as I relate. And it is so that the head of the patient is shaved: and his occiput in the place of the two veins is rubbed with a rough cloth with a good rubbing. Then the patient should constrict his neck with a bandage until the two veins appear. And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head. Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there mark with ink.
Then take a lancet phlebotome, and it is that which is called Incidens. Then insert it under the vein in the skin until the phlebotome reaches the opening. Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and incise the vein with the skin with an incisive incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or about that: and let as much blood flow out as you wish.
Then bind it with pledgets, and leave it until it heals.
And already the incision and cauterization of them preceded in the beginning of the book.
Truly, the two arteries which are in the two times of phlebotomy are helpful for chronic hemicrania, and bad toothache, and persistent ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp effused superfluities to the eyes.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I relate to you. Let the sick person strongly constrict his neck until two veins appear manifestly to the sense of sight: and let their pulse be demonstrated under your finger. Then mark them with cautery.
Then raise the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the cutting phlebotome underneath, and raise the vein upwards. And incise it, as you did in the other two veins: and make the blood flow according to the amount of your necessity.
Then loosen the constriction of the sick person, and place your finger on the vein for one hour. Afterwards, place a compress and pledgets over it, and bind it tightly above: and leave it until it heals.
And now the recollection of them, and their incision, and their extraction has preceded in the beginning of the book.
The benefit, however, of phlebotomy of the vein of the forehead is, after phlebotomy of the Cephalic, for old facial ailments: and for hemicrania, and redness: and foul ulcers.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is, according to what I tell you. The sick person constricts his neck with a bandage until the vein appears. Then take the instrument which is called a Fossorium.
Place the prominent point which is on the head of the Fossorium over the vein itself, and strike upon it with a comb, or with another thing in its manner: and let the blood run according to the quantity which you wish. Then loosen the perforation of the sick person, and bind it until it heals.
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotome. However, it is not necessary that the phlebotome be of a sharp point, like the other phlebotomes; indeed, it should be of a broad point. And phlebotomize it according to the crosswise direction: because the bone is near; and perhaps the phlebotome will break in it when it is thin.
Moreover, the benefit of the two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes is for the eye from scab and redness; and for sebaceous cysts in the eye, and for diseases of the face.
And the manner of their phlebotomy is that the infirm person should bind his neck with a headband. Then phlebotomize them; and you should be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made transversely to a small length, with a small, somewhat broad phlebotome, for there is no flesh in the place. For if the phlebotome is of a thin point, perhaps it will break.
Then cause to flow as much blood as is necessary for you. And place a pledget upon them, and bind them for one night, and unbind them.
Moreover, the phlebotomy of the veins of the nose is beneficial for acute fever, and violent headache, and diseases of the face, such as hemicrania, and redness which happens in the face: especially when it is longstanding.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the infirm person should constrict his neck. Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long phlebotomy instrument; and insert it in the middle of his nose, between that which divides the nose according to its straightness. Because the vein does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the phlebotomy instrument a little while; and you should make the blood flow according to your need. Then bind it for one night. For it is restored quickly.
Indeed, the phlebotomy of the two Guidegi is helpful for shortness of breath, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that eat away, that is, herpetic esthiomenes.
And the manner of their phlebotomy is that the sick person should be bound under both in his neck with a ligature; and the surgeon should stand above the head of the sick person, and the sick person should be sitting on a seat.
Then the phlebotomist opens the vein to the length of a wide phlebotomy a little. Then draw out a moderate quantity of blood, or according to what you see is necessary for it. Then do similarly with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and bind the two veins with a moderate constriction, so that the sick person is not strangled. And leave it until morning. For the wound heals.
Concerning the phlebotomy of veins, Algeberich. Moreover, Algeberich's phlebotomy is helpful, because it contributes to canker in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those which are in the nose and in its circumference.
And the manner of their phlebotomy is that you make the infirm one sit before you, and bind his neck with a fillet. Then roll back his lip, and look at two veins: of which one is on the right of the lip, and the second on its left: and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of both. And this is true: because in their circumference are small, black veins. Therefore incise each with an incised incision.
But if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then attend to the incision of the larger of them, and the more manifest of them.
And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed custom runs very much with it: and incise the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue after phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein. Truly, the help of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is for suffocations which are in the throat, and illness of the uvula, and illnesses of the mouth.
And the manner of phlebotomizing them is that the infirm person should sit between your hands before the sun; and lift up his tongue, and look under the tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein; and the color of each inclines towards blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize both; and take care lest you wound your hand in phlebotomizing them. For arteries are beneath them, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries will happen.
Now the three veins which are phlebotomized in the elbow are those in whose phlebotomy custom runs in all men.
And phlebotomy of them is done according to two methods. Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome: or an olive-shaped one sloping to a point: or by cutting with a lancet phlebotome, and that is Alnesil. And this is its form.
And of them there are broad and fine types according to the size and narrowness of the veins. The form of the myrtle phlebotome is broad, as you see. And it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins, and those which contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of less breadth, and of finer point.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of fine veins which contain fine, yellow blood.
The basilica, however, which is one of these three veins, is an aid to phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from that which follows the chest and belly: and it befits the phlebotomist, when he phlebotomises it, that he be cautious, and be mindful of fear from it, for under it is an artery. If therefore he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will result. Therefore it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a pointed phlebotomy instrument; rather, let it be cut with an alnesil.
But if the basilica does not appear in manifest form, then it is necessary that you abandon it, and change to another, or seek some branch of it: or phlebotomize in its place the cord of the arm. For it is manifest, and cut it with an alnesil phlebotomy instrument, as we have said.
But if you wish the phlebotomy of that same vein, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the place, until you recognize the place of the pulse. Then mark the place with a cautery, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with an alnesil phlebotomy instrument, as we have said. And beware lest the incision fall through the space from the place of the artery.
And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place which you marked with the cautery, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
But if you see the blood at the phlebotomy leaping up, like a boy's urine, and it is thin blood, red: then know that it is from the blood of the artery. Then therefore hasten, and place your finger upon it for a long space, then remove your finger. If therefore the blood spurts (for it often spurts) then bind the arm, and release it: and let the patient beware of its movement: and let him be upon his guard against it.
And let him not move it for several days, until it is healed.
But if the blood does not spurt, and overcomes you: and you do not have medicine present at that moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you. For its extremities are contracted, and the blood spurts.
Or take the bark of a fig, and split it: take one half, and bind it over the place of the stricture of the vein decently, with a bandage and lint until the next day.
Then if the blood spurts, it is good. And if not: then treat it with that which has been previously mentioned from the place of powders that stop the flow of blood: and the cutting of its blood is not difficult in most situations, because of the smallness of the wound, and the possibility of bandaging from the arm.
Now the benefit of phlebotomy of the Median vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head, and the lower part of the body: therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the Basilic, and a branch of the Cephalic, as we have said.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomist that he be careful about its phlebotomy, for under it is a nerve. If therefore he adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, there happens in it numbness, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
And this nerve often appears to the sense. But if it is hidden in some men, and is subtle, and is not shown: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize, an incision with the Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
But if the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the Cephalic vein. Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to diseases of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by puncturing with an olive-shaped phlebotome, or with a myrtle-shaped phlebotome: because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor nerve.
However, it is fitting for you in phlebotomy, that you avoid with the phlebotome only the head of the biceps, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm it, if it is not found with the first puncture, that it is repeated upon it with phlebotomy several times.
However, perhaps it may suppurate in some men when it is not phlebotomized in the first puncture, but that suppuration does not harm it in any way.
Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it. Moreover, the quality of phlebotomy, and its consequences resulting from it, in whose rectification it behooves you to think.
First then, of that which it is necessary for you to know, is that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health, and its perseverance, and caution against the arrival of illnesses.
And that phlebotomy be done in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Median, and the Basilic. And that phlebotomy be performed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer; and in autumn and winter after a meal, when the signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomy however, which is administered in illnesses, does not have a determined time; but when expediency and necessity prompt it, at night or day, and at every hour, and at every time.
And it is not fitting that boys be bled until fourteen years have come upon them. Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth month up to the seventh. Nor should old men be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Therefore when anyone wishes to be bled for whatever reason: it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if much retained fecal matter is in them; so that the veins do not attract during phlebotomy from the bowels putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members.
Nor should a patient suffering from nausea, that is, a sickening fullness, be bled; nor one who is surfeited, nor one recovering from drunkenness, until that is removed from them. Nor one ill with dropsy.
And let phlebotomy be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and everything that weakens the bodily or animal strength.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him: or let him exercise in some way, so that the blood is thinned.
And place his phlebotomy in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we said: and try so that his chest is emptied that day of all bad animal accidents: such as anxiety, anger, and fear: and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, pain, excessive intercourse, and similar things.
And let there be present in his seat things with whose use the custom of men runs, from aromatics and fragrances, and dancing and things like that, as much as possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion which is higher than the cushion of the one being phlebotomized; afterwards let him draw out his arm, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice or thrice. Then let him tighten the ligature with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, because when the constriction is unequal, or excessive in constriction, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Then after the constriction it is necessary that the one being phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins swell and are revealed to the sense.
Then let the phlebotomist wipe the one to be phlebotomized with a little old oil, properly.
Then let him place the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself a little below the place where he wishes to phlebotomize, so that the vein does not slip away and the incision is spoiled. Because among the veins there is one which you find like a fleeing string during phlebotomy: and there is one which is full of wind: and when you place the phlebotomy instrument on it, it contracts under the instrument, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, it is narrow: therefore it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm, and be careful in all these matters.
Then let him put down the phlebotomy instrument. If therefore the vein opens at once, then it is good. And if not, then repeat it another time a little below that place, or above it quickly, if the place does not fester.
But if it festers, or the patient is frightened, then leave him for a day or two days: and do not tighten the ligature. For perhaps it will draw a hot abscess. Nor should he enter a bath.
Then let him repeat the phlebotomy, if he wishes.
But if the opening is small, or the blood flows weakly: and you fear that the quantity of blood you wish will not come out: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same opening lengthwise, and add a little to the operation.
And do this quickly, before the place becomes an abscess, for an abscessed place is in many men at a small operation.
Therefore if you see it already abscessed, then do not repeat upon it at all, for nothing excuses you. And place upon it something of the sediment of oil: because it alleviates the flow of blood. And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the sediment of oil in all your phlebotomy, which phlebotomizes veins against the prohibition of blood flow: and theriac alfarach and sagzenea do this, when one of them is placed upon the place.
For blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
But if a large abscess should occur at the place of phlebotomy, for this often happens, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except at that time, or the opening of the vein is small, then hasten and place upon the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly: and bind it for one hour: because it is resolved.
And it is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood from the vein itself, with the completion of it, or from another vein.
But if something of blackness or greenness remains in the place after some days, it does not harm: and if you wish, place upon it something of aloe or myrrh dissolved: or something of the juice of mint, that is, calamint or something similar to it.
And very often indeed abscesses and swellings occur near the phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
Place therefore your hand upon it, then if you find softness upon your compression upon it, then that swelling is bad. Beware therefore, that you place upon it something of that which we have said. For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with that in which there is stypticity, so that the place may be hardened. Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract from every man from the blood according to the quantity of his strength. And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it reddens: and similarly if you see it thick: then let it out until it is thinned: and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the vein’s phlebotomy be widened, and the phlebotomy be wide: and in him who is weak, it should be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary that he extract it in turns, and that the opening be narrow: and better than what is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the incision of the nerve: and it is more laudable, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
And for whom syncope is accustomed to arrive at phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy a little bread infused in pomegranate water: or secaniabin, if it is warmed: and extract from him blood in three times, or four.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread infused in syrup of mulberries, or in syrup of honey spiced with spices, or in fragrant spiced syrup.
But if syncope happens during phlebotomy, and its cause is the exit of much blood: then it is necessary that he take in drink meat water, and subtle fragrant syrup: and let him use aromatherapy with aloes wood, and let his chest be anointed with it: and let him use the other things which we said in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
He who wishes to evacuate his arm, and to release his blood secondly: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for much evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he release blood gradually according to the amount of his strength in continuous days.
But he who wishes to evacuate his arm, and to release his blood secondly, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven hours, or nine, from his first phlebotomy.
But he who wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite of the part to which it inclines: it is necessary that he be bled on the second day, or on the third.
But in whom there is much blood already heated, and sharpened, and causes fever to happen: it is necessary that blood go out from him at one time, and that a great quantity be drawn from him: and the opening be widened until syncope happens: after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy: and that you place your hand upon his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not happen in place of syncope. For often that happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant, and negligence falls.
And it is not necessary, when you wish to open the arm, and to release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that it be pressed upon forcefully, and bent and extended quickly. For that is very bad; indeed, leave it until it is bled a second time.
Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomy instrument that which is coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and put upon it something of salt dissolved in water. And put upon it something of theriac alfarob or sagapenum, and apply gentle compression until the blood flows out.
But if the vein is already abscessed, then leave it, and do not cover it, until the abscess settles.
But if necessity demands a second bloodletting, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize in the same place, or in another vein in the other arm.
Moreover, the cord of the arm is phlebotomized in the place of the Median and Basilic veins, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the manner of this phlebotomy is that the sick person should put his hand in warm water until it readily reddens and the vein clearly appears.
Then it should be bound above it with a ligature, with a moderate constriction. Then phlebotomize transversely little by little, neither laterally nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize slightly above the joint of the hand.
If the flow of blood is prevented, then put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood flow into the water, until you obtain what you need.
But if it is in the summer months, then you are excused from putting the hand back into warm water. And indeed, the letting of blood into warm water is mostly done in wintertime.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy of the Salvatella vein of the right hand, however, benefits liver diseases.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that you bind the little finger of the hand with a ligature, or with your hand, after you have put it in warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly seen. Then phlebotomize it transversely. And if you cut it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
And take care not to overextend your hand with the phlebotomy instrument. For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers bared of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it. For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and will be prevented from flowing.
Therefore, when you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not close quickly.
And similarly it is necessary that you do with every constricted branch.
Truly, the help of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it contributes to the illnesses of the spleen; and similarly do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
Moreover, the help of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for illnesses which are in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menses, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the infirm person puts his foot into warm water: and makes friction upon it, until the veins swell; and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap. And indeed the place of the vein is near the heel, appearing towards the great toe; and many branches ramify from it in the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its collection; because it is better and safer.
But if you phlebotomize it in the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves which are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy, by which you phlebotomize it, transversely, as if you wish to cut it; and let the phlebotomist be skillful.
But if the exit of blood is prevented, then immerse his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into it, until it is evacuated.
But if the phlebotomist misses the vein at the first attempt, then let him repeat with the phlebotomy a little higher, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic veins, as we said, is near the heel on the outer side.
And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for pain in the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of its phlebotomy is that the patient should enter a bath and hurry; and bind his leg from the side of the hip to above the heel with four fingers' breadth, with a long, thin band; for it does not appear otherwise.
When therefore it appears, then phlebotomize it according to whatever method is possible for you, or according to its course; and it is better, or to incise it with an incision, or to cut it with a section. For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most men.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in most men. But if you do not find it, and it does not appear to the sense at all: then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the dorsum of the foot, and towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood you wish flow.
Then loosen the binding, and place a leather over the place of phlebotomy, and bind the place. For it heals quickly.
Concerning cupping, and the quality of its use.
Cupping instruments are made from horns, and from air, and from glass.
And cupping is done in two ways. With scarification and extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods. Or it is with fire. Or it is without fire.
And there are fourteen places on the body for cupping which is administered with scarification and bloodletting. Of which one is, the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is the back of the head: and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck: and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are two plates of the neck on both sides together: and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades: and the cuppings of Alachosos above the end of the spine: and the cuppings of the two elbows, and they are the middle of the two arms: and the cuppings of the two thighs: and the cuppings of the two calves.
And cupping indeed does not draw blood from you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that strength does not fall from them, as is the case with phlebotomy. Nor is it necessary that cupping be administered either with fire or without fire in any illnesses which occur from repletion, until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity prompts cupping because of illness or habit, we administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Which is because there are men in whom blood multiplies until it needs to be extracted by cupping; they find heaviness and headache in their head.
And some of them find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. And some of them find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And some of them scratch the place of their cupping. And some of them laugh excessively. And some of them find the taste of blood in their mouth; or their tongue is ulcerated, and they spit blood. And some of them sleep excessively. And some of them see in their sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to them.
Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order venesection to be performed, after two or three hours of the day have passed.
Now, the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that it helps with heaviness in the head and that which is poured out into the eyes. But truly it is necessary that this be after evacuation of the whole body.
And indeed this cupping is in place of cephalic phlebotomy.
And it is not permitted that one who is of cold complexion, or in whom there is catarrh, use it. For it brings him great harm.
And because of that it is not necessary that the elderly use it, and those in whose head are cold illnesses.
But he who is assiduous over it, forgetfulness is generated upon him.
And because of that it is necessary that you instruct the cupper, that he put down his hand with the cupping glass a little to the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Cupping or Alkehel is in place of the median vein phlebotomy, and the basilic vein phlebotomy, and because of that it benefits asthma, and constriction of breath, and fissure of the instrument of breath, and cough, and repletion.
And it is necessary that the Alkehel cupping glass be applied lightly, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Cupping, however, alhagdahim, benefits pains occurring in the head, and ophthalmia, and hemicrania, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in place of the basilic vein phlebotomy.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper, lest he press his hand with the scarification: lest he cut an artery, and a flow of blood happen.
Cupping, however, under the chin, benefits canker sores in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar illnesses which are in the mouth: and it stands in place of the phlebotomy alieherich, which are in the two lips.
Cupping, however, of the shoulders, benefits alchafacham, which is produced from repletion and heat.
Cupping, however, of the inner parts of the two ankles, provides aid to the phlebotomy of the three veins, the Basilic, and the Median, and the Cephalic: because it itself draws blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh: and those small veins draw from other veins thicker than them, until the drawing reaches the three veins.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper, lest he proceed too far in scarification: because the place is denuded of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Cupping, however, which is cupped over the alchausos, benefits hemorrhoids of the anus, and lower ulcers.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper, that the cupping glass be large, and that it be of air: because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps thin cupping glasses break: and let it be scarified with a large scarification.
Cuppings, however, of the legs diminish with manifest diminution: because they draw blood from the whole body, and benefit old pains in the kidneys, and the womb, and the bladder: they provoke menstruation, and benefit boils, and ademenul: and they stand in place of the phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Nevertheless, they weaken the body much, and cause syncope to occur in many men.
And the benefit of cupping of the alhorcobeni is close to the benefit of cupping of the two legs.
The quality of the placement of cuppings is that you place the cupping glass first empty, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the placement of the cuppings, but place them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors may come to the place with equal arrival: and do not cease to iterate this and continue, until you see the place now redden and inflate, and the redness of blood appears: then therefore scarify, and iterate the suction gradually. Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
For whoever of men is of tender flesh, of sparse pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, not more: lest the place be ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to amplify the scarification, and deepen it a little: and moderate the suction in ease, and speed, and gentle movement.
But if there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarify him twice. In the first instance indeed a way is opened for the thinning of the blood, and its watery part: and in the second indeed for the thorough investigation of the extraction of thick blood.
If however the blood is very foul, then let a scarification be made a third time: that it may achieve the ultimate.
And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or little by little, one scarification suffices for us. But if we wish the extraction of much blood, we scarify with many scarifications.
And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification: and the equal limit in scarification, is the depth of the skin.
What is that which it is necessary to administer from oils at the placing of cupping glasses, and what the cupper should avoid.
Indeed in him whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are constricted, it is necessary that the places to be cupped be anointed with opening, softening, resolving oils: if it is in the time of summer, such as is oil of alkeiri, or oil of violets, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seed.
And if it is in the time of winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or sarbatine oil: and similar things.
If however the superfluity is thick, cold: then let the oil be marjoram oil, or costmary oil, or rue oil, or dill oil: and similar things.
If however the person to be cupped has large pores, tender flesh: then it is necessary that he be forbidden oil, and it is necessary that he wash the places of the cupping glasses after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with water of solanum, or with gourd water, or with purslane water: and things similar to them.
He however whose blood is of much humidity, let him wash the cuppings with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumach: and similar things.
But he whose superfluities are thick, let him wash his cuppings with old wine, or with water of wormwood, or a decoction of dill, or chamomile: and similar things.
And it is necessary that cupping be avoided in the bath, or immediately after the bath; indeed it is necessary that it be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
And it is not necessary that anyone sleep after cupping.
What is it by which it is necessary that the one to be cupped, or bled, be regulated before cupping?
And after it, it is necessary that you consider first: then if the cupped or bled one is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation prevail over his blood: then it is necessary that he take refrigerants, such as pomegranate: and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and succory, and julep: and similar things.
And put among his foods chickens, and the flesh of young sheep, and foods seasoned with verjuice: and similar things.
And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let him take moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new: and let him be ordered to use little food. And put among his food chickens, and canebir; and sparrows, that is, small birds; and young pigeons, he should eat.
And it is necessary that drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting be more than food: and it is necessary that in some men there be given in drink at certain hours theriac alfaroch, or a medicine of musk, that is, nutmeg, or alesselith before cupping: and before bloodletting, or after: so that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood thinned. And it is not necessary that they take it in heated drink.
Concerning cupping without scarification. Cuppings, however, which are without scarification, are cuppings which are placed upon the liver, and spleen, and gout, and upon the belly, navel, and the regions of the kidneys, and the hip joint: because these members do not endure scarification upon them.
And nothing is sought by them, except either the drawing of blood from a member to a member: just as we place a cupping glass upon the breasts in the illness of nosebleed. And we use them to resolve from a member cold, trapped flatulence in a member: just as we place a cupping glass upon the belly and navel. For it itself rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes pain, therefore, because it resolves that flatulence.
Also it is placed upon the kidneys, when there happens in them obstruction, or a stone. For by the virtue of its attraction perhaps it opens the obstruction, or removes the stone from its place.
And similarly it acts when it is placed upon the liver and spleen with rubbing flatulence in both of them.
And these cupping glasses are administered empty with only incision. And sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in illnesses of pleurisy: and that is so that the cupping glass is filled, and is large, with warm water alone, or water in which herbs that are suitable have been decocted.
The form of a cupping glass administered with fire.
Let the size of its opening be two open fingers, according to what we have formed: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be in its side, in the place which is about its middle, a small hole, according to the quantity that a needle enters it: let it be made of bronze, or brass, of thick edges, smooth, even, firm: so that it does not injure the limb at its placement upon it: and let there be in its middle a transverse rod of bronze, or iron, where a candle with fire is placed.
And now this cupping glass is made large, larger than that which we have described, and a little smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
For the cupping glasses of children and thin people are different from the cupping glasses of men and those of thick bodies.
The method of placing this cupping glass with fire on a limb is to light a small linen wick with fire decently, or a small wax candle: and place it on the middle of the transverse rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass: so that the lit fire is around the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the body of the sick person is not burned.
Then let it be placed on the limb: and a finger should be placed over the hole which I mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glass; when we need it, we remove the finger, and the vapor will come out through that hole, and the cupping glass will be removed immediately.
Then relight the wick in its own way, and repeat it, if you need it.
In the cupping glass however which is administered in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod, nor hole: and it is not administered, except that it is filled with water, and placed on the limb only.
And this is its form.
And this cupping glass, the larger it is, so that it may hold much water, is better.
Concerning the application of leeches.
Leeches are not applied in many places, except in those members where the application of cupping glasses is not possible, because of their smallness, such as the lip and the gums, and similar things. Or in a member denuded of flesh, such as a finger, and nose, and similar things.
And the manner of using them is: that you take leeches which are in fresh waters, clean from putrefaction.
Then let them be left day and night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies. Then let the body be evacuated first with phlebotomy, and with cupping glasses. Then wipe the member of the sick person until it is red. Afterwards, let them be placed upon it.
Therefore, when they are full and fall, and suction of the place with a cupping glass is possible, then it is most effective in helping; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar. Then with much water, and let it be rubbed, and squeezed out.
But if the flow of blood is prolonged after the fall of the leeches, and it is oozing: then dip a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the oozing is stopped.
But if the blood increases, then powder on it crushed alum, or galls, and similar things from the styptics: until the blood is stopped.
Or let the halves of shelled beans be placed on the place: and let them remain, until the beans adhere to the place, for the blood is stopped.
And it is necessary, if a repetition of leeches is necessary, to change them when possible.
But if leeches are prevented from adhering, then let the place be wiped with fresh blood. Or prick the places with a needle, until something of the blood comes out. Then let them be applied, for when they sense something of the blood, they adhere immediately.
Therefore, when you wish them to fall off, sprinkle on them something of powdered aloe, or salt, or ashes: and they will fall off immediately.
This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Know, O sons, that foolish doctors and laymen boast of this chapter, who have never inspected the books of the ancients, nor read a letter from them.
And for this reason it happens that this method is unknown in our land. And I never encountered anything good in it, and I did not obtain from it what I obtained except through long reading of the books of the ancients, and study to understand them, until I extracted knowledge of it from them.
Then I adhered to experiment and study for the length of my life.
And now I have described to you from it in this chapter all that my knowledge contains: and what my experiment has shown, after I have shortened it for you, and freed it from the burden of prolixity, and abbreviated it with a fine abbreviation, and shown it with a fine exposition: and I have formed in it many forms of the instruments which are used in it, since it is an addition to the exposition, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter II.
It is necessary that we should say, in the prologue of this chapter, the summaries of the discourse, and the chapters, the understanding of which is necessary for the craftsman firstly, in order to stand upon their truth: namely, that you and those who are ready may know, or learn, this noble art, and others from you.
I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or sprain, or fall happens to someone, then it is necessary that you hasten first to bleed him, and to purge him, or both together: unless something forbids it, such as weakness of strength; or if the one to whom one of these things has happened is a child, or a decrepit old man; or if it is a time of intense heat, or of intense cold.
Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, and the flesh of birds and kids; and forbid wine, and thick meats, and being filled with foods and every food which fills the veins with blood. Until, when you are secure from a hot abscess, and do not fear an effusion of matter to the limb: then let the infirm return to his first regime, with which his custom ran.
When therefore a broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the infirm be nourished with foods nourishing with much, thick, heavy nourishment, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from boiled wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish; and thick wine, and things similar to them. For with this regime the coagulation of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in early old age, and decrepit, it is not possible that they are joined and consolidated according to their nature always, because of the dryness of their limbs; and those which are in the end of softness are consolidated and joined, like the bones of small children.
Nevertheless nature attaches to a broken bone on every side something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds it, until they are glued together, and bound together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its operations: and because of this cause it is necessary that you put in the nourishment of the infirm foods in which there are heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
And know that the kinds of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs: because a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head: and a fracture of the bone of the chest is different from a fracture of the bone of the back: and similarly all the other limbs are all different from one another: and I have come with a remembrance of every kind of fracture expounded in its Chapter, distinct from another. And the kinds of bone fracture are also diversified in themselves.
Because its fracture is curved, besides which splinters occur in it. And sometimes its fracture is according to the length of the bone: and its fractures are splinters, that is, splinters, and additions proceeding, such as are in a reed, when it is fitted with a knife for writing. And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and there is a fracture with a small fissure.
And each kind has its own method, or instrument, in its restoration, according to what its remembrance will come, distinct in its places.
And from that by which a bone fracture is known, is its tortuosity, and its prominence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
When therefore there is no apparent tortuosity in the place, nor sound on your touch when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the infirm find great pain: then there is no fracture there, indeed it is possible that there is tortuosity, or a small fissure: therefore it is not necessary that you move it with your hand and compression completely, indeed place on it of the medicines, of which remembrance comes, after that moment which is suitable for the place: then let it be bound with a thin bandage.
And know that when a place is arched, and split in two, besides what happens in it of injuries, nevertheless every part is removed from its equal: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to its rectification, equalizing it before a warm abscess happens to it.
But if a warm abscess happens to it, then leave it for some days, until the abscess rests. Then equalize it according to whichever way can be done with gentleness and skill.
And know that its restoration, and its equalization, is easier than that of a bone in which injuries occur.
Then bind it, according to what will come to your mind concerning it.
But if there are injuries in the bone, then extension of this broken member from two parts is necessary, if it is a hand or foot; or with your hand, if the member is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
And let your position, in which you place the member, be on an even place, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try to make those additions return in every way, and according to whichever way you can, to their places; and beware, according to your strength, lest pain or injury happen to the patient through your operation; and try, according to your strength, to apply one of the two bones to its fellow, according to the best methods.
And it is necessary at that time that you try and touch it with your hand. If therefore you see something different there, correct it and equalize it according to the measure of your strength.
And beware of vehement extension and strong compression, as many foolish men do. For very often they cause by that operation of theirs a hot abscess, or a contraction in the member: as we have already seen that from their operations very often.
Then, after the equalization and proper operation and the binding of that member, and rest, and tranquility,  advise the patient about it. And make him beware lest he move it at the time of his waking, and his sleep, in its revolution and agitation, and in his excretion, and all his movements with his utmost strength. And that he beware lest the position of the member be a position which causes pain. That is, because when he feels pain or injury in the positioning of the member, then it is necessary that you change it to another position from that with which he does not feel pain.
And be careful with it, that its position be equal and straight, so that tortuosity does not occur in the member when it is restored.
And the quality of the binding of the broken member is as I relate.
Know that broken members are diversified in their smallness and their size and their shape.
Therefore, those of them which are small, such as the arm and finger and the radius and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth. But those of them which are thick, such as the hip and leg, it is necessary that there be in them a wide, hard wrapping.
Because a wide ligature connects a large member and binds it from every part with an equal binding, so that no blemish enters it.
Then begin after your evacuation to place a suitable liniment to it, on soft lint over the place of its fracture. Then begin to wrap the ligature over the place of its fracture with three or four wrappings, according to what the member deserves: and tighten your hand a little with the ligature.
Then go with it to the upper part from the place of the fracture, and tighten less than was your binding, with which you bound the broken place. Then lengthen yourself with the wrapping from the place of the fracture a little, and soften the binding gradually, until you take from the healthy place a large amount.
Then take another bandage, and wrap it again over the broken place with wrappings. Afterwards go with the wrapping to the lower part from the fracture. And let your work be in the tightening of the wrapping, and the softening of it, according to what we said in the first upper wrapping.
Then place between the wrappings some soft tow, or cloth, with which the crookedness of the fracture is evened out, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Then wrap another bandage over it. Afterwards evenly place over these bandages properly made splints immediately, if there is not swelling in the place, nor a hot abscess.
But if there is swelling or an abscess in it, then place on it that which sits upon that abscess, and removes the swelling; and leave it for a few days. Then bind the splints over it.
And let the splints be from the halves of broad reeds, shaved, skillfully shaped; or let them be from the wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or gerard, that is, palm branches, or calingi; and let the size of each splint be according to this form, and this same figure.
However, it is necessary that the splint which is placed over the injured part be somewhat thicker and broader than the other splints; and the length of the splint should be according to what is permitted by the limb in size and smallness.
Then bind over the splints with another bandage, according to the same first binding. Then bind over it neatly with threads, as we said about the binding: and it is so that your binding over the place of the fracture should be tighter; and the further it extends from the fracture, the looser the binding.
And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and fineness, and be of soft linen.
Because if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the practice of foolish men placing their threads from twisted linen cords, it is a great mistake; because the binding falls with them outside the proper quality.
And thin threads again are not suitable; because you will not achieve with them through the binding that which you wish.
And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger between splint and splint.
But if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after binding in healthy places, then place under them some soft tow or carded wool, until nothing is injured thereby.
When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and a rupture occurs in the skin, I will deal with its treatment in a separate chapter.
And know that not every broken limb needs to be bound with splints from the first day. That is because, when a limb is large, it is not necessary to put splints on it until after five days, or seven, or more, according to your assurance from the outcome of hot inflammation.
And this is the method of the plasters which the ancients used, which are applied to fractures and dislocations.
The method of a common abbreviated plaster, restoring fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children: because it is made of something which neither heat nor cold overcomes.
And it is that you take from the dust of the mill, and it is the flour bran which hangs on the walls of the mill at the movement of the millstone: and make it as it is, except that you sift it with egg white: and make its consistency neither thick nor thin. Then use it.
The method of another plaster, restoring fracture, and dislocation, and torsion. Take alkanet, and laudanum, and acacia, and elecampane, and gum arabic: and the juice of all, of each ten drachms, of myrrh, and aloes of each five drachms, and litharge twenty drachms; let all be ground, and sifted, and mixed with litharge water: or with egg white, if the complexion of the patient is heated. Then use this plaster. For it is of good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many men.
The method of another plaster, which also benefits fracture and torsion. Take gum arabic, and alkanet, and marshmallow, of each ten drachms, of myrrh, and aloes of each five drachms, of acacia six drachms, of Armenian bole twenty drachms; let all be ground with much grinding, and sifted, and made up with water, or egg white: and let it be administered.
The method of a plaster for joints, and bones separated from their places: and it soothes the pain occurring to them, and the fissure of a bone, and fracture. Let greasy wool be taken, and submerged in vinegar, and boiled oil: and let it be placed upon the place.
And indeed in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good in the soothing of a hot abscess: and it expels pains properly.
The method of a plaster which restores a broken bone. Take leaves of the wild fig, and leaves of wild poppy: and grind everything, and make a plaster from both.
The method of an abbreviated plaster, administered in the restoration of a bone fracture: and when you wish the resolution of the remaining abscess. Take of marshmallow root, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and herb flour, of each one part: let all be ground, and made into a paste with wine, if the limb is not heated.
But if it is heated, then prepare it with the water of moist coriander, or with water, and use it.
The method of another stronger plaster in resolution than the first, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of a limb. Take of marshmallow root, and linseed, and balaustium, and melilot, and bugloss, and violet flower, and chamomile, of each one part; let all be ground, and made into a paste with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine. All this according to the warmth of the limb, and the abatement of its heat.
Hippocrates however did not say in his book that anything should be put on a broken limb during its restoration except cerate made from wax and oil: nothing else: and he related that it should be medium between thickness and thinness.
To Galen however it seemed good that things which possess a drying warmth should be placed on a broken limb during its restoration, such as myrrh, and aloes and frankincense, and similar things to them from those which we have related.
Method of a plaster which helps with injury and pain. Take mugath, and chickpea, and cut human hair, or bird feather, and marshmallow, and salt in equal parts: let them be ground, and sifted, and mixed: and let a plaster be made from it.
The amount of time for which the bandage ought to remain, then be untied, is that you should consider then, if no pain happens to the patient, nor itching, nor is the broken bone moved from its place: then do not untie it for many days. But if intense itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling happens to him in the place: then hasten, and untie it at once, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, moistened: and immerse it in warm water, and wash the place with it, until the itching ceases, and the pain subsides.
But if intense itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling happens to him in the place: then hasten, and untie it at once, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, moistened: and immerse it in warm water, and wash the place with it, until the itching ceases, and the pain subsides. Then let the limb rest for an hour. Then place upon it carded wool, immersed in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it on for one night, until you are secure from a hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed.
Then return it to a thin bandage, and a small plaster: and do not bind it with your first constriction, and do this carefully with it, until it is healed.
But if you see that the abscess, and redness, and pain, and swelling, and all the symptoms are now completely removed, and you need a plaster and bandage, then repeat it as you did at first equally.
But if nothing of what we have said happens to the limb, then do not unbind it except after three days, or four, or five, or seven. And when twenty days have passed, all of that, according to what appears to you from the loosening of the limb, as we have said, until when the fracture adheres, and the coagulation of flesh approximates it: then also add to the bandage more than your whole first bandage: and also add to the thickening of the patient's food, according to what the previous recollection of it has been.
But if you see the place of the fracture drying out and becoming thinner than it ought, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it. Therefore bathe it with warm water at every time that you unbind it, and let this be for three days, and loosen the bandage a little.
Through this operation, therefore, nourishment flows to the limb, and it heals quickly.
But what foolish restorers of a limb fracture do in another way, when it is not restored at first as it ought, and is restored according to crookedness, is an error of their operation, and great fear: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said it in their books, and would have operated with it.
And I have nowhere seen any trace of them at all in it, and it is better that it not be done.
Concerning an accidental injury to the head.
The kinds of fracture are diverse, and its forms are many: and its causes are distinct.
For there is a fracture which is made by a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the bone entirely until it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood: and on account of this, this kind of fracture is called Axial.
Or a sword cuts some of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the incision does not penetrate to its end: and this kind of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, Elevation absolutely.
And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
And there is a fracture which is a contusion, or attrition: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall upon a stone, or similar things.
And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the membrane which is under the bone: or it is in the surface of the bone: and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone in the fineness of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and because of that this kind of fracture is called Capillary.
And among them is a fracture which is made by a fall, or a blow from a stone, and similar things, which cause a plate of bone to enter inwards, and a concavity is made in the place: just as happens to bronze cauldrons, when a blow strikes them, and part of them enters inwards.
And this happens most in the heads of moist bones, such as are the heads of children.
And for all these kinds of fractures separate treatments are made, and I will come to the recollection of all of that in its place.
And we recognize all these kinds of fractures by examining them, and investigating them with probes, and removing the corrupted flesh which is upon them.
The hair-line fracture however is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, and cleaned, and smeared with a hot iron: for the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the patient's symptoms: then if you see from the symptoms that it signifies manifestly danger, such as vomiting of bile, and extension, and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and protrusion of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar symptoms in many conditions, undoubtedly it is not curable: and if you see symptoms not frightening you, and you hope for recovery: then begin its treatment.
That is, if a wounded man comes to you immediately after being wounded: and it is in the winter months, then it is necessary that you strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day according to every condition.
And if it is in the summer months, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the membrane is corrupted, and those symptoms which we have described occur.
But if the fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and is with small pieces, and attraction: then it is necessary that you cut away the broken and abraded part, according to what I tell you.
And it is necessary to shave the head of the wounded man: and expose the bone in whatever way is possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light upon the patient.
But if during the uncovering of the bone there occurs a flow of blood, or a hot abscess: then apply to it what is necessary. And it is necessary to fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil: and to make the wound rest, until the abscess subsides, and you are secure from the flow of blood. Then begin the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
And that is done according to one of two methods.
One method is to incise the bone with a sharp-edged incisor: and this is its form.
Then apply another, slightly wider, incisor after the first: and this is its form.
Then apply yet another incisor, wider even than the second.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisors: some of which are wider than others, and some shorter than others: and let them be very sharp at their ends, and let them be made of good iron or steel: and use care in striking the incisor, so that you do not shake the head and injure it.
But if the bone is strong and hard, then it is necessary to perforate its circumference before you apply the incisors, with drills which are called non-penetrating drills: and they are so called because they do not pass through the bony limit to that which is beyond it: because the drill has a round end above that which is under its sharp head, similar to a margin, and a small circle prevents it from sinking and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
And it is fitting for you to take many of these drills, each suited to the thickness of the bone, until you have a drill for every skull: the length and shortness of whose sharp end is according to the thickness of that skull.
And this is the form of three kinds of drills, or trepans.
The method of perforating the circumference of the fractured bone is: to place the drill on the bone, and to turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then change the drill to another place, and place what is between each hole at the thickness of a finger, or thereabouts.
Then incise with incisors what is between each hole in the bone: and make it as thin as you can from the end lightly, as we said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand, or with some other of certain instruments which you have prepared for it: such as forceps and fine scissors.
And it is necessary that you take every precaution lest the drill or incisor touch anything of the dura mater.
Therefore, when you have gone around the bone by perforating, and it has been separated from the dura mater, if it was continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary to shave and smooth the end of what remains in the bone with another instrument similar to an incisor. However, it is necessary that it be thinner and finer than other incisors.
But if something remains of small bones and splinters, then take them away easily with what is at hand among your instruments. Then treat the wound afterwards with linen and ointments as we have said.
And another method of operation is easy, altogether free from fear: which Galen mentioned and praised greatly; and this is his statement. It is necessary for you first to begin to uncover the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more severe and more evident, until when you have uncovered that part, and you have placed under it the end of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the form.
And the lenticular part, being smooth, does not cut anything; and its sharp part on its two sides going lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests against the soft tissue, its sharp side falling on the bone.
Then strike the incisor on one side with a small hammer, until you cut through the whole bone easily, as if it were being rolled; and you will be safe from the membrane, so that nothing happens to it which you fear at all.
And if the physician were not the most foolish of men, and most ignorant of this, nor were sleeping, then if something of the membrane remained attached to the bone in some places, he would cut it from it with the end of his lenticular incisor, and would free it from it easily. For it is freed from it without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the membrane, and what is cut away from the bone is its surface, and roughness and small splinters remain on it: then it is necessary that you scrape that roughness, and remove those splinters with fine rasps, of which you have prepared a number of different sizes, so that it is possible for you to use from them in every place the most suitable and most straight of them, according to that to which the operation leads you, and the fractured bone, and its shape. And it is necessary that you use in your procedure, in which you first scrape the bone, the wider of those rasps. Then use after it a finer one.
And it is necessary that you use in your procedure, in which you first scrape the bone, the wider of those rasps. Then use after it a finer one. And do not cease to do that continuously, until you arrive at using the finest and most delicate of them all.
In each of the remaining small, hair-like fissures and delicate fractures, it is necessary that you administer care, according to that which leads to its straightening.
And it is a thing which is not hidden from anyone who has any study in this art, and has considered what we have written and shown in large fractures.
But if the exposed membrane remains when you remove the bone, then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound. Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do this as easily as you can so that the intestine is not burdened.
Then apply a wide bandage over it; and do not bind it tightly except to the extent that it holds the wound only: and leave it with this dressing for one day or two days, until you are secure from a hot abscess. Then unbind it, and afterwards apply medicines with which there is superfluous dryness: such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and birthwort, and similar things: and it is to make a powder from these medicines, which is to be sprinkled over the wound as they are dry.
And universally apply to it any medicine whose property is to cleanse and not to bite. And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment is clean: nor is there any dirt of ointment, nor filthiness in it.
And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment is clean: nor is there any dirt of ointment, nor filthiness in it. Nor allow pus to collect in it at all: because when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and great harm happens to the patient afterwards: and it already happens in the inflammation of the head, when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when its care is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Consider therefore then, if the accidents which we have mentioned happen to the patient, know that it is undoubtedly very harmful.
And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine which is placed upon it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine to make that blackness: then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and apply a cloth with them. Then place it over the inflammation; afterwards treat it with the kinds of treatment which are suitable, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that only the two upper parts of the nose are broken together, or one of them; because these are two bones: for its lower part is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and there only occurs to it attrition, and crookedness, and flatness.
If one of the two parts of it is broken, then it is necessary that you insert the little finger into the hole of the nose, and set that fracture with your index finger and thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural form; and let this be done skillfully and easily. And beware that no pain occurs to the patient through your operation.
But if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger does not reach it, then it is necessary that it be set with the end of a radius, in which there is a small thickness.
If however the fracture is in two parts, then do similarly; and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible. And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the rest of the warm abscess.
Then insert into the end of the nose a linen pledget, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two pledgets if the fracture is in two parts; and let the thickness of the pledget be of such a quantity that it fills the hole of the nose.
And some of the ancient restorers said that the pledgets should be soaked in butter, and changed every day. That however does not seem good to me; indeed it is necessary that the pledget be soaked in egg white, mixed with mill dust. Then leave the pledget until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens.
And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of a pledget, after it has been wrapped in soft cloth; and it happens that this holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and that the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this is not a necessary thing. If you wish, do that; and if you wish, do the pledgets.
But if a hot abscess should occur again in the nose while you are operating, plaster the nose with cerate, or with cotton infused in rose oil, or a little diachylon.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary that you plaster it with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white. Then place a soft pledget over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
But if the bones of the nose are broken by a small fracture, or are comminuted, then it is necessary that you incise over them and extract them with instruments that are suitable for them. Then sew the incision, and treat it with what produces granulation and consolidation from suitable plasters or ointments.
But if a wound occurs between the nostrils, then it is necessary that you treat it with linen strips and insert a lead cannula until it heals.
Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then observe if the fracture is only external, and it is not broken in two, and is bent inwards; then its recognition is easy.
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand; and with it gently push the inward bulge of the fracture outwards with your other hand from the outside of the bone decently, and with it level it.
But if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary to administer extension from two parts, according to straightness, until its equalization is possible.
But if shaking or disruption has already occurred in the teeth, then bind those which you hope will remain with a gold or silver wire, or bristle. Then place cerate over the broken jaw. Then place a doubled cloth over it, and place a large, properly made splint over the cloth; or a piece of sole leather, equal in length to the jaw.
Then bind it from above, according to the way its bandage is prepared and its application is suitable, until it is not destroyed; and instruct the patient to use tranquility and quiet; and give him his food in gentle sorbtions.
But if you estimate that something of the form is already altered in some way, then hasten and unbind it on the third day. Then rectify what is altered from it, and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the cerate; and place soft wool over the plaster.
While therefore that plaster remains attached to it, and the arrangement of the bone is not altered, leave it, lest you unbind it, until it is healed; or bind the fracture. For often this fracture is bound in three weeks.
But if a hot abscess should occur meanwhile, then administer what we have often said in its sedation, until that abscess is removed.
And if the fracture is with a wound, consider. For if a fragment is now separated from the bone, or from the splinter: then be skillful in this, so that you remove those splinters of the splinter with what suits you in their removal from among the instruments.
But if the opening of the wound is narrow, then enlarge it with a fleam according to the amount of your need.
Then when you have removed those splinters, and nothing of them remains, sew then the opening of the wound, if it is large; and if not, place upon it of the plasters which are suitable for it, and they will cause it to grow flesh, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the collarbone, when it is broken.
The collarbone is indeed very often broken on the front side, on the shoulder side, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
For it is either broken and separated into two, except that splinters occur in it: and it is easier to restore it.
Or so that splinters occur in the bone: and it is more difficult to restore.
Or so that there is a fracture with a wound.
And the operation when the fracture is without a wound is that you cause two assistants to be present, so that one of them holds the aid that follows the broken collarbone, and the other extends the neck toward the side.
Then equalize the fracture with your fingers, until its form is made, according to what is necessary; and let there be neither prominence nor concavity in it.
But if you need more extension, then it is necessary that you place under the patient's neck a sphere of cloth or wool: and let its size be according to the quantity of your need: and extend and raise the collarbone, and compress the sphere with your hand, until you equalize the fracture, according to what is necessary.
But if you cannot pull the end of the collarbone outwards because it has reached a depth, then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back on his neck: and you place under his shoulder a pillow medium in size, and the assistant presses his shoulder downwards, until the bone of the collarbone which is deep is raised upwards: and then rectify the fracture, and equalize it with your fingers.
But if you feel a splinter from the collarbone, and it moves, then it is necessary that you incise over it, and extract the splinter easily.
But if it is retained in the bone, then make an incision in it with one of the scalpels which you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the collarbone the instrument which preserves the pleura: and this instrument is of wood or of iron. And this is its form.
It is similar to a spoon which has no concavity.
And let its width be according to that which you need of it from the size of the bone, and its smallness. Its length however also according to what is possible for you for the operation.
And let it have two extremities, as you see: and let one extremity be wide, and the other narrow.
But if the disruption of the wound which you cut when you extracted the splinter of bone, is wide, and you are secure from a hot abscess: then join the two lips of the wound with suture.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths, and powders according to the size of the wound's fissure.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then dip a cloth in rose oil, and vinegar, and wine, and place it on top.
A constriction however of the bone when it is without a wound, and without a section, is that you place on the bone a plaster made from mill flour with egg white. And place a soft pledget on top of it. Then place a sphere under its tickling, if you need that. Then take a himematem, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long: and let its width be one palm, or about that. Then place a doubled pad over the pledget and plaster. Then take a small splint from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and in length similarly. Then wrap it in cloth. Then wrap that cloth with the splint in the place of the alhimemati which falls upon the fracture and the place. Then place the alhimemati over the fracture as it is rolled, and wrap it over its neck, and under its healthy little finger, and under its unhealthy little finger: and bring it over every part, and as you see that the bandage holds the fracture with a decent bandage: and it is that which is not hidden from you, and the whole, so that the splint is not removed from above the broken bone. And because of this it is necessary that you look at the patient every day. Whenever therefore the bandage softens, and you see the splint being removed: then straighten it, and tighten the bandage.
Then place the patient's bed on his back, and place under his little finger at his bed a small cushion at night, so that with it his arm may be raised from his side. Therefore the fracture of the clavicle is elevated by the elevation of the shoulder.
Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not unbind the bandage, if no accident happens in the place from itching, or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Then renew the plaster, if you see its surface sticking to it. And add to the constriction, and leave it until it is restored and coagulated.
And indeed the fracture of the clavicle is constricted and strengthened mostly within twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in some men in less time than that.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the scapula.
The scapula is rarely fractured, and in its broad part; and only its margins are fractured from it.
Therefore when a place is fractured from it, and it is fractured in its middle, and this is not known except by touch: then according to what the figure of the fracture is, attempt its preparation. And restore it to its natural form in every way possible to your skill.
Then place upon the place mill dust with egg white, and soft lint, and place on top a small cushion of doubled cloth. Then place upon it a broad splint of thin wood according to the quantity of the whole scapula, or a little larger than it.
But if under the splint there is a concavity in any place of the scapula, then equalize that concavity with soft lint, until the splint descends according to evenness.
Then bind it above with a long bandage, with fitting constriction, and firmness of the splint, until it is not removed from its place.
And examine the bandage every day. Whenever, therefore, the bandage is loosened, tighten it, and equalize the splint if it is removed from its place: and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And indeed, the shoulder blade is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
When therefore this number is completed, then unbind the bandage: and you shall be in safety. For it is of bones whose consolidation is not feared, nor their separation.
But if a fragment of bone protrudes and pricks beneath the skin: then incise over it, and remove it. And do what we said in the fracture of the clavicle from the settling of a hot abscess, if anything should happen from it.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the breastbone.
The breastbone is sometimes fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens. Its extremities, however, are most often fractured and comminuted from accidents to it.
When its middle, which inclines towards the lower parts, is fractured, and there is intense pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps he vomits blood, and a concavity in the fractured bone is evident and not hidden from perception, its restoration is that the patient is laid supine on his back; and a cushion is placed between his shoulder blades.
Then press his shoulders, and bring together the ribs from both sides or flanks with the hands; and carefully adjust its alignment, in every way that is possible and appropriate, until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be.
Then place a plaster and lint over it, and place on top a splint of thin willow or alder board, or similar light materials, after you have wrapped it in cloth. Then carefully bind it over the fractured bone so that it does not move; and continue the bandage around the back several times, and tighten it with a suitable constriction.
Then examine the bandage every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it; and if necessity demands its loosening because of itching, or ulceration occurring at the site, or pain, or abscess: then hasten, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has occurred according to the method of its treatment.
Then replace the plaster, if you see it is needed; and apply a bandage to it until it heals.
Concerning the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the thick parts which follow the back, and at their extremities on the anterior side. And attrition does not happen to them except because they are cartilaginous. And its knowledge is not hidden from the sense upon examination with the fingers.
And its restoration is done in such a way that you equalize the fracture with the fingers as much as possible, until the shape is equalized, as is necessary. Then apply plasters, and bind the broken bone with a splint, if it needs it.
And if the fracture of the ribs is sloping inwards: then intense pain and a puncture happen to the patient, like the puncture which happens to someone who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane, and also difficulty of breathing, and coughing, and vomiting much blood happen to him: and this is difficult to cure.
And the ancients have devised many methods for it: and some of them say that you should give the patient foods which produce inflammation and flatulence, so that the abdomen is inflamed and distended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
We however avoid causing a rapid formation of a hot abscess, if it does not occur. But if it has already occurred, then add to it.
And some of them said: let a cupping glass be placed on the place, then let it be sucked with force, and this is more reasonable. Nevertheless, it is feared that the cupping glass will attract superfluities to the place, because of the weakened condition.
And some of them said: it is necessary that the place be covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil: and let powders be placed between the ribs, until it is filled: so that the bandage is even when you wrap it according to its roundness.
Then let the sick person be treated with a treatment for pleurisy from food and medicine.
But if a severe matter constricts the sick person, which he cannot tolerate, and the bone pierces the covering with a wounding puncture, and we fear for the sick person: then it is necessary that we cut over the place, and uncover the fractured rib. Then let us place over it the instrument which preserves the sifac, the remembrance of which preceded: and let us cut the bone easily, and let us incise it.
Then let us bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture: and let us treat it with plasters until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess should occur in the meantime, then hasten, and pour lint into rose oil, and place it over the place: and let the sick person be treated with what is suitable for the abscess.
Meanwhile also, let him lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Fracture sometimes occurs to the bones of the neck, and attrition rarely happens to them; and similarly also to the vertebrae of the back. Therefore when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether he will be healed or not, then consider. For if you see his hands already softened and numb and dead, and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor clench them; and when you clench them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that he will not be healed, and in most instances it is mortal.
But if he moves them, and feels constriction with the fingers and the prick: then know that the neck bone is safe, and that the sick man will be healed with treatment.
But if something similar to that happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether he will be healed or not: then consider his feet; then if you see that they are softened, and that which happened in the hands happens in them: then when he lies on his back, flatulence and excretion exit involuntarily; and when he is laid on his belly, excretion exits involuntarily; and when he is laid on his back, and wishes to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is mortal. Therefore do not labor in his cure.
If, however, nothing of that happens to him, the matter is less serious.
And the treatment of that which happens from it is that you try to soothe the hot abscess: so that you put on the affected vertebra rose oil alone; or with roasted egg yolks.
Apply this several times a day until the hot abscess is soothed; then apply to the place one of the strengthening, drying plasters, and bind it tightly; and instruct the patient to use rest and quiet. Nor should he sleep on the side where he finds pain, until it is healed.
But if it happens at the abrasion of a bone that is decayed, or something that is already separated from it: then it is necessary that you incise the skin, and remove it. Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture. Then treat it with some incarnative ointment until it heals.
If however the end of the alhausos bone is broken, and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary that you insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and set the broken bone with the other hand, as much as possible, and by a second setting.
Then place it on and remove it: and treat the wound with the treatment which preceded, until it heals.
Concerning the restoration of the hip.
Chapter XI.
Rarely are the bones of the hip broken. But if they are broken, then their fracture is only a comminution at their extremities: and they are split lengthwise, and deviate inwards: and there happens to the patient pain in the place, and a puncture: and the leg which is broken becomes numb.
And its restoration indeed is, that you extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture as is its form.
But if the fracture is only at its extremities, then set that fracture, according to what is prepared for you of a setting, until it is assimilated to its natural form.
If however the fracture is lengthwise, or it already deviates inwards: then make the patient lie on his belly, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. When therefore you have set it, place a plaster over it: then place over it a splint of wood, or of leather: and bind it tightly, over which you do not fear a change of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
And equalize the concavity of those with that which fills it, until the binding encompasses it according to equality: and instruct the patient to sleep on his back, or on his sound side.
But if a hot abscess should occur to him, then cease from its extension and its restoration, until the hot abscess subsides: and place upon it that which subsides it, according to what preceded, then return to its restoration: and bind it as is necessary.
If however it happens in a projecting bone, or is crushed, remove it.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the collarbone.
The collarbone is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder blade.
If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form which follows.
And two bandages will be tied at the two ends.
Then let it be hung from a high place: and let the patient sit on a seat. Then let him throw his broken arm onto the wood, until it reaches his armpit, in the middle of which the curve of the wood is attached.
Then hang something heavy above it, so that the assistant may extend it downwards. Then let the physician equalize the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns, as it ought.
And another method is, that the patient be laid supine upon his neck: and suspend his hand from his neck with a ligature. Then instruct two assistants, that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other hold that which is below it, and that each of them extend to his part.
And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind below the fracture with a ligature, and above it with another ligature: and let each of the two assistants extend to his own two parts.
If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it is necessary that one ligature be placed under the armpit, and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a ligature be placed above that place, and above the elbow itself.
Then set the fracture easily without effort, until when the fracture is set as it should be, and a good application is applied: then bind it, if a hot abscess does not occur.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave off the binding until the seventh day. And place upon it cut wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess is quiet: then bind it: and the method of binding it is to place a plaster over the fracture.
Then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster. Then let him support the arm on a support, and place his open hand on his shoulder.
And place a cloth and bind the arm to the support, so that the arm stands in the place of the stars: if nothing prevents you from it, nor is anything changed in you from the broken bone.
But if you fear that something will be changed in you from the broken bone, then use splints: and it is that you place over the fracture itself a splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints. And place between each splint the width of a finger: and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
Then bind over the splints the bandage which I described at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is that your bandage over the place of the fracture be tighter. And the more the fracture is lengthened, let the bandage be less tight.
If therefore you see the placement of the splints and the bandage, as we have said, at the hour in which you restore the limb immediately, then do so: and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave off the bandage and splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Then consider the bandage in all three days, lest itching or swelling occur in the place, or food be prevented from reaching the member, because of the disposition of superfluous tightness of the bandage. Therefore rectify all that, according to what we have said.
But if you are confident that nothing will happen from it, then do not loosen the bandage except after three days, or more.
And let the sleep of the patient be on his back, and his hands on his stomach: and place under the armpit a cushion filled with wool evenly.
And observe at every hour of the night or day, lest the shape of the broken member be loosened, or the bandage softened. Therefore rectify all that by your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order which we have set forth, so that the food may be light at first, until the mouth begins to tighten: then it is necessary to increase his food.
For it is the custom of the arm and leg, that it be bound for forty days: then therefore it is necessary that it be unbound, and a bath be administered, and it be treated with ointments which restore it.
But if the fracture be foul, and comminuted, then do not unbind the bandage and splints until fifty days, and even up to two months.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two forearms.
Of these, one is small; and it is that which follows the thumb. And the other is large, and it is that which is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Perhaps therefore only the larger forearm is broken, or the smaller; and perhaps they are broken together.
When therefore the small upper forearm is broken, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the lower forearm is broken, its fracture is bad, and its healing difficult.
And it is worse when both bones are broken together.
If therefore the bone which is broken is the small upper forearm, then it is suitable for the physician in its restoration, that he place a small extension easily, until he sets it.
But if it is the large forearm which is broken: then it is necessary that he place a much stronger binding.
And it is necessary that he place the shape of the hand in its restoration, and its extension extended on a cushion. And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers: and let the lowest joint be lower than all the fingers, or the rest: and let the patient sit squarely on himself, and let the cushion be before him, or directly in front of him, at such a height, that the patient does not incur exertion.
Then let the attendant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand, or with a bandage. And let another attendant extend it from above similarly.
Then let the physician set the bone, until he restores it according to the best shape that he can.
But if in the fracture of the bone there are splinters, then try to restore every fragment to its place by your skill.
But if a separated splinter appears in it, and pierces the skin, and you have no hope in restoring it: then incise over it, and remove it according to the method which we have described in those things which have been previously mentioned.
But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter for that, therefore take its treatment from there.
But if a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then smear a cloth with cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth over it with a light bandage, until the abscess subsides: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from mill dust with egg white. Then apply splints, and let the splint which is placed over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases: whether the fracture is in one bone, or in two bones at the same time.
Then apply your bandage over the place of fracture more firmly and tightly, and somewhat more with the bandage to the upper parts of the fracture, or to its lower parts: or apply a bandage somewhat softer than that, according to what preceded its mention at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths which are wrapped over the fracture be soft, moist cloths: and let them not be hard, rough. And let the thread with which it is bound be of linen, properly, a medium between fine and thick, as we have narrated.
And consider the limb and the bandage after some days. But if something happens which requires correction, such as itching which happens to the limb: then it is necessary that you bathe the limb with warm water, until that itching ceases, and you leave the limb unbound, until it rests; then repeat the bandage.
But if the bandage is now softened, and the bone now removed, and similar things to those: then rectify all that with your skill, and consider again.
For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of the excess of the bandage, then it is necessary that you soften it a little, and leave it for a few days, until nourishment flows to it, then bind it.
But if nothing of what we have said happens to the patient, then it is not necessary that it be loosened, except after twenty days, or about those.
Then let the patient's hand be suspended from his neck. And let his neck be straight, and let it be kept by its own strength from agitated movements. And make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days. All that is according to the dispositions of complexions, and dispositions of strength.
Concerning the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Know that a fracture rarely happens to the back of the hand and the knuckles of the fingers. And it does not happen to it except by much rubbing.
Therefore when a fracture or rubbing happens to the palm, then it is necessary that the sick person sit squarely; and opposite him should be a seat of equal height. Then place his hand upon it extended.
Then let the assistant extend the broken bones, and let the physician align them until when they are joined with a good joining.
Then it is necessary that he apply a plaster and lint, if a hot abscess does not occur. Then place a splint on top according to the size of the place; and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the lower parts around the sole of the foot, then make something similar to a sphere from cloth; and instruct the patient to bind it over it with his broken foot; then let it be bound with a long cloth.
And let the splint be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather may be applied with the body of the foot; and bind it, according to what is necessary.
But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary that you place one splint on top, and another splint below on the sole; and let the hand be open and straight. Then apply a bandage, as the hand is rolled; and extend between the fingers with a ligature.
But if a fracture happens to any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it is to be set according to what is necessary. Then it is to be bound with the sole; and if you wish, place a small, straight splint on it, so that the fracture may be raised, and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, or little, and ring finger, then it is set, and bound with the healthy finger which follows it; or all are bound together continuously; and that is better. Or place a small splint over it, as we said in the case of the thumb.
And consider in your restoration, and after the disposition of a warm abscess, and oppose it with what is necessary, when something happens from it, according to what is repeated in its account.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the hip.
The hip bone is often fractured, and this is apparent to the senses: because it is turned towards the inner and posterior parts.
And its restoration is done in such a way that a ligament is tightened above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture. And let the patient be laid on his face.
Then let the attendant extend each ligament to its part equally; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if the fracture is close to the root of the hip, then let the ligament be to the part of the pecten, so that the extension falls upwards; and another ligament below the fracture.
And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then let the ligament be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Then let the physician equalize the bone with both his hands, until he restores it according to the likeness of its natural form: and let the bone be joined with a good joining.
Then it is necessary that you place a plaster and a bandage, if an abscess does not occur in the limb. But if an abscess occurs in it, then leave it for a few days, until the hot abscess is settled, then return to your treatment.
Moreover, its bandage should be like this. It is necessary that you wrap a hard bandage, that is, a linen cloth, over the fracture; and double it twice, or three times; and let a surplus remain from it. Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches the root of the buttocks.
And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee towards the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts. Then roll over the leg and hip what is superfluous from the bandage.
Then place splints over the hip at the place of its fracture, and place one of them over the bone of the leg.
Then fill the spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the constriction is even.
Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle over the place of the fracture with three or four turns. And the more you extend with the bandage from the place of the fracture, let your constriction be less and softer, and gentler.
Then attend to the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the hip and leg. Therefore, tie with both three small bandages which are above. Then go with the two ends of the thread to the lower parts, until you reach the heel of the foot. And with both, tighten also the ends of the bandages from the other side, so that the bandage is not removed from its place.
Then loosen the constriction over it, while it remains, so that neither corrosion, nor abscess, nor swelling, nor things similar to them happen to the limb. If something of that happens. Therefore hasten with its loosening, and correct everything that happened from it, according to what we have said many times.
If, however, there is a piece of bone in the bone that is causing a puncture: then it is necessary to level it, if it is possible for you. And if not, make an incision over it and remove it: and treat it with that whose previous mention has been made, until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the hip is constricted, besides which splints are added to it, as we said in the case of the arm and shoulder.
Nevertheless, in the restoration of it thus fractured, lameness does not happen to the patient. And if it is restored alone, besides which the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he whose it is will always limp.
And know that the hip is constricted in fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is subtracted: all that is according to the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap rarely happens, but attrition happens to it very often.
If, however, a fracture happens to it, then it is only either a fissure or a hole in its parts. And this is with a wound, and without a wound. And the whole thing is treated with sense.
And its restoration is such that what is disrupted of its parts is equated with the fingers, until it is aggregated and joined together as much as is possible by means of equation and ease, and fabrication.
Then apply a plaster of sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white: and place a round compress over it, if you need it: and bind it above with a bandage suitable for it.
Then consider all the dispositions which we have narrated in the other fractures: such as a hot abscess, and similar to it: so that you oppose every accident with that which is suitable to it, until it is healed.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the leg.
Know that the leg has two bones, of which one is thick, and is named by the name of the leg: and the other is thin, and is named the fibula.
And the same kinds of fractures happen to both as happen to the two bones of the arm: and because of that, its restoration is done, like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
If both bones are broken, the leg is turned in all directions.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is turned to the front.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it lower down: and it is among those which are not hidden from you.
Then administer extension, and equalization, and the tying of splints according to that equally.
However, if the fracture of the leg is a bad fracture, having many splinters, the extension should be less, and your alleviation gentler.
And in the leg indeed there is something in the operation beyond the arm: and it is that when you equalize the splints, and have completed all your operation, then take two splints of pine wood, which is used in the making of sunshades which is put under boards: and they are made from palm spatulas: and choose from them those which are of small thickness, and neither let them be from the small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Then wrap over each one a cloth with two wrappings according to its length. And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee to the lower part of the foot.
Then bind the two splints in three places, at the two ends and the middle. For when constriction is prevented, the leg inclines neither to the right nor to the left, and stands in a good position.
And now indeed let a cradle be made of wood according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it may preserve it from movement.
And it is especially necessary that you do this in a fracture when there is a proper wound with it.
Then examine the leg every day, and treat it diligently against an abscess, or inflammation, or other such things. If therefore anything of these things happens, then oppose it with what is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills.
Concerning the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes.
Indeed, a complete fracture does not happen to the heel bone.
However, fracture sometimes happens to the bones of the foot, and fracture also happens little to the toes: and attrition happens to them in most instances, not fracture.
If fracture happens to the bones of the foot, and you see those bones raised up on top of each other, then let the patient put his foot on the prepared ground, as if walking.
Then stand you, and put your foot on that which is raised up from those bones; afterwards press, or tread on it; and equalize it, until it returns to its places.
Then apply a plaster, and lint on top; and place under the sole of the foot a small board, which has two flat ends.
Then bind it with a suitable bandage around the foot, after you have wrapped it with cloths, and other things which it needs.
When therefore three or four days pass, then untie the bandage. For you will find the bones even, whether they are fractured, or dislocated. Therefore the operation in them is as you see.
But if some fingers are broken, then restore them and align them according to what I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place a splint with your finger along the length of the finger, and let it be a little wider than it: then place this board which I have told you about under the foot, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
But if what is broken of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place on each finger a splint of its size, wrapped in linen cloth: and bind the board to the lower part of the foot: and let it stand on one end of the board outside the belly of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
And it is fitting for you, that you do not forget, but consider all that I have told you in the other fractures from the accidents which we have spoken of: and apply to each accident what is necessary.
Concerning the fracture of a woman's vulva, and of the pubic bone, and of a man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is broken, then make her sit squarely. Then incline her slightly toward her back, and let her be held back.
Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton until she fills it; and let it be made into a sphere in the vulva from it.
Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually. Then that cotton comes out, until it becomes like a sphere before the opening of the vulva, and the broken bone returns.
Then place a cushion on her back. Therefore, when she wants to urinate, let her remove the cotton easily, then let her urinate: and let her replace it in the way in which you inserted it at first: then let her return to her first cushion.
Let her do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the bone itself is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a reed tube over its opening, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva. Then blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder is inflated inside the vulva, for the fracture returns.
Then let it be filled with cotton, and let it remain for a few days, as we have described, until it is healed.
And when the pubic bone of a man or a woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and its alignment what we have described for the hip bone.
And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures which occur slightly, especially to someone who has some skill or experience.
And understand this book of mine well, because the fracture itself indicates to you in many situations the proper method for its restoration and its straightening; therefore understand.
But when the penis is broken, take a goose's neck and insert the penis into it. Then place over it a bandage of cloth, and it should be bandaged, and left for three days or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the bones when it is with a wound.
It is fitting for one to whom a fracture with a wound has happened, especially if it is a large one, such as of the hip bone, or of the thigh bone, or similar to it, that you should hasten and immediately bleed him: if the conditions for bleeding attest to you, as we have explained beforehand.
But if the wound flows blood, then it is necessary that you hasten to its excision, so that you may sprinkle upon it crushed alum: if nothing else is present to you.
Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not postpone it, if an abscess does not occur.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then postpone its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess is settled. And do not approach it on the third day, and on the fourth absolutely, for you would cause bad things to happen to it.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, uncovered: then it is necessary that you try to reduce it, and to equalize it with your hands with ease and slight extension.
But if the extension of it, and its equalization with your hands, is not prepared: then reduce it with this instrument. And it is an instrument which is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven or eight fingers: and its width is according to the quantity of the wound. And because of that it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them, according to the quantity which he needs for it in the treatment of every kind of fracture.
And let it be round: and let there be in it a small thickness, so that it is not doubled up during compression upon it at the time of operation: and let it have a sharp end, which has a margin at its extremities. And let its upper part be thicker than its lower part.
And this is its form.
It is necessary in this operation that its sharp curved end be placed upon the end of the protruding bone; and push it with it at once, until the bone returns and is made even by a certain alignment.
Therefore try to align the ends of the fracture to each other.
But if the ends of the broken bone are small, and the instrument does not grasp it well, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument can hold it.
If however you cannot reduce them completely with what we have described, then incise it with whatever is suitable from the incisors which we have mentioned: or saw it with one of the saws in whichever way is possible for you.
Then shave off what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
Therefore when the bone is reduced, and the patient finds intense, hurting pain after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Then do this. For you provide the patient with great help when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Then submerge the cloth in astringent, black wine. And especially if it is summer. And do not place cerate over the wound, nor anything containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption therein.
Then apply small splints at the completion of your bone restoration. And leave the wound uncovered, so that you cut a hole in the bandages with scissors according to the size of the wound.
And take every precaution lest you constrict the wound with a fracture. For many times foolish physicians have done this, and have caused death, or corrosion, or zuchem, that is, pus, to befall their patients. And let your binding be soft, gentle, different from the binding of other fractures.
But if the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some bad occurrences which we have mentioned, and you find pain suspended in the place: then it is not necessary that you place splints upon it. And make for them wrappings of hard cloths in place of splints, and bind it with them.
But when it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove from upon it the cloth which you placed upon it with wine. Then administer lint and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds: such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar things.
And it is fitting for you to loosen the binding. And examine the wound every day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus flows from it downwards with ease.
But if many days pass for the wound and it does not consolidate, nor is pus discharged from it: then know that there are small splinters of bone there. Therefore it is necessary that you explore the wound with a probe. However many of those splinters are separated, remove and extract them. And those of them which are not separated, and prick the limb, and cause pain to occur, try to incise them, and remove them in every way that is possible for you.
But if a canker, or ekileten, that is, an esthiomenus, or another type of corruption and putrefaction happens to the wound: then it is necessary that you oppose each of them with that which is suitable for it from the treatment, the account of which preceded in its chapter.
And that concerning which my speech must stand, and to which you should direct your attention when a bone is broken and protrudes above the limb, such as the hip bone, and the collar bone, and similar large bones, is that you should not attempt its extraction, for very often death results from this, but rather leave it until it putrefies.
For perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then therefore treat the wound, if it seems good to you; and if not, leave it.
Concerning the treatment of a node in the track of a fracture.
This node often occurs in the track of the healing of a fracture. Especially that which is near the joints, and the shape of the limb is disfigured by it. And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Therefore consider then, if the node is recent: administer to it medicines which have astringency, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things.
So that you may take some of these, or all of them: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and put them on the node in a pledget, and bind them tightly upon it with a good bandage.
And leave the bandage, and do not loosen it for many days. Then loosen it, and apply another, until the node is removed.
Or bind a lead plate neatly upon it. For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
But if the node has already turned into stone, and is constricted, and urgent necessity compels its removal: then incise it from its upper part, and cut away the protruding excess: or shave it with some razors, until it is removed: and treat it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment when it is restored, and the limb remains afterwards thin, not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is restored, and the limb afterwards remains thin, weak: then this does not happen except for many reasons. One of which is, the multitude of the loosening of the ligament and its binding not as it ought: or because of the excess of constriction of the ligaments, until nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb: or because of the multitude of superfluous embrocation at an unsuitable time: or because of the small amount of blood in the body of the patient, and his weakness.
And its treatment is, to nourish the patient, and make his body strong, until the blood is multiplied in him. And administer a bath. And introduce joy and happiness to him.
Then place pitch on the limb: so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it. And frequently embrocate it with warm water, until nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they are set crookedly.
When crookedness and a prominence of the broken bone, or a knot, occurs in a limb already set after its healing, and the form of the limb is disfigured thereby, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural function: then it is not necessary to heed the opinion of him who thinks that the limb should be broken again.
And there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land.
And this operation is indeed highly reprehensible, leading to death, or great fear, so that it is certainly deadly.
But if the lameness and knotting are recent, then it is necessary that it be bathed with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as mallow leaves and root, and melilot, and the like. And let a plaster be made with a softening plaster, such as properly made diachylon.
Or let the mucilage of mallow root be taken, and shaken with hen's fat, or sesame oil: and let it be plastered with it.
Or let fat figs be taken, and ground with pigeon dung, and similar things which are named among medicines that lessen consolidation.
And sometimes the knotting is resolved with frequent, gentle, and long rubbing, which is done with wet hands. And let movement of the limb be administered to every part at all hours.
But if tortuosity has preceded, and become strong, and has been converted into stone, and necessity has been provoked to its cure with iron: then it is necessary that its upper part be cut, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and that which superabounds from the knotting or bone be incised with fine scalpels: and let ease be administered in it with care and diligence.
Concerning the speech on dislocation.
Dislocation is the exit of any of the joints from its place. Therefore it is prevented from its motion, and the shape of the member is deformed. And it causes the infirm to suffer pains and severe injuries.
Therefore, when a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration; and not delay it at all.
For if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Therefore, on account of that, it ought not to be moved, nor extended at the time of its inflammation. Because it very often causes spasms and painful injuries.
But when that happens, then it is necessary that you hasten to the bloodletting of the patient. Then let it be left alone until the inflammation subsides.
Then let the limb be rubbed with warm water and oil. Then let it be reduced easily.
And let every limb be treated with that whose remembrance will come in its place.
Indeed, I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, even as preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body to its lower part.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The two jaws are rarely dislocated, except rarely.
And the dislocation of both happens according to one of two methods. For either they are removed from their places by a small removal, and are softened a little. Or they are dislocated by a whole, complete dislocation, until they are softened to the breast, until the saliva of the sick person flows, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is involved with speech.
When, however, its dislocation is small, then it returns in most instances by itself with little [effort].
If, however, the dislocation is complete, whole: then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not be delayed at all: and it is so that a helper holds the head of the sick person: and the physician inserts the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the jaw of the dislocation between his mouth, if the dislocation is on one side. Or he inserts his two thumbs together, if the dislocation is on two sides. And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he may pull.
And instruct the patient to clean his jaws, and to loosen them for eating on every side. And the physician pulls the jaw, and pushes the jaw, until it returns to its place.
But if its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are affected at the same time: then administer a vaporization with warm water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy: nor should you delay the reduction of both completely, as we have said.
Therefore, when they return and are aligned, and the mouth of the patient is closed, and they are not softened: then place on them small pads of cloth, with cerate that is made from wax and rose oil.
Then it should be tied easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on his back: and let his head be supported between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right and left: nor let him try, or be forced to chew anything: rather, let his food be a gentle sipping, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is set: then let him eat what he wants, and let that be administered with ease.
Let him not strain his mouth during eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is set, and healed.
But if the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at some time, and are not returned to their places: then fevers often arise from this, and constant thirst: and perhaps the patient's bowels are loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Therefore when you see that, then know that it is a loss, and very often he to whom this happens dies within ten days.
Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle, and the end of the shoulder.
Indeed, the clavicle is not dislocated from the inner side, because of its connection with the chest. And it is sometimes dislocated outwards; and this is apparent to the senses.
And its restoration is that the patient should lie on his back, and extend his arms. Then firmly compress the place with your palm, for it will return itself.
Then place a plaster and compresses on it, and bind it.
However, the extremities which follow the elbow and are continuous with it, are not dislocated except rarely. But if it is dislocated on some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and set according to what we have said, and what is prepared for you.
Then place a plaster, compresses, and a bandage on it. And instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
And with this same treatment the extremity of the humerus is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
Concerning the reduction of a dislocation of the humerus.
Know that the humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
One of which is that it is dislocated towards the armpit inferiorly. The second is that it is dislocated towards the chest. And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the humerus: and that happens rarely.
And it is not dislocated posteriorly, because of the scapula. And it is not dislocated anteriorly, because of the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and exits inferiorly towards the armpit: especially in those whose flesh is scant. Because it exits quickly in them, and enters quickly.
But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, namely because it exits with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
And perhaps it happens to some men through a blow, or a fall, and the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is thought because of that, that it is already dislocated.
Therefore, it is necessary that you investigate it, until you stand upon its certainty, and then you proceed in its cure.
And a dislocation is known when it is towards the lower parts in relation to the armpit: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus. For you find a manifest difference between them, and you find in the head of the humerus a concavity, and under the armpit on palpation the head of the humerus as if it were an egg: and the sick man cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all motions.
And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you find a manifest touch, nor is it hidden.
And indeed, the reduction of this dislocation is easy when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
And its reduction is that a helper raises his hand upwards. Then place your thumbs under his armpit, and raise the joint forcefully upwards to its place: and the helper raise his hand and extend it upwards. Then let him place it lower, for indeed it returns quickly.
But if it does not return by what we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred: then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and a softening and soothing embrocation be applied, such as if the roots of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot are decocted in water, and applied.
Then the patient is laid on his back; and a ball and wool are placed under his armpit, which is equal between softness and firmness.
Then let the physician place his heel on the ball, and raise the head of the humerus forcefully, and pull the patient's hand downwards.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is that you cause a man to be present who is taller than the patient, and stands on the side, and inserts his shoulder under the patient's armpit; and raises his armpit upwards, until the patient is suspended in the air. And another assistant pulls the patient's hand towards his lower abdomen. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that a long piece of wood is fixed in the ground, the head of which is round in shape, like the handle of a mortar: which is neither thick nor thin. Then let it be placed under the patient after soft cloths are placed on the head of the wood; and let the patient stand along the length of the wood.
Then his hand is extended downwards on the other side, and his body is extended on the other side with force; for the joint returns to its place quickly.
But if its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is that you take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness the quantity of two fingers: which has a round head, so that its entry into the depth of the rectum is eased, according to this form.
Then soft cloths are tied over the round head, so that the wood does not injure the patient.
Then let it be placed under the patient's rectum, so that the hand or arm is extended over the wood downwards; and let the wood be tied over the support and arm and the end of the hand.
Then let the arm be placed on the step of a ladder across its width, and let the hand be extended downwards, and let the rest of the body be left hanging on the other side. For the joint enters immediately.
Therefore, when its entry is completed in whatever way is possible, then it is necessary that you place under the rectum a sphere of equal size made of wool. Then place the plaster prepared from mill dust with olibanum and egg white over the whole shoulder, as it is rolled over.
Then bind below the rectum with a suitable bandage; and let the bandage be rolled over the plaster from above; and let his hand be bound to his neck, and let it be left, nor let his hand be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the food of the patient be meager, until the limb is strengthened; for this is quicker for its healing.
Then let more be given after seven days, or five, and let it be exercised with movement. If therefore it is strengthened and not softened, then it is now healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture which happens to it, or because of another cause: then it is necessary that a cautery with three holes be applied to it, according to what was stated before in the chapter on cautery.
But if all this is done, and the bandage is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and constriction are applied over it several times, and it is not strengthened, and it falls, and he cannot raise it to the upper parts: then know that its nerves which are at the head of the shoulder are now cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The reduction, however, of a dislocation which occurs towards the breast and nipple, or towards the back, is done with pushing and extension with the hands: until it returns, and the remaining constriction and care are applied to it, until it is healed.
But if after healing heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then let the infirm person use a bath many times, until that heaviness is lessened, and it returns to its first nature.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty also: and it is indeed dislocated to all parts, and especially to the anterior, or to the posterior.
And its dislocation is not hidden from you: because it is falling under sight, and under touch, according to whichever form it is dislocated. And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clearly shown to you. For the joint is concave, and he cannot bend the arm, nor touch his shoulder with it.
And it is necessary that you hasten, and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess happens to it.
For if a hot abscess happens to it, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it is not healed completely, especially when it is at the back. For it is worse than all kinds of dislocation, and of more vehement pain than them: and very often death comes with it.
And its restoration, when it is of those which it is possible to reduce, is that his hand be extended with two hands: and his arm be extended, and the physician's hands be above the elbow and under it, and he himself push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Or indeed the dislocation is to the front: then it returns thus, that he doubles the hand with his hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
But if the dislocation does not obey reduction, then administer a vehement extension, very strong: and it is that two assistants extend the arm: and two assistants also hold him, so that he is not moved during the extension.
Then let the arm be revolved to every part after a doubled long cloth, or a broad ligament, is wrapped around his hand.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil: so that it may be of those things which aid in the lubricity of the joint with ease. Then let him impel the joint with a vehement impulse, until it returns.
And after its reduction it is necessary that a plaster be placed upon it, in which there is stypticity, and desiccation with egg white: and let it be bound with a decent bandage. And let the arm be suspended from the neck of the infirm one: and leave it for a few days.
Then let it be unbound. If therefore the joint is strengthened in its place, then unbind the ligature from it, and leave it.
And if you see the joint not well bound, then repeat the plaster and the bandage, and leave it for several days, until it is bound. Then unbind it.
But if heaviness occurs to it after reduction of the joint, and the disposition is in motion: then administer moistening in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is lined, or place on the joint the fat of a ram, that is, the rump of a ram. Then let it be bound, and leave it on it day and night. Then remove it, and put it into the bath. When therefore it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction. Then repeat on it the application of ram's fat once, and a second, and a third time with the bath's entry, until it is softened.
And if you wish, place on it cow dung, moist, warmed with butter, and bind it on.
Do this several times. For it is thus softened, and returns to its proper condition.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation, Almahassen.
The hand is very often dislocated by Almahassen, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy. Contrary to the other joints. However, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of its dislocation at the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place is inflamed: or a hot abscess occurs in it.
And the reduction of the dislocation in it is that you place the weak hand of Almahassen on a board, and the attendant extends his hand: and the physician places his palm on the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
However, it is necessary that it be considered whether the palm has already receded to the belly of the hand: then let the infirm person place the back of his hand on the board during extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be intrinsically on the board, that is, the inner part of his hand be placed on the board, so that the physician's hand falls upon the prominence of the joint itself.
If therefore it returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a plaster soothing the abscess: and leave it, nor repeat it.
For if it does not tolerate, nor can you achieve its reduction after days have passed, but nevertheless the joint remains according to its crookedness: and it does not harm the infirm person in any way, except that the hand is softened, and cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves are severed, or abraded.
Therefore there is no remedy for it, except that it be bound with a cautery near its case. And perhaps that does not contribute anything.
Therefore, when Almahassem does not return, then place upon it the plaster which we have described. Then let it be bound, and left for five days; afterwards let it be unbound and left, and the hand exercised.
But if its movement is deprived, and something serious happens to it: then soften it with warm water, and friction several times, until it softens.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of fingers.
When a finger is dislocated in any direction, or a finger to the back of the palm, or its belly: then extend the finger, and push back the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straight on that day.
When it is night, bind it according to the same account: and do not cease to unbind it during the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Do this for several days, until it is tightened.
And similarly do with it, if it is dislocated towards the belly of the hand: and bind it to that part, and perform your first operation on it, until it is healed.
And similarly do with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation of the vertebrae of the back or neck happens to someone, or many vertebrae are removed from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death quickly approaches the sick person.
And a sign of that is that the excrement of the sick person goes out without will, nor can he hold it back: and very often some of his limbs are weakened from it, or his two legs, or his two arms, or one of them: or one vertebra is removed from its place.
For very often it is removed, which very often makes the removal of them to four parts.
That which is removed to the rear is called a hump.
The cure however of it is that you consider then, if the hump happened from childhood: then there is no cure for it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
But in that which happens from a fall, or blow, or similar things, the ancients have already spoken of methods of cure at great length. Of which very little returns with profit.
I however have now shortened it from that, of which little excuses much of it from my proximity to the intention: and my exposition by which I have expounded it, and formed its instrument in a different way from that by which they showed it, and expounded it.
I say therefore that in a hump which happens from the front part, there is no skill, nor healing from it.
And similarly in that which is on both sides also.
And it is not cured from them, except that which happens in the back properly, with that which I relate: and it is, that the infirm person be extended upon his face upon a level surface near a wall: and a wet mat be spread under him, so that his chest is not injured.
Then let a straight piece of wood be placed fixed in a hole in the ground, at the head of the surface: and another piece of wood near his feet at the other end of the surface: and let an assistant hold the wood, and let it not be fixed in a hole. And let another assistant hold the other.
Then wrap around the head of the sick person, and under his armpits, a soft, firm ligature: and extend the end of the ligature to the wood which is at his head: and tie it to it.
Then tighten another ligature above his hips, and above his knees, and at his ankles. Then gather all the ligatures, and tie them to the other wood which is at his feet.
Then let each assistant extend a part of the ligature to the wood, and let the two woods not be removed from their places in which they are fixed; but nevertheless let them not be fixed, as we have said.
And the physician shall place his palms upon the vertebrae with strength, until it returns; or let him place a board upon it. Then let him attach his feet to the board until it returns.
But if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits. And hollow out in the wall, of which we have spoken, which is near the patient, a place into which the end of the board may enter. Then place the middle of the board upon the vertebra. And let the physician place his feet upon the other end. And let him pull strongly until the vertebra is constricted, and returns to its place.
Then if you wish, work with a lathe which is turned with your hand: and it is, that you fix in the ground near the head of the patient at the end of the bed two pieces of wood, whose length is that of one arm: and near his head at the end of the bed two pieces of wood.
And let the length which is between each piece of wood be one palm: and now a hole has been made in every place, in which the lathe runs: and let every piece of wood be firmly fixed in the ground, lest it be moved at all.
And let a round piece of wood be inserted: and it is a lathe in which the rope revolves in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its extremity is a hole, in which is fixed a piece of wood, whose length is a palm together with that which revolves: and in two other pieces of wood there is similarly that.
Then tighten the bandages which you have tightened on the chest of the patient with the lathe which is near his head: and the bandages which you have tightened on his legs with the lathe which is near his feet.
Then let a servant stand by each lathe, who turns his hand with the rope, with which the lathe revolves: and let the physician adjust the vertebra, as we have said.
This is the form of the lathe, which follows.
Then after the vertebra returns and the place is even, then it is necessary that you place a drying plaster with egg white. Then lint. Afterwards, place on top of the plaster a small plate of wood, whose width is three fingers, or thereabouts. And its length a quantity which takes in the place of the hump, and above the part of the healthy vertebra.
Then let it be bound with the bandage which we have described. And let the patient use a light diet until he is healed.
But if something of a prominence remains in the place at the end of healing, then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, with the application of the plate which we have described for a long time. And now a lead plate is applied to it.
And sometimes a prominence occurs in the last vertebra of the back; and a dislocation is thought to be caused by it, and it is that bone which now protrudes. Therefore, a presumption should not be made about it with this medicine; for perhaps it will cause death.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that in the hip joint and the shoulder joint, only dislocation occurs; nor does what happens to the other joints from a small displacement and concavity happen to them.
And the hip joint indeed is dislocated in four ways. That is, because it is dislocated anteriorly and posteriorly.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards; and it is slightly dislocated anteriorly and posteriorly.
And the treatment of its inward dislocation is: because when you join the injured leg with the healthy one, it is longer; and its knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the injured person cannot bend his foot at the groin; and the place which follows the groin is inflamed with a hot inflammation, because the head of the femur has already arrived there.
And the sign of him to whom outward dislocation happens is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And the sign of him to whom anterior dislocation happens is that he extends the healthy leg completely; however, he does not bend it without pain in the knee; and if he tries to walk, he cannot step forward on it; and his urine is retained, and his groin is inflamed, and when walking he treads on his heel.
And the sign of him to whom posterior dislocation happens is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin; and his leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is at the place of the ilium.
The reduction however of this kind of dislocation is such that you consider then, if the dislocation is old, which is already long-standing in the one having it. Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its disposition: then there is no cure at all in it. Therefore, a complete presumption should not be made for it.
But in him whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four kinds of dislocation: then hasten to this, that you move the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left: for perhaps it returns, and does not need other care.
But if it does not return in this way, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant, and he extend his leg from below: either with his hands, or with a ligature, which is tied above his leg above the knee: and another assistant extend his arm from above, so that he puts his hands under his armpits. Then let him bind with a soft ligature above the root of the hip, and hold the end of the other ligature.
And let its extension be either from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the clavicle, or from the posterior to the part of the back.
And let the extension of them all be at once, until the sick man is raised with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
And this kind of extension is a common kind of the four kinds.
If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary for every kind that which I shall say of proper cure.
In its proper reduction, when the dislocation is towards the inner parts, it is necessary that the sick man be laid on his sound side. Then let him place a bandage above the root of the hip, in that which is between the head of the hip and the place which is under the groin. Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the clavicle.
Then let another strong assistant take his arms, and lessen the thickened place of the diseased hip, and extend it outwards with a strong extension. Now indeed it returns to its place.
And this method is easier than the other methods of cure, by which this limb is reduced.
But if he rebels against you, and does not obey you in entering upon this method of cure at all: then it is necessary that the two feet of the invalid be bound together with a strong, soft bandage, above the two heels, and above the two knees: and let the length of each from its fellow be the quantity of four fingers: and let the diseased leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Then let the patient be suspended from the head of a beam which is in the house: and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Then order a strong youth to support the head of the hip; and let another youth be suspended with the invalid: and let another youth push, supporting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
But in its proper reduction, when the dislocation is outwards, it is necessary that the patient lie upon a bench, according to what we have narrated in the case of him who has a hump. And let a bandage be drawn tight above his leg, the diseased one properly, and above his chest.
Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head. Then let a piece of wood be added in the middle of the bench, firmly fixed: upon which let wet cloths be wrapped, so that it may not injure the patient: and let the wood be between his hips, so that he may not be drawn downwards during extension.
Then let each assistant extend to his part, and let the physician equalize the reduction with his hand.
If therefore it yields to repositioning, it will be good.
And if not, place it upon the board, and press it, as we said in the case of a hump, evenly. However, it is necessary that the patient lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the injured person be extended quickly: and it is according to this same account on the board: and let the physician place the palm of his right hand upon the groin of the injured person. Then he constricts it with the other hand, and with that constriction he puts it extended downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is to the rear: then it is not necessary that the injured person be extended downwards, and be raised above the ground: rather it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard thing, just as it is necessary that it be done even if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we said about his lying upon two hips: and it is upon his face, and the ligaments extended: according to what we said recently.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also upon the place to which the joint goes, when the reduction is completed as is necessary.
And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is that you extend the two legs of the injured person: and when you see them equal, and the injured person draws his leg, and extends it without difficulty: then you know that the limb is now reduced, as is necessary: then join the two hips, and apply a plaster, and bind it with a bandage, that is, a roller: so that the hip does not move to any side: and let the injured person adhere to rest for three days, or four.
Then loosen the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in position, then know that the dislocation is now fixed: therefore allow the injured person to walk.
And if you see any softening: then return, and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Then loosen it and make him delay in walking on both for some days, until it is well strengthened.
Concerning the dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways. It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, that is to say backwards.
And it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to apply his leg to his hip. If, however, it does not adhere to the hip, then know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all types of its dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he extends his leg if he can upon it, and you place your back against his face; and put his foot between your feet.
Then make his knee adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers above his knee. Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength. And another assistant should extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres with the hip gently, not laboriously.
Then plaster it, and make the leg adhere to the hip. Then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days. Then unbind them.
And let the patient not use walking for some days, until it is healed.
But if the reduction is refused by you, then administer strong extension with the bandages, the description of which preceded in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocation of the heel bone.
The heel bone is sometimes removed by a small removal, and sometimes dislocated according to the whole. And its dislocation happens, either inwards, or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, protruding towards the part to which it is dislocated.
The treatment, however, of its removal, is easy restoration: and it is that it is extended easily with the hands, and is set, until it returns.
In the treatment, however, when it is dislocated completely, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit upright; and let a strong assistant hold him firmly from the posterior part of his back, in the middle of it.
Then hold you with your right hand his foot from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the place of the heel.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. Then with the left [hand] twice.
Then extend with the left, and push the front of the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
Do that twice, as we have related.
Then push the front of the foot to the leg a third time, and you pull the splint.
If therefore it returns in one or two times according to this method, and you see the foot set, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on it; because it returns.
But if the reduction of it is prevented by what we have related, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a peg firmly in the ground so that it falls between his hips; and you have already wrapped a cloth around it, so that it does not injure the patient.
Then let an assistant take his hip; afterwards let another assistant extend the foot, either with his hands or with a ligature which he ties above the foot. Then let each assistant extend against the extension of his fellow; and let the peg stand between the patient's two hips, retaining him so that his body is not drawn downwards during the extension.
Then let the physician set the dislocation with his hands, and let another assistant hold the sound leg downwards. For the dislocation returns quickly.
When therefore the dislocation returns, and the soundness of its return is declared to you, then apply a plaster and lint, and bind it firmly with ligatures, and bind the foot with a ligature to the leg.
And it is necessary that you beware or be afraid of the nerves which are above the heel posteriorly, lest the ligature be too tight upon them and injure them.
Then leave it for two or three days. If the ligature loosens, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he attempts to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be loosened and corrupted again, and that it will not then receive a cure.
But if a hot abscess occurs to him, then it is necessary that you administer to its alleviation that which we have previously described elsewhere in the treatment, and an embrocation until it is removed.
Concerning the dislocation of the toes, and its cure.
It is necessary that what is dislocated from them be set with slight extension without effort; and this indeed is not difficult, rather it is easy.
But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the dorsum of the foot, then it is necessary that the infirm person sit with his foot on a level place on the ground, or on a board; and he is standing as if walking.
Then you stand, and place your foot on that which protrudes from those joints. Then tread on it with your foot with force, until it returns, and you see it now set, and no prominence appears in the place.
Then place under the belly of his foot a board which holds the whole foot, to which there are two heads. Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days. Then unbind it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is tightened and secured by reduction.
Concerning the types of dislocation with a wound or fracture.
When something of that sort happens, and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often follows: and therefore one ought not to presume to treat such a thing unless one is skilled in the art through long experience, merciful, pious, cautious, not rash, nor presumptuous; and to use, in the beginning, only medicines that soothe hot abscesses; and to leave the outcome to divine judgment. Unless you see, or hope for, salvation from destruction with a mildness of the illness, and in which something of hope appears. Therefore attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning, before a hot abscess occurs.
If then the member returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that soothes the abscess: and treat the wound with what is suitable from drying ointments.
But if the dislocation is with a fracture, and splinters occur in the bone, then attempt their removal, and do in this what we have said in simple illnesses from what preceded in their locations.
And be cautious according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear: according to what my previous instruction to you was.
For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and safer for your body with those in your time.
