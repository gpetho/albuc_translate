Of the form of the clyster
Sometimes one makes a clyster from silver or brass, or cast or hammered bronze; and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those to whom they are administered.
Those that are administered for the treatment of children and who are weak and painful are small.
The shape of the small and large clyster is wide at the top, where the body is tied in this manner:
and it has a separation where the body is tied, as you see, and the lower part is pierced inside; and it has two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and the body where the medicines are placed is made of an animal bladder or parchment, and is pierced all around with small holes,
and has between each hole a finger's width of space, then insert in these holes a strong thread twisted ten or fifteen times around, and assemble the body like a goatskin;
and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then administer the clyster; and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or a similar thing, then insert it gently;
then the administrator presses it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then withdraw the clyster, and raise the patient's legs to the wall,
and if the medicine wants to come out, hold it as long as possible; and if he sleeps with it overnight, it is more helpful.
And if you administer the clyster in the disease of diarrhea, and the medicine rushes to come out, repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the anus, or an abscess, the clyster should be as subtle as for a child;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster on which the leather is tightened:
