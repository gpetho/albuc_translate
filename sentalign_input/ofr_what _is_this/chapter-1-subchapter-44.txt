of the pain of the joints
When joint pain is from moistures that are spread to each limb of the body, and when the pain comes in the feet, which physicians properly call "podagra" (gout), and when it is from a cold cause and medicinal treatments cannot cure it, it is cured by cauteries in this way: make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to this form: 
And if it is necessary that you prick on the surface of the foot, then make a cautery with the entire cautery that is called "point". (or "pointed")
And if the pains reach the knees and other joints, and this happens often, make three or four cauteries on each knee, on each side, with the olive-shaped cautery; and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there longer than it takes for the thickness of the skin to be burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and to the back, administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter. 
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist in two lines; and if any pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the back of the hand; and if the pains reach the elbows or up to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and ensure the patient has good care and takes medicines.
For if you give him good care and you purge the phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
