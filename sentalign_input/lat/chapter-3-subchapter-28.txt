On the treatment of the dislocation of the wrist.
Chapter 29.
The wrist is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Unlike other joints.
However, speed is necessary in the reduction of its dislocation at the hour it becomes dislocated, before the area swells or a warm swelling occurs there.
And the reduction of the dislocation is achieved by placing the wrist of the injured hand on a table, with an assistant extending the hand; and the doctor places his palm over the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns to position.
However, it must be observed if the palm has already shifted toward the inner side of the hand: in that case, the patient places the back of his hand on the table during the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation moves toward the back of the hand, then the hand is placed with its inner side on the table, so that the doctor's hand falls on the prominence of the joint.
If it immediately returns, this is good; if not, then bind it with a plaster that soothes swelling, and leave it without repeating the process.
For if it cannot tolerate it, and you cannot complete the reduction after several days have passed, the joint will remain twisted; it does not harm the patient except that the hand becomes weak and cannot grip anything. Then you know that the nerves are severed or damaged.
There is thus no treatment except to cauterize it near the affected area.
And perhaps this will not help at all.
Therefore, if the wrist does not return, then place upon it the plaster we have described.
Then bind it, and leave it for five days; afterward, unbind it and leave it, and exercise the hand.
If, however, it is deprived of motion, and any heaviness occurs in it, then soften it with warm water and rub it occasionally until it softens.
