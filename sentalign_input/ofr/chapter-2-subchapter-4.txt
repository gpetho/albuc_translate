of tears
When the tears from the eyes descend from the veins that are on the top of the head because of heat, and medical treatment is of no benefit, and you see the patient's face redden, and feel a throbbing in the forehead like a tremor;
and under the eye is tender and moist, so that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are heated and chafed by the burning of the tears, then this treatment is necessary.
And the ancients called it "cure by contusion", and it is that you shave the hair from the forehead of the patient who has this disease, then make three incisions in the forehead equally along the length of the forehead;
and let one of the incisions be about two fingers wide in the middle of the forehead, going down to the nose, and the other two on the sides above the eyelids, and beware of cutting the arteries that are on both sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the connection of the two jawbones, and let each wound be the width of three fingers joined together across;
and have ready a piece of sponge and plenty of cloths to wipe the blood, then apply the sharp spatula on both sides of which this is the form:
from the incision which is towards the temple to the second incision;
and scrape all the flesh that is between the two incisions, along with the pericranium which is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then remove this spatula.
then put in the first incision the instrument which is called "cultellaire", which is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is smooth, not sharp, and this is its shape:
And put the cutting side toward the flesh close to the heart, and the smooth side towards the bone, and insert it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to that which opens to the heart, and then do the same in the middle incision up to the other outside [incision];
and then draw blood evenly, and compress the area because of the blood taken;
then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and put on cloths soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and watch that no hot abscesses develop;
and on the third day untie the bandage, and apply a large amount of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which one treats wounds, until it is healed.
