Chapter forty-nine on incising the swelling that appears because of the artery or vein and is called aneurysm.	CHAPTER FORTY-NINE. On opening a tumour arising from a bloodvessel, called an aneurysm.	0.74922955
If an artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, a swelling often occurs, and similarly, the vein may also experience inflation and swelling.	When an artery is injured and the overlying skin scars, a tumour very often arises from this; the same thing happens to a vein: a swelling and a tumour.	0.791731
The signs by which it is known whether the swelling and inflation are from an artery or a vein are that if the swelling is from an artery, it is oblong, gathered in the depth of the body, and if you press the swelling with your finger, you feel it as if it has a creaking sound, and if it is from a vein, the swelling is round, on the surface of the body.	And these are the signs by which you may diagnose whether the swelling and tumour arise from an artery or a vein: if it be from an artery the tumour will be a deep and elongated mass; and when you press upon it with your finger there will be a feeling of pulsation. But if it arises from a vein the swelling will be circular and superficial.	0.8436893
Incision on these swellings is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many places of the body, and are very large, so you should avoid treating them with iron, and also those in the extremities or the head, so you should avoid [treating them].	It is dangerous to make an incision on tumours of this kind, specially in the axilla, the groin, the neck, and in many other parts of the body; it is indeed highly dangerous, so in these you must avoid treatment by the knife; also in those in the limbs and in the head it must be avoided.	0.8880305
If the swelling is from an incision of the vein, you should hold with your hand as much of the swelling as you can, along with the skin, then insert a needle below the place that you held with your hand, and pass it through, and in it a double thread, until you bring it out from the other side, then tie the swelling well with it, according to what I mentioned to you in tying the uvula from both sides with the ends of the thread.	If the swelling be due to a vein that has been penetrated, you should gather up with your hand as much of the tumour as you can, together with the skin; then pass a needle beneath the place which you have grasped in your hand and run it through, threaded with a double thread, until it emerges at the other side; then with it tie a strong ligature round the swelling as I mentioned to you on ligaturing the swollen uvula, from either side, with the ends of the thread.	0.93481797
If you fear that the threads will slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire swelling at the intersection of the first needle and tighten your threads in four places, then incise the swelling in its middle, so that when what is in it comes out, cut the excess skin and leave what was tied of it.	If you fear that the threads may come loose, pass a second needle and thread beneath the whole tumour to intersect with the passage of the first needle; and tie your threads in four places. Then incise the tumour in the centre to extract the contents. Then cut away the superfluous skin and leave what has been ligatured.	0.88927627
Then put on it a pad that you have dipped in wine and oil, then use the treatment that is with bandages and ointments until it heals.	Then put on that a pad previously soaked in wine and oil; then apply the treatment with lint and ointments until healed.	0.9080897
