to cut the frenulum of the tongue Sometimes this frenulum that comes from under the tongue is either natural, that one is born with it; or by accident from a healed wound; and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and have their head in your lap, and lift the tongue; then cut the sinewy frenulum widely, so that the tongue is freed from its attachment, and if there is hardness or a knot, and it is from the healing of a wound, put the hook there and cut that ligament widely; and be careful that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery that is underneath; and when you have done this, wash the area with rose water and vinegar, or with cold water, then put a linen tent under the tongue; and let the patient hold it there every night, so that the area cannot heal closed.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural and congenital; or it may be accidental, owing to scarring from an injury. The operation for it is to open the patient's mouth, having his head in your lap, and lift his tongue; then cut that sinew-like ligament transversely till the tongue is freed from its hold. If it is hard and nodular, arising from scarring after an injury, catch it with a hook and slit it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots undone. Beware of making the incision deeply into the flesh, or you may cut an artery there and haemorrhage may occur.	0.8574923
And if bleeding occurs, apply ground vitriol to the area; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it with a lentil-shaped cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.	If there should be haemorrhage, put pounded vitriol on the place; and if bleeding still prevails burn the spot with a lenticular cautery of suitable size and treat in the usual way till healed.	0.7927555
