When the fracture of the bone is restored, and the limb remains weak and thin, it happens for many reasons: one is that it was bound too tightly, and not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bindings, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of too much washing; or because of too much movement, not at the right time; or because there is little blood in the body, making it weak.	When a fractured bone has been repaired but the limb remains thin and weak, this may be due to many causes: the bandaging being too often loosened and not properly tightened; or excessive binding-up so that nourishment cannot flow to the limb; or excessive fomenting; or excessive and premature movement; or the thinness and weakness of the patient's blood.	0.89961696
And the cure is to make the patient eat well, and make the body plump, so that the blood multiplies in them; and administer baths, and give them joy and happiness; then apply poultices to the limb, so that the poultice draws great nourishment to it, and frequently wash it with warm water, until the nourishment flows to the limb; and it returns to its natural shape.	The treatment of this consists in the nourishing and restoring of his body so there be plenty of blood; and the use of the bath; and cheering the patient and making him happy, and so on. Then apply pitch to the limb so that it may draw much nourishment to itself, or continue the massage to the limb with tepid water, so that nourishment flows in the limb and it returns to its normal shape.	0.86919105
