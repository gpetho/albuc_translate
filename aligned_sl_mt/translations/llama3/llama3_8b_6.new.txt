Oh, sons, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last of medical science, and because it has been concluded by him in his own time, and because of its explanations and declarations, it seems to me that you will be able to learn from this treatise, which is a part of my operation, namely surgery.
Since my operation is widespread in our region and our time, and the science of it has been greatly damaged, and its practice has ceased; and there remain only a few brief descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which have been much corrupted by errors and neglects, so that the intentions of it are hidden and the force of it is lost and the art.
And it seems to me that you will revitalize this art through the order of this treatise, following the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and so that the forms of the cauterizing instruments and other tools of the craft may be added to the declaration, and prepared in advance, which is necessary.
But the reason why no good craftsman is found with his own hand in our time, is because the art of medicine is long and arduous, and requires its practitioner to be exercised in the science of anatomy, which Galen understood, knowing the joints of the members and their forms, and their conjunction and separation; and having knowledge of bones, nerves, and ligaments, and their number, and the arrangement of them; and of pulsating and quiet veins, and the places where they empty.
And therefore says Hippocrates that a name is not enough, but rather in small things, and most of all in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken of that in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable about anatomy, as we have said, will fall into error, by which men die, just as I have seen many of them, because some are formed in this science and lose their knowledge and experience.
For you saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor who had inserted an abscess into the neck of a woman, and cut some arteries in the neck so that great blood flowed, and the woman died between her legs.
And I saw another doctor who had pulled out a stone from a man's bladder, which he had operated on in his condition, and the stone was large, and it came to him and removed that stone with a piece of the bladder, so that that man died three days later.
And you had already called me away to remove that stone, and I saw that due to the size of the stone and the patient's condition, it was clear to me that he would die.
And I saw another doctor who was taking pay from the duke of our land for surgery, and attempted to set a blacksmith's broken arm in a cast; but the doctor's ignorance caused him to remove the fracture, on top of the wound, with poultices and splints under strong tension, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And he undid it according to his own desires, and rewound it, and commanded that we undo the binding; and thus it happened that the arm and leg became gangrenous, and ended in perdition.
And I was called to him, and prepared to undo the binding, and finally achieved tranquility and alleviated his pains.
But meanwhile corruption was confirmed in the member, so that I could not restrain it, and it did not cease to spread its corruption in the member until the patient died.
And I saw another doctor who perforated a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated about three days later, until the very wickedness of it manifested itself with its lord.
Which is because the cancerous abscess is pure of melancholic humor, whereas it does not need to be brought to its lord with iron force, but rather becomes a member that suffers and is completely consumed by it.
And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you that my operation be divided into two parts: one being the operation associated with health, and the other being the work where danger lurks in major circumstances.
And I have already existed in every place of this book where the operation is one where there is error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you that you guard this and hold it fast, so that the foolish ones do not find a way to speak out and deceive you.
And thus take up your arms with solicitude and protection from God, and your patients with felicity and firmness.
And use the best means with God's guidance to bring about salvation and glorious success, and resist the terrible diseases that are difficult to cure, and keep your arms steady in this which causes you fear, so that your trust in yourself and in your name does not deceive you: for it remains as a source of glory to you, and more so in this world and in eternity to your sanctity.
Galen has said in some of his own sayings: "No heal bad illnesses, lest you fall into the hands of bad doctors."
And I have divided this book into three parts.
The division of the book begins, and first of the first part. The first chapter, orderly arranged from head to foot, in the forms of instruments and in the ironworks of cauterizers, and what is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on suction and perforation, and on cupping, wounds, and extraction of splinters, and similar things to these, all capitulated and ordered according to the forms of instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and on cure of sprains and similar things to these; chapter orderly arranged from head to foot, and according to the forms of instruments.
You should know what quality the joints of that cauterizer have, and in which condition it is prohibited to cauterize.
So I say that the sermon on the quality of the joint of the cauterizer and its instrument is a long and prolix discourse, subtle by science, and secret hidden; and already many wise men have spoken about it, and they have disagreed among themselves, and I will not burden myself with a small part of their sermons, fearing prolongation.
And therefore I say that cauterization agrees with all general complexity universally, which is in material or its materials, except for two complexions, which are complexions cold in material.
In the cold and dry complexion with material it will desiccate; for some said that cauterization is beneficial to this one, and others said the opposite of this, that cauterization is not suitable in a disease which is due to quality and dryness, because nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a cold and dry disease with water that is hot and moist be healed.
And those who say the opposite of this, that through cauterization it is made moist in all cold and dry disease that occurs in the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of man and its humidities to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man hot.
And I say through the sermon of that, that this experiment has been revealed to me on several occasions.
But it is not necessary that what has already been experienced and exercised in the chapter on cauterization comes back to this, and that you know the diversity of human complexions and the disposition of diseases in their respective cases, and the causes of those, and the accidents of theirs, and the space of time for those.
But in other complexions, there is no fear on your part, and most of all in cold and moist diseases, for all doctors have agreed on these, and are not discordant about the joint in cauterization in those.
And understand, sons, that the secret of cure by cauterization with fire and its goodness is such that it is superior to cauterization with medicine combined, because the fire is simple, the action of which only reaches the member being cauterized and does not harm another member adjacent to it except for a small injury.
But the action of medicine combined reaches that far in the members which are distant from it, and very easily brings disease to a member with difficult healing and very easily hurts.
But the fire, by its sublimity and good substance, does not do this but superfluously. It is already known to us through experiment and long service of study in the art on the truth of causes; and therefore I am excused from the length of this sermon. And if it were not that it is not read into my better book in this pause for you, a secret hidden in the fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies and its expulsion by which it expels diseases, with philosophical demonstration, which would be acute in your minds.
And understand, sons, that they disagree about the time when it is convenient to perform cauterization and pause at the best time of spring.
And I say that cauterization is convenient at all times, because the damage caused by accidental timing is submerged in the quality of what is attracted to the cauterization, and most especially if the cauterization is for pains or necessary pains, strong and fierce, which do not suffer tardiness because it is feared of those who come with malice, which is greater than small damage entering through time.
And thus it does not bother your minds, or, sons, this is not esteemed by the common people and foolish doctors, for it is that to that disease which is cured by cauterization, there is no time limit, and they pause at that consequence.
And the cause is not thus as they claim through this, because cauterization is nothing but in a place of medicine that alters the complexion and dries out the humors which are the cause why pains come.
But on the other hand, cauterization is superfluous over medicine because of its own value and virtue in its operation and greatness of its lord.
And it is possible that his disease may return at some hour of time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his disease, and the virtue of him, and what is prepared in his body through the aggregation of superfluities there, and what is brought to him in his acquisition through foods and similar causes; but if the disease in which cauterization is administered is a subtle disease in a member with few superfluities and humors, just like cauterization for toothache and similar pains, it is possible that this pain will not return in him, but rather it will be reduced to smallness.
And besides, the common saying is that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, and it is a desperate measure, not according to what I understand in this, because I believe that there is no cure that profits through medicine or any other cause that approaches cauterization.
And the cause is contrary to this; and I understand that cauterization is the last resort of medicine not at all, but rather when we administer the methods of cure in certain diseases, and those medicines do not concur, and in the end of the cause, one administers cauterization, and profits from it. And hours of this book teach that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to my understanding which I understand from the common people and many foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they did not say this except for the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance.
And they said that the place of cauterization does not make a difference, just as it is not absolutely true, for I have already proven and demonstrated that this is so only in certain bodies, and that cauterization with gold is good and better than with iron just as they say; but on the other hand, when you do cauterization with fire and gold, it is not to your advantage, because it is ignited according to the quantity you want for the hardness of the gold, and it prepares to receive heat; and if you adjust above it ignition so that the gold melts in the fire, and by doing so the artist can see through the occupation of that.
And therefore it is made to do cauterization with iron in such a way that we must be more lightly and more promptly directed towards the right of operation.
And I have already arranged this chapter on cauterization according to chapters, and I have arranged those from head to foot, in order that the one who demands this may find it easily.
The First Chapter.
This cauterization confers on the humidity and coldness over the above-mentioned accident of which there are two causes, namely, the cause of soda and the multitude of raumatic fluxes, called corissa, from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears flowing, and the multitude of sleepiness, and toothache, and yawning, and generally all disease that comes through coldness, just like paralysis, sodomy, and apoplexy, and similar diseases in these maladies.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: first, I command the patient to be purged with a laxative medicine in the head, for three or four nights, according to what the virtue of the patient and his age and habit requires.
And then I command him to shave his head with a razor, and have him sit between the two mattresses on a well-cushioned bench, with his head resting on the pillow.
And then pause the razor's edge at the tip of your thumb, and place it gently over the nostrils between his eyes. But when the tip of your thumb reaches the middle point, mark that spot with a tenta, and then ignite the olive cautery which has this form:
And then place it over the marked spot with the tenta, in a way that it descends slowly, with your thumb gradually constrained little by little, and you turn it around.
And then lift your hand lightly and look at the spot, and if you see that some quantity of bone has been uncovered, just like the quantity of grains of oats, then elevate your hand, and if it is not cooled down with that iron, take another one of those, until what I have told you is seen by the bone.
And then take a small amount of salt and dissolve it over the spot and let it stay there for three days.
And then place a covering cloth, soaked in vinegar, over the spot and let it stay there until the scar of the fire is destroyed. And then cure the spot with a four-herb ointment until it is healed.
And they said that when the wound remains open, the sooner you do it, the better and more effective it is.
And some of them said that the jawbone should be cauterized into the bone, and the cautery should be kept until some part of the specificity of the bone is revealed.
And then scrape off what has been adjusted to the bone, and it will be cured.
And others said that with the cautery, you should press hard on the bone until it cracks, and this is the form of little alpha: And they believe that from that spot, the vapors of the head will be released.
And the wound should be kept open for a long time, and then it should be cured until it is consolidated.
But to me, these two species of cauterization are not visible at all, except in certain men according to the way of fear; and I leave it, as you must know, better for health, when it is so; because the head has been revealed through the solution of continuity of it, just like we have testified in other members, and most especially when the patient's head is of a frightful nature.
And the first species of cauterization is more saved and better for me; and from that, health comes with that work.
Second Chapter.
On Cauterization of the Head.
When in all the head there occurs chronic and long-lasting pain, and this is prolonged in the patient, and he uses gallstones and waxes and capillaries and emplasters and poultices and cadels and gualinas and similar things, and most especially if it has already been cauterized with one cautery which has not profited him at all, then consider whether the head of the patient is strong in its nature; and if it is not frightful and finds a great cold, then cauterize another cautery over that one, leaving a little space. And then cauterize it on the crown of his head with a cautery until the jawbone is divided. Cut open the jawbone and reveal the quantity of bone that we have recounted, and then cauterize it with a cautery on the back part of the head in the location which is called the "vas", -- and it is that location where the windpipe is situated. And let go of your hand in this way, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient will experience a great deal of pain that is different from the pain caused by all other head cauterizations.
And you will say this cautery in its place, for it is the one with which we cauterize the crowns of the head and the occiput is more subtle than that which is cauterized at the middle point of the head; and this is its form.
Third Chapter.
On Cauterization of Migraine Not Antiquated.
When the patient suffers from headache or pain in the head, or when pain spreads to the eye, he should be purged with medicines that clear the head, and other treatment should be administered, as I have said in the divisions of diseases; and if this does not help, then cauterization is done in two ways: either by using a sharp medicine combined with a cutting substance, or by using iron.
But the cauterization with a combining medicine is when you take a piece of aloes, and scrape it off, and cut off the extremities of both heads. And then incise the location of the pain in the temple with a well-sharpened lancet until it makes a small opening just behind the jawbone, so that it is hidden.
And then place a compress on it, and let it be held in place by gentle pressure, and leave it for the space of three hours; and then remove the compress and treat the aloes, and let the wound remain open for two or three days, and then place a covering cloth soaked in vinegar over it until the spot becomes numb.
And then cure that with an ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some combining medicines that I have written about in the two treatises on combining medicines.
But the cauterization with iron according to this method: ignite it for a cautery, and this is its form:
and it is called "claus clavilhs", because the head of it is shaped like a clove in which there is some curvature, and in the middle part of it is a small prominence.
And then place it on the spot of pain, and hold your hand steady - so that the cauterization is not ruined which has been left behind - and slowly move the iron with speed.
And if the quantity of blood that is revealed by the specificity of the bone is equal to the majority of it, and lift your hand high enough so that the artery which has been left behind is not injured, lest a flow of blood come.
And then soak the cloth in saltwater and place it on the spot, and let it stay there for three days; and then remove the cloth soaked in vinegar, and cure with an ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize at the end of the cutting instrument according to the cautery, and beware of incision of artery in this non-antiquated migraine.
Fourth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Antiquated Migraine.
When you cure migraine with what we have said about the previous treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and if the treatment does not help, and at times the disease does not respond to what we have said about the first cauterization with medicine or with fire, then it is necessary that you ignite the cutlery cautery until it becomes white, because you mark on the spot of pain with a line of length equal to the majority of the digit, or where it is; and then hold your hand steady for a moment and press hard until you incise the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuity of the mandible, which is affected by mastication, and that the ligament is not injured and the nerves which are connected to it, lest there be a spasmodic movement.
And if it is on the custody and caution of the flow of blood from the artery that is being cut, because in the cutting of it there is fear, and most especially for one who ignores what he is doing and has not studied or practiced; and leave the operation to begin with.
And you will find in the memory of this book, the regulation of the flow of blood in an emergency situation, according to your own method, in this same location of this book.
And if you see that this disease does not respond to this cauterization and you see the patient's body is tolerant, then cauterize it in the middle point of the head just as we have recounted, and cure the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have said in the chapter on cutting with two knives, and it is a better and more suitable cautization.
Fifth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Earaches.
When in the ear there is pain due to cold and it has been treated with laxative causes and other treatments which I have said in the divisions, and yet the pain does not subside, then ignite the cautery, and this is called "puncta", of which this is its form:
And then bring the point close to the ignition, and let it be carried around the entire ear just like a wheel is revolved, or in the circle of each example if the pain is in one. Stretch yourself with the cautery of the root of the ear little by little until you have marked the location with intent.
And if the cautery of ten points is done all over the ear, and in each one, and then cure the spots until they are healed.
Sixth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Torture.
Torture which is cured and with cauterization is not but of the species which come from phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the species that proceeds from dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you cure that species of torture with herbs and capillaries and guarguarismes, and your treatment does not bring relief, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one on the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the conjunction of two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part, because only mollification occurs in the part that appears to be healed.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize with the cautery on the right side of the extremity of the ear, a little above the crown of the head, and in the temple another one, whose length is according to the length of the thumb's pace, and then hold your hand steady with the cautery until the quantity of the majority of the bone's specificity is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a species of the cutlery, whose form is set before us. But even more subtle is that it must be done just a little bit as you see it; and it is necessary to trim away the excessive roughness a little.
And then cure the spot with water that is before us, until it is healed.
Seventh Chapter.
On Cauterization of Antiquated Apoplexy.
When apoplexy is antiquated and you cure it with the water we have said and your treatment does not bring relief, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize it with four cauteries: on all the crowns of his head; and at the middle point of the head, just as we have said; and at the nape. And the method of the cautery is done according to what has been said above.
And it is cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is the most recent; and then be cured with water that proceeds.
Eighth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Oblivion made by Flame.
Take great herbs and pills of the service that clears the mind, and give them to the patient at the beginning.
And then shave the entire head of the patient and place on the nape of it an ointment described in the treatise on ointments.
And leave it for several times, because that is the method of cautery. And do so according to the order which I have said above.
And therefore, if it is not healed by those means; and then, may three cauteries be done in the back part of his head, which are descendants of the highest part of the head down to the lowest part of the neck. And then pause between each cautery for the length of a thumb's pace, and cure the cautery with water that has proceeded.
But if you wish to add more and the patient is water-tolerant, then do the cautery in the middle point; and if you wish for even greater addition, then cauterize it over both crowns.
And then cure that until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form given above.
Ninth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Paralysis and Mollification of the Entire Body.
Take care to process in mollification of the head with herbs and water as we have said; and then shave the head of the patient, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle point of the head, and with a cautery on all the crowns of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the disease of mollification of the body of many and the patients are tolerant and the disease is strong, then cauterize it with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and gradually with one cautery until it is burned from the bone to the skin, and lift your hand high. And then cure that until it is healed, and this be an olive-shaped cautery.
Tenth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Epilepsy.
No is it cauterized the epilmetic, but that epilepsy is due to phlegm.
And therefore, take care to mollify the brain of him at the beginning with herbs and other treatments which we have said in the division, when the patient is great and tolerant, except for the medicines.
And if it is an infant who does not tolerate medicines, then administer guarguarismes and mastiguationary foods that serve to mollify the brain, before this for several days, with good nourishment of food.
And then shave the head of the patient, and then cauterize it with one cautery in the middle point of the head according to the previous method, and another cautery on the back part of the head, and on each crown of the head, may it be cauterized. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize it with the cauteries which I say, having paralyzed and mollified the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped according to what has been said above.
But if the patient is an infant, then pause with a subtle cautery according to this method.
Eleventh Chapter.
On Cauterization of Melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted and moist, then cauterize it with the cauteries which we have said in the having paralyzed.
And if the cause of melancholy is superfluity that inclines to melancholy, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him to drink water that mollifies the brain of him according to what has preceded in the division.
And then shave the head of the patient, and then make a tortoise-shaped depression made from it on the circle, and then place that in the middle point of the head.
And let the patient be seated comfortably, and be held by all parties.
And then apply a poultice; and it is more worthy of an old sheep's board. And heat that over the fire with a tempered warmth by measure, which said it suffered when it was more in him. And then put that in the middle point of the head of him on the circle, and leave it until it is cooled down.
And do this with the patient for one week, with another regime of good in him until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize that making small points according to what is best for him, so that you hold your hand with a cautery thus ordered: this is a species of cautery which moistens the brain with equality.
And then put that wrapped in cloth or linen sheets.
Twelfth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Water Descending into the Vein.
When you are declared the beginning of water in the vein by the signs which I have said in the division, then begin and give to drink to the patient water that mollifies the head of him, and guard it from all moistures.
And put that in a bath with hot water for several days.
And then command him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle point of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on both temples if it is the beginning of water descending into two veins, or from one side if it is the beginning of water descending into one vein.
Cut all the veins and arteries that are below the bone; and let the cauteries be in that length on the latitude of the temples.
And beware of hemorrhages when it is cauterized; and if you see blood flowing from it, stop it with some medicine that is available to you.
And you will find wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and in the abscession of those and caution against blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized at the vertebrae below two bones with two cauteries gradually produced.
Thirteenth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Old Tears.
When tears from the eyes are old and stubbornly stuck, and through the veins and arteries that are in the manifest location of the head outside, and it is verified that this is superfluous cold and moist matter, then cauterize that with a cautery which we have recounted in the chapter on the beginning of water descending into the veins, and with a cautery in the middle point of the head and two cauteries at the vertebrae below the temples, and with two cauteries at the vertebrae below the bones. And if you need addition, then cauterize that on the entire length of the tail of the eye over the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Fourteenth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Bad Breath from the Nose.
When you treat that with water which we have said in the division and your treatment does not improve, then prepare and give to drink to the patient those chestnuts for three nights; and then shave the head of him, and cauterize it with a middle-shaped cautery and an olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize that with a clove-shaped cautery, and two cauteries on the two eyebrows below the hair, a little bit.
And beware of not cutting into the artery.
And from the clove-shaped cautery, this is the form.
Fifteenth Chapter.
On Cauterization for Mollification of Eyelids from the Eyes.
When the eyelid from the eye is mollified by disease or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery shaped like the moon; and this is the form of it:
And if you wish, cauterize that over the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on all sides, and be elongated from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the quantity of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery, but rather according to the quantity that the third part of the eyelid is adorned.
Sixteenth Chapter.
On Cauterization of the Eyelid from the Eye when Hairs are Converted to the Inner Parts and Puncture the Eye.
When the hairs of the eye are converted to the inner parts in such a way that they pierce the eye, then cauterize those with two methods, either by burning or by medicine combining.
If with a cautery of fire, command the patient before this that he may see his hairs in such a way as those which are mounded, until they are prolonged and equalized; and if it pierces that you must give him relief, then strengthen the eyes of him with one bandage so that it is not spoiled until the hairs are born.
Then when they are born and equalized, then pause the head of the patient in your seat, and then sign above the eyelid of the eyes of him with a tent, with a signal which is according to the figure of a leaf of mirth, and be the beginning of the signal near the hairs.
And then put that wrapped in an albumen of egg white or in a mucus of papyrus on the eye.
And then extinguish the cautery, the shape of which is as follows:
And then cauterize on the figure which is marked, little by little, in many times, until the surface of the bone which is like a leaf of myrtle, appears properly.
And the sign of health in this work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs of it being raised above the point of the eye.
And therefore raise your hand and leave that for three days, and then pause over it with a cloth until the scar is formed. And then cure that with an ointment until it is healed.
But if some cause returns to the hairs and they begin to be mollified again, then do another time the cautery on that in just the same way as you did initially.
But if the hairs are in the eyelid below, then cauterize that until it is elevated to its natural place and equalized, so that the hairs do not pierce the eye.
But the cautery with combining medicine is this: you command the patient to look at his hairs until they are prolonged and equalized, and then make a bandage of cloth in the shape of a leaf of myrtle.
And then take from known salt and living vinegar one ounce. The end! And therefore, or what is this, and then mix those causes well, and make it with a festination so that it is not cooled; and then spread out the water over the cloth which is made in the shape of a leaf of myrtle, and pause that on one eye or both eyes; and pause below the eye wrapped in albumen of egg white, and the head of the patient be in your seat.
And then pause the said on the medicine and press that a little and do not spoil it until the patient feels the biting of the medicine, for biting is in him as from fire.
And therefore, when the patient perceives that he can withstand biting, then cease giving the medicine and make it with your own words; therefore, when the biting ceases, then wash away the eye with water; and then consider if the eyelid is already raised as if it were washed by fire or by incision, for then all is well; and if not, return to that of the medicine on the location where the medicine was not applied and do not spoil it until your operation is equalized and the eye is contracted.
And then pause over it with a cloth until the bone of adjustment is eradicated, and then cure that with an ointment or another substance until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you to carefully observe your operation with diligent vigilance that the medicine does not fall into the eye, and if the eyelid is mollified after several days and some cause of the hairs pierces the eye, then iterate your medicine on that location which is mollified from the eyelid, and properly as you did at the beginning, and then guide it until it is healed.
And this is the shape of a leaf of myrtle. (This marks the end of the text)
And you should know that the eyes of men are diversified according to magnitude and smallness, and therefore according to this is made your contraction. (This suggests that the text is concluding with a note on the importance of individual variation in human physiology)
And let not the way of rectitude be hidden from him to whom it is studied in this art. (This suggests that the text is concluding with a note on the importance of following a righteous path in one's studies and practice of medicine)
Seventeenth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Fistula that is in the Lacrimal of the Eye.
When you cure fistula with the water which we have said in the divisions of diseases and it does not conform to your cure, then consider that you must cauterize that according to this manner: command the patient to place his head on his seat, and hold his head with some minister between those things so as not to be spoiled or agitated by his own head.
And then put that wrapped in an albumen of egg white or in a mucus of papyrus on the eye of him.
And then extinguish the cautery, the shape of which is as follows:
the shape of which is curved, like the form of a reed or a quill of a vulture, from one extremity to that at which the cautery was made.
And if you wish, be penetrating into the other extremity. And if you wish, be like a tent.
But in any case, that which is curved is better for the present work.
And then press on the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus and dry that. And if it is not open, then work on it and extract the hardening of it.
And then put the cautery on it which is well ignited, and take with that your hand a little, so that the cautery of the eye does not err or disturb the patient, and then pause the cautery in the whites of the eye and corrupt that.
And therefore, if at the beginning of your cautery it penetrates into the bone, well it is; and otherwise, then iterate the cautery one or two times, if necessary; and leave that thus for three days, and then pause over that with a cloth and surround it with an exsiccatious ointment until it is healed.
But if it has been passed 11 days and it is not healed, then pause over the sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered and shaved according to what is needed in your own capital.
And there is another method of cauterization for fistula which some people say: "Make a hole in the location of the fistula and then pause in that fine fissure, the shape of which is as follows: Fill that with one ounce of melted lead; and take your hand with caution and good retention, so that the patient is not disturbed because the melted lead does not reach the eye of him; and then pause over the eye of the patient wrapped in albumen of egg white or water, for lead adheres to the location of the fistula and heals it through wondrous healing."
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about cauterization and healing, well it is; otherwise, then it is necessary to administer a cut of the nose and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose according to where it comes from.
Eighteenth Chapter.
On Cauterization of the Fissure of the Pots.
Many times accidents happen to fissures in the lips, and most often on the lips of children.
Therefore, when you cure those fissures with the water which we have said in the divisions and your cure does not take effect, then ignite the cautery with a small cutlass according to this shape which is seen:
And be the curvature of it according to the subtlety of the cutlery.
Then pause that gently in those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then cure that with cerote until it is healed.
Nineteenth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Fistula in the Mouth.
When in the root of the uvula or on the palate or in the roots of the teeth, apostema arises and then bursts forth, and then becomes antiquated, and the burst forth and makes a fistula, and then you cure that and your healing does not take effect, then consider that you must ignite a cautery according to the quantity received in the fistula, and then put that ignited thing into the wound of the fistula, and take with that your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and at the end of it do so one or two times; and then cure that with water as we have said about healing, until it is healed.
And therefore, if the pus is discharged and it is healed, well it is; otherwise, then it is necessary to discover the location and expose the corrupted bone according to what comes from its own capital.
Twentieth Chapter.
On Cauterization of the Teeth and Softening of the Gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are spoiled, and you cure those with medicines but they do not concur, then pause the patient's head on your seat, and then ignite the cautery in the shape which will come about thusly, so that you pause the quill over the tooth and insert into it the hot iron quickly, and take with your hand a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching to the root of the tooth.
And then lift up your hand, and then iterate the cautery several times according to what you wish.
And then the patient will open his mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and afterwards stop it, for the spoiled tooth is closed and the softened gum is strengthened and the corrupted moisture is dried up.
Twenty-First Chapter.
On Cauterization of Toothache.
When toothache is caused by coldness, or in it is cold or warm, or does not concur with healing through medicine, then the cautery in that place is according to two methods: either a cauterization with cow's butter, or a cauterization with fire.
Cauteri with cow's butter is that you take the butter of cows and boil it in a metal vessel, and then take a cloth and wrap it around the extremity of the tent, and then immerse that with hot butter, and pause that over the painful tooth quickly until it is cooled.
And then iterate that several times until the virtue of fire reaches to the root of the teeth.
And if you wish, submerge a cloth or a piece of linen in the butter mentioned above, and pause that over the painful tooth, and then pause on top of it with hot iron until the iron reaches the bottom of the curvature of the tooth.
But in any case, the cauterization with fire is that you attend to the quill of iron or steel, and it should be in the heart of it some roughness, and the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
And then ignite the cautery in the shape which will come about, and pause that over the tooth and take with your hand until the cautery is cooled; and do so several times because the pain is removed or on that day or the next day.
And it is necessary for the patient to fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, and then stop it; and this is the form of the cautery.
And cauterize as you wish, extreme point, according to what is possible for you.
And this is the form of the quill:
Twenty-Second Chapter.
On Cauterization of Exostoses.
When exostoses arise from flesh and humors that are cold and not obedient to digestion by medicines, and you wish the digestion of those to be lightened, then you must ignite a cautery with a curved shape, having two extremities bulging so that the smoke of the cautery escapes through the other extremity, and pause that hot on that apostema once, or if needed again, until it reaches the bottom of the apostema.
And if the apostema is small, then pause the cautery according to the quantity of the apostema, and then leave it for three days and pause over it with a cloth wrapped in butter until what has been burned by the fire is removed.
And then cure that with an ointment, tents, and cloths until it is healed.
Twenty-Third Chapter.
On Cauterization of Hoarseness of the Voice and Constriction of Ale.
When the humors come out through the trachea of the lung, and especially when this is due to coldness of congestion, then it is necessary for the patient to be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and then cauterize that by fire in the root of the glottis in the affected location.
And take care not to reach with the cautery to the glottis nor burn too much of its code, but only a little.
And then cauterize that with another cautery, reaching the junction of the spine at the last vertebra of it. And the cautery should be like a nail, following the previous manner.
And then cure that with water as is preceded until it is healed.
Twenty-Fourth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Lung Disease and Cough.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humors and the patient does not have fever or chills, but is an old disease, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the furcula in the affected locations, one above and one below; and with another cautery in the middle location of the feet between two mamillae; and let the cautery be like a nail according to the previous shape.
And if you wish, be the punctate cautery with the punctae that is called puncta, in the shape which precedes in the punctation of earache.
And be points within those; and then cure that with water, putting it in the shape which is preceded until it is healed.
And now be the cautery with three ramps, whereof cauterization is in that: in one turn, you can do three cauteries according to this form:
Twenty-Fifth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Titillation, which is the head of the assistant.
When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to lubricating humors and does not settle in its normal position during the time of return, but rather moves slightly as if it were going to return to its former location, as we have testified, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation first, and then let the patient be reversed onto his back or onto his side; and then lift up the code which is in the posterior part of the citillic to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand if the juncture is dislocated towards the posterior.
And then ignite the cautery having two heads; and this is its shape:
And then cauterize the code until it penetrates into the other side; and the figure of cauterization will come forth with four cautery heads.
And some times it is adjusted according to this count, and because there are eight cauteries.
And then pause on the cautery with pores filled with salt, and then make the patient adhere to tranquility, and let the member not be spoiled for some time until it is comforted.
And if the dislocation is towards the upper parts and then it is done thus, then cauterize on the muscle with a nail-like cautery or punctate cauteries, because the juncture is confirmed and the humidity is removed and the patient is healed.
Twenty-Sixth Chapter.
On Cauterization of the Stomach.
When cold and many humors come into the stomach, which extrude from its natural constitution and are multiplied in it, and if you continue with the methods of healing and they do not concur, then it is necessary to make the patient lie on his back resupinated, and extend his arms and legs, and then cauterize that with three cauteries: one leaving a piece of the foot as long as a finger with a nail-like cautery, and two others leaving the ribs on either side of the cautery, so that the figure of a triangular cautery comes forth; and elongate between them so that they are not adjusted to make a poultice.
And if the depth of the cautery is equal to the quantity of the two thirds of the thickness of the cord.
And the figure of the cautery shall be according to this shape, plus addition; and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle location of the stomach according to this shape; and that is one cautery according to the shape of a circle according to this shape:
And be cauterized the stomach punctate to that which is frightened by this cautery: and it is that you sense on the stomach point according to the quantity that you wish with tent, and then cauterize that with a cautery in the points; and then cure that with the healing which precedes until it is healed.
Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
On Cauterization of the Fretful Foot.
When there is pain in the foot due to coldness or moisture or great swelling, and it is not in its normal state of constitution due to excessive discharge, and the patient is cured with water as we have said and does not concur, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back resupinated onto his headrests, and sense three cauteries according to this shape and quantity placed on the foot left of the hipbones, one for each side of the bed where the man lies.
And be the space between each cautery according to the thickness of the finger, and be the cauteries according to the length of the straight arm.
And do not compress your own with the moving cautery.
And if the quantity of water is equal to the quantity of the middle third of the cord's thickness, and not yet adjusted; and if the patient stands on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him lie down, the one who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
And if it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a cutlery-like cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And take care not to process too much in the cauterization, and be guided by the subtlety of all the cord so that it is guided throughout the body and penetrates into the vessels, for the cord here is subtle; and know this.
Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
On Perforation of an Aposteme on the Foot with a Cautery.
When there is excrescence or an aposteme on the foot and you wish to know if that aposteme is in the flesh of the foot or in the skin of it, then if it is in the flesh of the foot, the patient will suffer great gravity and pain without acuity.
And if it is in the skin of the foot, with great pain and sharpness, and often times that fatigues even the most skilled doctors in its cure.
Then it is necessary that the patient be turned over onto his headrest; and then sense the location of the aposteme with tent; and then ignite the cautery which is like a rag, in the shape which has preceded on the other page. And then cauterize with that same cautery until all the cord is consumed, until it reaches the ciphac, until in fact the wound is healed.
And then cure that with the healing of other apostemes until it is healed.
And it is not necessary that this form of cauterization be used by anyone other than one who has studied the art of medicine and has prolonged experience in many cases where various diseases have been known; but rather this one should be bold enough to attempt this operation, but yet leave it to us, and it will be better.
Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Pleurisy.
The ancient ones have said that the cautery of pleurisy is done in this manner: take a long and dry root of aristology, a pointed and long root that is found, and be of the thickness of a finger.
And then immerse that in oil and ignite it at the fire, and then cauterize with a cautery on that location which is between the continuation of the furcula and the spine; and with two small cauteries guiding, one slightly inclining towards the partition that is below the beard, and with two others declinating between the fifth rib and the cleft, declining slightly towards the posterior partitions; and with another cautery in the middle location of the foot; and with another over the stomach, and with three cauteries on the posterior partitions; and with one cautery on that location which is between the two shoulder blades, and with two cauteries from both sides of the foot, leaving the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
And it is not necessary that you compress your own hand with the cautery, but rather let it be in the manifest of the cord in work.
And some ancient ones have said that some men are so bold as to use a cautery of iron resembling a ray and ignite it, and place it on the location which is between the ribs, until it reaches that aposteme and cleans out the wound, just as we have said in the aposteme of the foot.
But in this perforation with a cautery, there is no fear, for whoever does so soon finds that it happens in the location of the fistula to which there is no healing.
Thirtieth Chapter.
On Cauterization of the Mole.
When you cure the disease of the mole with water as we have said in the division and do not concur with your own cure, then cauterize it thus: according to three manners, all of which are right, one of which is that you make three or four lines along the length of the mole, following the figure of the cauteries of the foot, the figure of which has preceded.
And be the thickness between each cautery that of a finger or a little more, and the manner of the cautery be the manner which we have said in the cautery of the foot equally.
And do not compress your own hand with the cautery; and let the patient lie on his back.
And there is another manner of cauterizing, so it is that you ignite the cautery having two vertices, which cause we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the muscle, and lift up the cord which is in the endright of the mole, where the patient's left side lies.
And be your elevation that which lifts up the cord according to the length of the body, so that the cauteries may be made according to the latitude of the body.
And then insert the two vertices, ignite one, into that place where with those you will pierce the cord of the other side.
And then extract the cautery; and thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three vertices.
And then cure the cautery more than it has laid there to get rid of bad breath for many days, because it is more certain that other causes precede in the cure.
Thirty-First Chapter.
On Cauterization of Hydrocephalus.
Cauteries are not applied to hydrocephalus, but rather to a proper and distinct condition.
When you cure the hydrocephalus with the methods of healing which we have said in the division and do not concur with your own cure, then it is necessary that you cauterize with four cauteries in a circle around the belly button, one on the stomach, one on the foot, one on the mole, two between the vertebrae of the back, one on the right side of the leg, and another on the stomach. And the quantity of the depth of the cautery should be proportioned to the subtlety of the cord.
And then leave the cautery untouched for so long that bad breath will persist for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient of healing near the cautery with water as is necessary for two purposes, and thus hasten to him with the aid of healing.
The shape of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized is nail-like, according to the form which precedes it above, and that with which the back is cauterized is olive-like, according to its preceding shape.
Thirty-Second Chapter.
On Cauterization of Feet and Legs.
When the feet are apostemated with dropsy and filled with stagnant water, it is necessary that you cauterize the feet on the top of the ankle in a circular motion with water which is between the auricular and anular joints, and lift up your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; and then lift up your hand and do not return it to its original position, for the stagnant water rebels.
It is the cautery in this form: And then make two cauteries on both legs, and on each leg be made a cautery at the extremity of the cutlery-like cautery. And be the cauteries according to the length of the leg: one on top and another on the lower part of the leg; and two cauteries on each leg.
And leave the wound open without healing for a long time, in order that some water may flow from it.
And then cure with those causes which we have said.
Thirty-Third Chapter.
On Cauterization of Abdominal Wounds.
When the abdominal wound is caused by cold and moisture, so that the vertebrae are weakened, it is necessary to exhibit the digestive and retentive virtues in the stomach and intestines; and if the patient does not concur with their own cure, and sometimes suffers from a cautery of virtue, then cauterize it with a great cautery on his stomach, according to what has preceded in the cautery of the stomach, with the circular cautery and four subtle cauteries in a circle around the navel, with a nail-like subtle cautery; or with two cauteries.
And if sometimes the humors abound and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize it over the navel and intestines, and adjust two cauteries closely over the stomach and near the inguinals, for this is perfect healing which will not err.
Thirty-Fourth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Old Hemorrhoids.
When old hemorrhoids or one of the thick humors, cold or corrupted moisture, are in nature, and are cured with water as we have said in the division, and do not concur with their own cure, then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower back, just above the small triangular bone, and with one cautery above the navel, which falls between two vertebrae.
And if you find that the patient's stomach is chilled and his food not digested, and his face repeatedly apostemated, then cauterize it on the stomach with a great cautery according to what has preceded; and one cautery on the foot, and another cautery on the mole of him with a nail-like cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then cure him so that he may be healed.
Thirty-Fifth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Ate in the Absence of Their Abscesses.
When you abscessed atehel, then you ignite the cautery that is likened to a ray. And then insert that ignited thing into the abscessed atehel, and finally lift up your hand so that the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows.
And make this once or twice, for if the atehel are many, then cauterize each of them according to what we have recounted, and finally cure those with water that concur with their own healing so that it may be healed.
And if you cauterize with a great cautery on someone, it is more effective in healing.
Thirty-Sixth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Fistulas that are formed in the natural orifices of the body.
When nature does not obey the work which we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by this, then cure him with a cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in the natural orifice, and it is old, filled with pus and corrupted moisture, and therefore what is most worthy of being done is to probe that fistula with a subtle tenta, and then know the quantity of its depth according to the previously mentioned tenta.
And then ignite the cautery which is like a ray. And then place that ignited cautery into this fistula, and according to the quantity which the tenta enters.
And repeat that action with the cautery into those corrupted bodies until they are burned away at once or twice or three times, according to the quantity of your necessity.
And beware of burning the nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes to the bladder or intestines, then beware of all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy location that does not penetrate.
And then cure the location so that it may be healed.
And if the location is sealed, and the matter has abscessed from it, and remains thus for a long time, then know that it is now fully healed.
And if the matter is not removed from there, then know that it is penetrating or has corrupted in the precursory stage of the patient's body, or falls into those causes of which a reminder will be made in its location.
Thirty-Seventh Chapter.
On Cauterization of Tonsils.
When in the tonsils there is pain due to cold or great ventilation, and thereby the patient's throat is rendered rough, then it is necessary that you cauterize that on the tonsils with a cautery on each tonil with a nail-like cautery of which the remembrance precedes.
And then cauterize again with a little bit less, so that three lined cauteries will come, and therefore they will be more effective in healing.
Thirty-Eighth Chapter.
On Cauterization of the Bladder.
When debilitation and mollification occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture, such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that on the lower part of the bladder, where the hair of the navel begins, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side and another on the left side.
And be the length of each cautery according to the quantity of the notes of the foot; and cauterize that with a cautery on the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if it is necessary.
And be the cautery nail-like according to what has been processed.
Thirty-Ninth Chapter.
On Cauterization of the Armpit.
When cold and moisture come to the armpit, and because of this engorgement is prohibited, and the menstrual flows are corrupted, and the stimulation of them is delayed, and pains occur in their suppression, then it is necessary that the location be cauterized with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, just as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the lowest part of the back, or two cauteries, and let the cautery be nail-like.
Fortieth Chapter.
On Cauterization of Dislocation of the Hip.
When moisture and mucus are effused to the part of the hip, and such causes are produced in the swelling of that location, and a sign of it is that the leg is prolonged over the other when they are compared between them. And the location of the dislocation is found in the way the joint is bent.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the part of the hip with a circular cautery similar to a ring, as you have sensed with a tenta in the circle of that part, and because the part falls in the middle location of the circle.
And be the cautery of which the form preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not at your present location, then cauterize that with three cauteries and a great olive-like cautery.
And be the cautery made according to the quantity of the subtlety of all the cord; and then cure that so that it may be healed.
Forty-First Chapter.
On Cauterization of the Sciatic Nerve.
When pain comes to the part of the hip, and its cause is cold and moisture, the patient is cured with water as we have said and does not concur, and this is old, then it is necessary that you remove the patient's thick humors with fetid pills or artificial pills or similar ones; and then cauterize that.
And the method of the cautery in that is according to two methods: or a cautery with burning medicines, or a cautery by fire.
There are two scientific methods, one of which is to cauterize that on the part of the hip of him with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and make good depth in those. And be the spaces between each cautery the quantity of the thickness of that digit, and if it is an olive-like or great cautery.
Sometimes, the cautery may be on the middle location above the head of the hip, so that there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle of which the form is preceded in the cauterization of the hip dislocation, that is to say, a contained and burning circle that consumes the subtlety of all the cord.
And this is the method of cautery for sciatica when pain adheres to the hip and does not spread into the joint.
But if it spreads into the joint, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the joint, on the location where the patient feels the pain; and with one cautery on the femur for about four digits from the hairy part.
And if the cautery is cutaneous, and be the depth of the cautery according to the quantity of the subtlety of the cord.
And if the patient says that the pain is spread to the location near the tips of the toes, then cauterize that where you feel it with a cautery for three points or four or more if necessary.
And if the patient says that pain is left below the kneecap and goes to the joint, then cauterize that with one cutaneous cautery.
And be careful in all cautery that you do not end with the cautery until it burns nerves or great vessels, and because of this, you may bring harm to your patient or cause contraction.
And you have already seen one and another of those which I would cauterize on the femur and finally in the cautery, and the inflamed fire burning into the toe until the tumor reaches the end, and the perforated and corrupted fire that consumes all the toe. And then a sudden solution of the belly, and thus death follows.
And if the pain is in two parts together, cauterize each one according to this method.
And the wise men say that in the cauterization of the hip, this is the method: make it similar to a circle of iron with a circuit equal to half a palm; and be the size of its orifice according to the thickness of an almond bone or less.
And inside that circle be another third; and be the spaces between them the quantity of the notes of the foot; and let those circles be above two parts; and let their length be one or two notes, and make in those margins of iron decently apparelled within the circles; and this is the form of it:
And then ignite it in the fire until it reddens and gives sparks, and then pause above the part of the hip, the patient lying on his side. And therefore cauterize that with three circular cauteries in a single pass.
And then leave that for three days, and apply an ointment to it with a border, and leave the wound open for many days; and then cure that with remedies until it is healed.
Thus ends Albucasis: Oh, sons, we have used this type of cautery little, due to the fear of looking at it, and because few have found those who look upon it.
But from the good effects of these cauteries on him who suffered them, and he found the location of the spot with that.
But the cautery with burning medicines is that which you make two circles having an armula perforated in which they will be the guaffo of the door of iron; and let the length of the walls in their height be two notes or what those are.
And if the spaces between which are equal to the quantity of the thickness of that digit; and let them be above and below, and let them contain themselves between them according to this form:
And then pause above the part of the hip where the patient lies on his side, and press your hand upon the part of the hip; and then take cold water and pour it between two circles, and let its quality be mixed with small fire, and hold that for the quantity of one hour, and suffer the patient to endure the stinging and the adjustment of the location — until that stinging is like a burning from fire.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe away the cold water from all of the hip with lukewarm water.
And then leave that for three days and pause above that border until the blackness of the adjustment is restored, and leave that too for some days, and the patient will recover; this is the final in healing.
And then cure that with remedies until it is healed.
And if the pain is extended into the joint or the thigh, make it in such a way that it contains water according to how it is made in the hip similarly.
And this is the method of cold water, and you have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Recipe for alkaline and non-extinguished causes in both hips, one on each side of the body; crush them and pause in a new vessel from which the left part is pierced with a small hole, according to the quantity that enters the ray.
And then pause the bottom of one vessel in another inverted vessel, and place above that alkaline and living causes with lukewarm water which absorbs them by one finger, and compress them with your thumb to good compression, and leave the vessel to descend from it sharp water into the left part of the inverted vessel.
And then adjust all that water, and place it above another living cause and another alkaline substance renewed, for that which is said to be of great force is administered in many operations of medicine and in the cauterization of other members, for operation makes fire.
And some medicines which are cauterized on the wide part, such as terra zizzic and manna crocata, and causes mixed with sawing in a way that they are blended.
And Galen recounts the story of a man from ancient times who underwent an operation and cure for hip and sciatic vein pain, and magnificently declared it to be of great benefit, saying that there was no need for another cure, and thus he was healed in one pass just as recommended, because very quickly he entered into a bath and exercise, already knowing the efficacy of that.
And it is said that the patient was pressed with a certain type of verdure, and if not green, then fresh figs; and much was crushed with a little gray matter and placed above the hip where the pain is located, or in the joint, or in the thigh, and bound.
And then left for the quantity of three hours or for the quantity that the patient consents to adjustment.
And then placed him in a bath and thus when his body was warmed up, placed him on the sun, for the pain ceased and he was healed.
And know that it is not good to use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
But already Esculapius said that when the sciatic vein is cut by a goat's hoof, it is cauterized on him too; and let the cautery be with him according to this method: take wool and soak it in ancient oil, and place it between the toes of the foot and between the bones.
And then take a dried goat's hoof and infuse it with fire until it becomes carbonized; and then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is stretched. And then repeat this process, and do not cease to do so until the sensation of the stinging reaches the hip and the pain is relieved.
And this method of cautery is called the "cauteri de vaquas".
Chapter XLII.
On the Cauterization of Pain in Two Places.
Sometimes pain is in both places due to numerous causes, such as bruising or striking or excessive evacuation, and similar causes by infusion of wet and humid matter.
And cautery is not used except in this single species which is made by effusion of moist matter.
Therefore, it is good to evacuate the patient with foul-smelling pills and similar ones, which are made on both places where the pain is located three lines according to their latitude, plus or minus, depending on the quantity that appears from the tolerance of the patient and its virtue.
And then make a cautery with a point-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four point-shaped cauteries or with a single medial claw-shaped cautery according to this form:
Chapter XLIII.
On the Cauterization at the Beginning of Goutiness.
Many times this disease attacks small children; and the sign of its onset in children is that it occurs on their tenderness in the ankle, causing elevation and movement.
And then it appears in the last vertebra of the spine and in the joints of one's fingers which already begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And then when you see this and wish to prevent it, cauterize that with a circle-shaped cautery according to this form: that takes the cautery on all parts of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize in the circle of the vertebra with a point-shaped cautery two or three lines. And let the points be proper between them.
And then cure the location until it is healed with this method that we have said.
But beware, for cautery should not be administered in goutiness caused by spasms of nerves.
Chapter XLIV.
On the Cauterization of Podagra and Joint Pain.
When joint pains are caused by wet and humid humors that are absorbed into each member of the body, it is customary for doctors to call this condition "podagra" properly.
And therefore, when podagra caused by wet and humid humors is cured through a method of cure and the pains do not subside, then the pains are relived with a cautery.
And so you cauterize that area with evacuation in the circle of the joint of the foot, using many cauteries.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, with this being its form:
And if it is necessary to make a puncture on the sole of the foot, then make it with a point-shaped cautery. And if the pains rise to the knuckles or to other joints, and many times they attack, then cauterize that on each knuckle with three or four point-shaped cauteries of all parts with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are needed as these cauteries are to you necessary, then cauterize that and do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery before, but only slightly around the circumference of the cord.
And if the pains rise to the knuckle and the spine, then administer the cautery which we have said in its own chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands alone, and is called "suagra", then puncture in the circle of the fingernails as they revolve, puncturing two lines.
And if the pains remain in the said places, then puncture in the circle of the fingernails on each finger and on the joint of the hand.
And if the pains rise near to certain days on the joints or muscles, then cauterize all of them on every part of the auxiliary help.
And do not evacuate the patient without good regimen and reception of medicines, for if there is good regimen and phlegm is evacuated with this cautery, then it will be healed, God help.
Chapter XLV.
On the Cauterization of Wounds.
When an open wound appears on the thighs and says that the abscesses are forming before the navel at the groin, and this is the beginning of the process, it is good to instruct the patient to leave their diet for a day and to use gentle causes so that the wound will heal from its own warmth.
And then follow the patient with your hands on their back over their spine, and command them to keep their arm bent until a hole is made or the abscess appears.
And then return that with your fingers, and search by touch the rupture on the bone of the pelvis at the sign of its extremity which is similar to half a circle at the upper parts of the chest.
And then take the cautery-shaped instrument with this being its form:
until it is very red and has small sparks. And then reduce the abscess or the swelling to its natural state, and place your hand on the location so that the abscess does not burst.
And you have already put between the joints of the patient and left one joint, and another serves on his thighs, and another on his feet, which has its own hands.
And then place the cautery on that spot with your hand holding the instrument straight, and cause that to reach the bone of the pelvis into the middle of the duodenum; and repeat that procedure if you have not succeeded in the first attempt into the bone.
And observe carefully the sign of the abscess at the time of your cautery, that you may not burn that abscess for fear that it would cause harm or great evil to the patient.
And know that when you apply the cautery, do not touch the bone, nor confuse your operation.
And it is good to note that the cautery for children should be subtle according to their size and measure.
And then cure the location of the cautery for three days with a border, until the scar of the fire is restored.
And then cure that with the other remedies until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for 40 days, until the location and wound are sealed.
And it is good to note that the patient's nourishment should be adjusted according to the length of time for their healing, and that the abscess does not burst forth from the effort of recovery.
And then, when it is time to lift after 40 days, instruct them to do so decently and maintain that for another 40 days.
And let them moderate their labor and replenishment of food and drink, and violent speech, for when they use this regimen of entire healing, it will be healed.
And you should say that the healing of ruptures in other parts of the belly is as follows: at first, and wanting to do so, then cauterize the rupture with a red-hot cautery according to its quantity, and it will be excreted from the cord just like the third part of it; and then cure it with what we have said, and it will not be adjusted.
And some earlier ones had said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this form, since it is indicated by touch:
and a straight line that runs along the latitude on the flank above the rupture, and another line below; and then place your hand with a claw-shaped cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter XLVI.
On the Cauterization of Hiccups.
When an open wound appears on some member due to bruising or striking, and that pain persists for a long time and does not yield to cure with medicines, then it is good to cauterize with a point-shaped cautery.
And let the cautery be on every member according to its magnitude and smallness, virtue and vice of it, location of hiccups and pain of it.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, well; and otherwise, then repeat the cautery on the member; for it is customary with those pains to be punctured in a member unto that member which approaches it, so that you should succeed with that cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter XLVII.
On the Cauterization of Leprosy.
Some lepers have been cured with cautery due to great benefit, and especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putridity of phlegm and melancholy.
And therefore, when you wish to cauterize that, consider whether the leprosy is common and has been cured with what we have said in the division and does not decay, nor stand, and fear for the patient that corruption may comprehend all the body of him and all the complexity of him, then cauterize that on the head with two cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second a little below, above the forehead to the end of the hair; and both on the ears; and one behind, on the neck or services.
And finally, place your hand with the cautery a little on the bone to make a small impression, and from there, displace the scabs, so that the expiration of thick vapors may be alleviated from him; and cauterize on the malastrum according to what is necessary.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient's body and appears manifestly, then it is good that you cauterize him with those cauteries which we have said on the head; and one cautery on the tip of the nose, and two on both elbows, and two on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the vertebrae near the coccyx, and one on the coccyx, and two on each ankle, and one on each toe, and two on each knee, and two on each thigh, and two on each calf; and cauterize him on all the joints of his fingers and toes, and on each heel of his feet.
And be careful not to burn the nerves that are over the bone, lest you harm them.
And some times it is cauterized with one cautery on the bone of the pelvis and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the bladder.
And know that the more you adjust the cauteries, the more beneficial and the more conformable it is; and know that the patient does not have pain in the cautery, just like his own, because the body of him is already stupified.
And it is good that the cauteries are great or small according to the members and joints, as preceded by the species of instruments.
And then cure the cautery with fine flour from old wheat, mixed with honey and other healing substances, until it is healed.
Chapter XLVIII.
On the Cauterization of Stupor.
When some member is stupified or asleep and is cured with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you should cauterize that member which is stupified with cauteries according to its magnitude or smallness.
And let your cautery enter the consistency of the cord a little. And then cure that with a gentle remedy until it is healed.
And some times it is cauterized some stupor which appears on the limbs and feet, and on the vertebrae of the back, and when the sensation of the nerves which move that member is restored, the stupor is restored.
But do not presume on this unless you are knowledgeable in the anatomy of the members and the exit of the nerves throughout the entire moving body.
Chapter XLIX.
On the Cauterization of White Spots that is Mole.
When white spots are ancient and do not yield to any of the remedies of medicine, then you should cauterize on that with a preheated cautery for a little while according to the quantity of the specific quality of the cord until the whiteness and color of it are restored, and the color of it is changed.
And then cure that with fine flour from old wheat and lentils, mixed with roasted oil and leaves of hawthorn, and with the blood of dove or the blood of pigeon, each one being a part and all being mixed together; and then apply a linen cloth over the location and leave it there until it is healed.
Chapter L.
On the Cauterization of Gout.
When gout is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize that with a circular cautery in the circle of it just as it revolves.
And the wise ones say that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle location; but I have not seen this, for I fear that it may ulcerate, and I have already seen this some times.
And it is better to be cauterized in the circle of it with a circular cautery just as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter LI.
On the Cauterization of Bruises.
When some bruises are delayed in maturation, and it is so because of the superfluity causing that, or because of the condition of the patient, which is old and decrepit, with little blood, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of bruises; then cauterize in the circle of it with many small puncture-like cauteries; and then leave it alone until it fastens in maturation.
But if you wish to puncture it with the cautery, then take the cautery of which this is the shape and form; and place that in the middle location of the bruise until it penetrates the cord.
And if the cautery in that location is more below, because the body of the arm is alleviated; and then cure it until it is healed.
Chapter LII.
On the Cauterization of Corrosion.
Corrosion is a walking corruption in the member, which eats away at it just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you wish to cure that corrosion in the location where it is suitable for a cautery with fire, then take many small and large claw-shaped cauteries according to what is convenient in that location where the corrosion is.
And then cauterize that completely on all sides until you eradicate all the corrosion and there remains no cause of it.
And then leave that alone for three days, and pause on the locations that were cauterized with a mixture of oil and turpentine until all the scars are eradicated and all the corruption is gone.
And then cure that with gentle remedies producing flesh.
But if after three days the flesh grows back healthy in which there is no corruption, well; but if not, then repeat the cautery on that which remains in the corrupted locations.
And corrosion is cured with sharp medicine after some times, because it is mixed with a location of cautery. But however, the cautery with fire is of greater benefit.
And I have already said the cure for it with sharp medicine in the division, and therefore take that when you will need it.
Chapter LIII.
On the Cauterization of Knots and Other Similar Ones.
Many times knots appear on the parts left behind of a sick foot which is called a knot, and it is a big, thick cause that lames the foot; and cautery in those places is done according to two methods, either with fire or with hot water.
But the cautery with fire is when you ignite the cautery cone-shaped like a vulture's beak, which is made of iron according to the quantity that contains the knot of all parts, and it has fine margins.
And then pause that ignited thing over the knot, and then move your hand with the cautery in the circle of the knot until the cautery penetrates to the depth of the knot. And then leave that alone for three days until it begins to grow back. And then apply that with wild marigold leaves mixed with salt, and leave the poultice on that for one night, because that will eradicate the roots of it.
And then cure that location with gentle remedies producing flesh until it is healed.
And if it does not convert, and many times it happens on the surface of the body, mostly on the arms and legs, then you should administer in those cases cautery with water; and that is when you take a quill or iron or vulture's beak-shaped instrument, and place it over the knot; and then pour into the quill a small amount of hot water, and hold your hand, and turn that with compression of your hand all around, and press the margin of the quill into the root of the knot, and let the hot water flow through the preon of the root of the cauldron; and wait for the patient to endure the burning of the hot water for an hour, and then remove it, because the knot with its roots will be eradicated.
And thus do the same for those and then leave the other, until you come to all of them in their place within the body.
And then cure those places where the roots of the knots are eradicated with remedies that produce flesh, as the skin begins to grow back.
Chapter LIV.
On the Cauterization of Trembling.
When someone has a tremor due to some sort of irritation in the nerves or due to fever caused by irritation, or for another similar reason, then it is good that you cauterize that with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra with one cautery; and with a cautery in the feet of him, and on the stomach of him, with an olive-shaped cautery.
And the trembling of him ceases and hastens the healthiness of the sick person who was irritated.
Chapter LV.
On the Cauterization of Accidental Bruises on the Body.
When accidental bruises appear on the body and pustules split open which are made of gross corrupted matter; then it is good at the beginning, as appears, that it should be cauterized with a subtle cautery made from the wood of myrtle, the extremity of which is extended by fire; or with long-lasting erestological roots; or with lentecular cauteries.
And sometimes it is good to cauterize again at the beginning of its expulsion according to this method; and you should not doubt, and it is disrupted by the removal of those things, and cures from those.
But however, it is good that this should be done with proper evacuation through phlebotomy.
Chapter LVI.
On the Cauterization of Accidental Bloodletting through Incision of Arterial Flux.
Many times arterial flux appears which is to be incised from the wound that needs to be drained, or from the incision of apostemes or cauteries on the member, and thus it resembles, and it is difficult to restore that.
Therefore, as it happens to some, then you should take a stick with your hand at the orifice of the artery, and place it over that which your said endic strengthens that many times until the flow of blood is stopped from what your said, and there is no more.
And then pause in the fire, small and large olive-shaped cauteries by number, and blow over them until they are made hot.
And then take one small or large one according to the location and wound where the artery is broken, on that vein which is more fervent than you have restored your said, and apply the cautery until it is cauterized and restrained that blood.
And if the blood is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you apply your said and take away the cautery, then take another cautery carefully from those which are prepared in the fire, and thus do not cease to do this repeatedly until the blood is restrained.
And beware that you do not burn the nerves which are here, and that you come to the patient with another evil.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to restrain the blood in those cases, and especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four methods: or with a cautery as we have said before, or through extraction which is not extracted, because when it is extracted, the extremities of it are burned and the blood is restrained, or that it be tied with a thread or ligament by strong stretching, or that they be placed on him medicines whose virtue is to restrain the blood; and be strengthened with poultices and constriction in a decent manner.
But he who administers restraint decently with ligaments and strong stretching and cloths or by position of burning causes and similarities, does not yield until later.
But if this happens to someone and there is no doctor present or medicine, then work with the pause of the said indication on the orifice of that vein just as we have said, and understand the great constriction of it until the blood is stopped from the superior part of the wound, and above the artery the said is not restored; and above the artery be sprinkled with hot water of great coldness so that the blood is congealed and thickened; and further consider whether there is a need for cautery or medicine.
On the Incision and Perforation and Ventoses and Phlebotomy and Wounds and their Similarities.
We have already said in the first chapter all the illnesses in which cautery with fire is suitable and necessary medicine, and the occasions and causes of them, and the instruments needed in those cases along with the shapes of the cauteries; and we have arranged the chapters from the head to the feet.
And you will proceed in this chapter by that same manner, so that the one seeking this may be assisted with what he has asked for.
And before you begin this, dear son, it is good that you learn that in this chapter it is for fear what is in the first chapter of cautery.
And therefore it is good that there be great caution, for in the operation which is in this chapter many times evacuation occurs which is with blood and in which the life depends on the sprinkling of the vein or incision on the apostema or warning of existence or purging of the wound or extraction of sagetta or incision of pectoral and their similarities. And among all those, fear and trembling accompany them, and in the most of their cases, death.
And you are warned that this should not fall upon you, for sometimes the case demands ways of men with many diseases. And among them are those who depart with their own illness and it is light for him to die, and thus by the vehemence of that which he finds in his illness, and by the length of the illness of him, and with the illness is fear which means death.
And among them are those who give you their own advice and counsel, you hoping for health, and his own illness is pernicious.
And therefore it is not good that you consent to what comes to you from which this manner comes; and your caution should be greater than covetousness and rapacity; and do not presume any cause over this except aprop science certain which verifies this for you, and through which succession of praiseworthy things.
And use in the cure of all your own illnesses prophetic indication and guidance from which salvation is converted, for in that is aid to you on acquisition of fame and memory, praise and glory.
Oh, sons, God inspires His understanding in you and does not withhold direction and protection from you, for this is in His hand.
And you have arranged this chapter distinct by chapters according to what preceded in the chapter of cauteries, from the cure of the head to the feet, so that it may be a relief to you for what you ask for and which you need.
Chapter One.
On the Cure of Water Which is Contained in the Head of Children.
Know that this illness often occurs in children during childbirth, and when the umbilical cord tightens on the child's head.
And sometimes it occurs due to a hidden cause which is unknown.
But I have never seen this illness except in children; and all those whom I have seen are at the point of death, and thus it is left to me to see a work laid out in them.
And I have seen that one child had a head filled with water, and the top of it was always so magnificent that he could not cease from his own greatness, and more than the humidity made it increased until mortal fire.
And this humidity either accumulates between the bone and the skull, or accumulates below the skull over the brain.
Therefore, the operation in that case if the humidity is between the bone and the skull and the apostema is small, then it is good that you cut in the middle location of the head with a fissure in the latitude, and the length of the fissure should be about two inches until the humidity runs out, and this is the form of the spatula:
And therefore if the humidity is more increased and the apostema is greater, then two fissures are needed according to this manner:
And if the humidity is below the skull, then the sign of it is that you will open the commissures of the head on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your hand into the parted parts and it is not hidden from you. It is good that you cut in the middle location of the head with three fissures according to this manner:
And accordingly, extract all the humidity from the wound; and accordingly, strengthen the fissures with cloths and poultices; and accordingly, bind it over with oil and vinegar for five days, and accordingly, loosen the ligament and cure the wound with gentle and soothing remedies, and strengthen the head with equality; and feed the patient with dry food of little humidity until the member is comforted and healed.
And there is another manner of incision that considers where the magnitude of the apostema and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right side, or on the left side; and therefore attend to the incision where the apostema appears and the filling of water, and do so according to what seems best to you.
And observe that you do not cut the artery, and consider that blood flows out and the patient dies from that flow of blood with evacuation of humidity.
Chapter Two.
When it happens to someone that there are catarrhs or rheums in the eyes or feet, and this is long-standing, and does not conform to the cure of medicines, then the last resort in this case is incision of those two arteries.
And therefore it is good when you want to incise those which the patient's head swells, and accordingly freshen the location with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and accordingly strengthen the neck of the patient with some cloth; and accordingly consider on pulsing the vein; and the places of each one on the places which are near the ears depressed, and as much as they are hidden from some people.
And accordingly signal above the artery with a tentative touch, and accordingly incise each one with the spatula of each side, sharp as the edge of each part, entering into the bone, and so it will be by the latitude of the head.
And if you want, insert the spatula below the artery and cut it at the incisions on the sides above.
And be the length of the incision about two fingers' breadth, for when some vein is incised the blood flows out with pulsatile egression, which jumps forth by frequent jumping.
But if the artery does not appear on the surface, then it is good that you measure from the ear the quantity of space of three fingers' breadth, and accordingly signal with a tentative touch, and then enter into the bone.
And as much blood as is good to take out is about one ounce of vinegar. and not too much or too little, and all the same is according to the quantity which appears of the virtue of the illness and the filling of the artery in him.
And accordingly consider the wound, and therefore if any cause of the skull remains on the bone, then incise it so that no apostema forms.
And accordingly strengthen the wound with poultices and ligatures of cloth of linen, and accordingly cure it with gentle remedies until it is healed.
Chapter III.
On the Extraction of the Arteries which are in the Temples.
When an ancient or recent migration occurs in the temples due to humidities and qualities of the lacertae, or an old and vehement sores similar to those, and it is medicated by the methods of curative medicine, but this does not conform, then we have tried these maladies with the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or cauterization of those just as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of those is that the patient's pulse appears on the temples; and understand that the artery which is apparent in the temple is shown to you by its pulsation, and it is hidden from few people by the violence of fear.
And if it is hidden from you, then strengthen the neck of the patient with some cloth; and accordingly freshen the location with a rough cloth or evaporate the location with hot water until the artery appears to you manifestly. And then take the spatula of which this is the form: And accordingly you scrape the bone with that spatula with ease until you reach the artery; and accordingly take it out and extract it from the upper parts to the sides, until you extract it from the bone and discover those tunics which are below it, of all parts.
But if the artery is thin, then accordingly envelop it with the extremity of the oncus, and cut off one part of it according to the quantity by which its extremities are lengthened and contracted, and do not allow a flux of blood, for if it is not incised, the blood will not rise entirely.
And accordingly evacuate one ounce of blood. within three.
And if the artery is large, then it is good that you tie it in two places with a faithful double knot of cord or with cords to a long length, and do not allow putrefaction to occur before the consolidation of the wound and a flow of blood.
And accordingly incise the superfluity which is between two ligatures; and do this in that hour or about another hour.
And if you want, cauterize that with a cauterizer into the bone with a cutler's cauterizer until the extremities of it are incised and remain in place for that middle work.
And it is better work when the patient has fever or is of scorched complexion; for cauterization is one of those causes that help to dry up humors, and therefore it is better in judgment.
And it is good that you accordingly extract the arteries which fill the old wound, and be paused on the powdery decently made, and accordingly be cured with dry medicines making the flesh and some others to heal until it is healed.
And if while you are working another time, a flux of blood occurs from the artery, then accordingly you must take care to restrain that blood, either with cauterization or by filling the old wound, and strengthen your hand until the blood is restrained. And if any cause of those is not present to you, then accordingly pause your hand over the place until the blood is congealed, and wrap the place with hot water of vehement coldness so that the sharpness may rest, and be strengthened according to what is good.
And this is the easier way in extracting an artery: that you cauterize the vein with this cauterizer having two hilted swords, since you have marked out the two places with a tentative touch, and lay each one, very quietly, until they reach the bone and cut off the vein at two places, so that what is between its extremities may be lengthened, for they are not yet completely consolidated by this cauterization.
And this is the form of the cauterizer:
and be the sharpness of the two swords examples. But if the sharpness is not as great as two swords, it is better, for if they are keen like two swords close to each part, and do not cut into the flesh with velocity.
Therefore, as in those there is some thickness, it is held that the heat of the fire is in them and the flesh is cut off slightly.
And this work is better in all work and easier.
and be the space which is between two swords the quantity of the thickness of the said [cauterizer].
Chapter Four.
On the Cure of Corrosive and Acid Tears from the Eyes.
When there are acidic tears, and the body of those veins which are above the forehead of the head is defore, and does not conform to any cause of the cure of medicine, and the face of the patient becomes reddened and feels a wandering sensation in his own forehead, as if it were a marching of ants, and the eyes of that person are exhausted, moistened by the acidity, so that their eyelids are constricted, and the eyelashes are scarred by the sharpness of the tears, those old agro mixes with the cure of those of this operation, and name that cure "spassa".
And this is that you command the patient to tear off the skin which is on his forehead, and accordingly incise three fissures equally distant from each other according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure is two fingers' breadth: one fissure shall be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle location of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little bit of the movement of the lacertae which are in the lacrimal, and the third on the other side.
And beware of the incision of the arteries which are in two sides, and lengthen your hand with the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is the quantity of three fingers' breadth adjusted.
And if you have a sponge or dry cloths which absorb the blood.
And accordingly insert the spatula of two sharp extremities, from which this is the form of the incision of it: which is from the temple's part to the second incision. Excise with that all the cord which is between two incisions on the skull which is above the bone, and accordingly make this of the incision to migrate into the second incision. And accordingly place in this spatula and insert into the first incision another instrument which is called a cuteller, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And pause the edge of that which is sharp on one side and not sharp on the other, so that it cuts through the flesh annexed to the cord, and the edge of the instrument goes into the bone, and insert that into the fissure, and cut off with that all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let it be continued the incision up to where it appears on the cord, and accordingly make this in the middle fissure into another fissure.
And since there is a quantity of blood equal to the cord, express the places of the cloths of the congealed blood.
And accordingly pause in each fissure a layer of old cloth, and pause over those powders imbued with wine, oil, and vinegar, so that no hidden apostema occurs.
And on the third day loosen the ligature and administer great effusion of hot water or tubbing, and accordingly cure it with gentle remedies made from basilicum, red oil, and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter V.
On the Cure of Lachrymation by Cauterization and to the Eyes descending from the parties behind the head.
When there are some veins that cauterize sharply and continuously, and the patient's eyes are exhausted and small, and their regard is weakened, and the palpebral edges are ulcerated and their skin is worn away, and in the forehead of the head there is sharp pain and subsequent exhaustion, then accordingly you should know by these accidents that the matters and cauterization do not come from many veins of the parties behind proceeding.
And the best cure in those is this: that you command the patient to tear off his forehead, and accordingly incise a fissure at the middle location of the forehead, a little for its length (and it begins with the fissure of the left temple and extends to the right temple; and be the incision into the bone; and lengthen your hand along the lacertae of the temples which are opposite to the mastigation), so that the bone is uncovered.
Dry up all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth, and accordingly fill in between the two lips of the fissure with old cloth or cloths of linen. And accordingly strengthen it with powders imbued with wine and oil, so that no hidden apostema occurs.
And when you have done this and see that the apostema is already diminished, then accordingly it is good to heat the bone so that it begins to be covered with flesh, and accordingly cure it with a regimen of drying, which makes the flesh new, just as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them together, and from them make an emplaster and administer it in these wounds of the native flesh.
Chapter VI.
On the Cure of That Which Cats in the Ears.
All cause that cats in the ears is one of four species, for either it is mineral pyre or a similar cause, like iron and vinegar, or it is from a plant, such as cypress or fava, or it is a fluxible cause, like hot water and wine with its semblances, or some beast.
And therefore, when pyre cats in the ear or another cause similar to those causes that do not adjust nor believe in the ear, and pause the ear at the sun, and if sometimes the pyre appears, then accordingly distill into that some cause of violet oil or samian, and accordingly administer the extraction of it, and make the stornutate in conditions, and fill up the nostrils with the event of stornutation. And accordingly pause in the circuit of the ear some cloths of cloth or wool, and extend the ear to the upper parts, for many times it is forgotten with these causes.
And if it is not gotten, then accordingly administer the extraction of it with the instrument called "gesti epicicarios" subtle, from which this is the form:
And if it is forgotten by gesture, be so; and otherwise, accordingly administer the extraction of it with a subtle onyx of a few duplication.
And therefore, if it is not forgotten by this, accordingly make a needle of iron and insert the tip of the needle into the hole of the ear and close around the needle with wax and softened oil, so that only the needle remains. And accordingly extract from the same vein with strong attraction, for many times as we have recounted.
But if it is not forgotten in this manner, then accordingly take from the candlelight or the veiled cloth with which are caught the birds a small quantity, and pause that in the tip of the ray, and accordingly wrap around it decently paused. And accordingly insert that into the hole of the ear with ease, and accordingly dry up the ear from its humidity.
And therefore, if it is not forgotten by all the causes which we have recounted, then accordingly you take care to cut off that before it becomes hidden apostema or spasms.
And the manner of cutting off that is: you first lance the patient's saphena vein and extract the blood according to the method of the virtue of it, and accordingly make that cease between your hands and convert the ear to the upper parts, and end with a small fissure in the root of the ear opposite to the grey of it in the place previously marked. And let the fissure be in the shape of a lunar figure until it reaches the pyre, and when the pyre is blackened, stop that if you can with appropriate instruments; and accordingly close the fissure at that hour with velocity, and cure it so that it may be healed.
And if the cause is in the ear is one of the fat that creases and swells, then accordingly administer the cure and extraction of it; but if it does not obey your command to yield, then you take a spatula of subtle tin according to this form: and accordingly administer to that the excision of that fat which is fallen into the ear.
And do not make this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and pause in many cloths, and accordingly extract from those with onyxes or subtle gestures, or by incision as we have said, for it is eased the extraction of it.
But in the water which is entered into the ear, it is good for the patient to use stornutation with conditions at first, and fill his own ear with a little old cloth, and then pour over that ear in which the water is, and if it is forgotten, be so; and otherwise, accordingly take many tin pyres and lemons according to the length of the finger, and heat those in the fire for a short time, and let the patient insert one of those into the hole of his own ear and strike on that one side of that part and percuss it with another pyre over the pyre which is next to the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with a pyre until all the water is forgotten.
Therefore, do not cease this with a pyre until all the water is forgotten. And already the water will be forgotten in such a way that you take from paper or bone and so on. and place one end of it in the ear and extend the other end into the fire until the top of it is burned.
And accordingly place another bone and make it so many times until all the water is forgotten, and extract that with a cannula as said above of the pyre extractor.
But in the extraction of beast that enters into that ear, if it is small and similar to this, cure it as we have said in the division; but if it is a large body which appears to the sense of the vessel, then accordingly administer the extraction with gestures and onyxes, and the cause of it is more lighter than all other causes that cat in the ear.
But in the extraction of worm generated in the ear, when you cure that with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and do not confirm your cure, then accordingly it is good to look at the ear to the sun.
And therefore, if any cause of the worms appears here, then accordingly extract that with gestures or subtle onyxes; but if no cause appears, then you take a cannula made of dried and widened material, and this is its form: And insert the subtle extremity into the ear according to the quantity which can be tolerated by the patient; and accordingly suck it with a strong suction, and do this many times, until all the worms are forgotten.
But if it does not obey your command, then accordingly you stop and close in the circuit of the cannula with wax as we have said; then accordingly administer distillations which have already been tried by the ancients in the cure of worms, and find this in the treatise on distillations.
And accordingly your effusion with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear with this instrument, and this is its form: And make that of silver or iron, dried, in which there is a small hole, and on the top.
And accordingly it will be like when you are prompted to do what is in the conquest of the cannula of continuity here, which will be necessary. And if you wish, take the rod and wrap it around the tip of it decently, and accordingly pour oil into the concavity of the augment, or juice from some herb, or whatever you want from these medicines in the cannula — and that is in the ear —, and accordingly insert the rod with a gentle touch above and press gently with your hand that compression in moderation, until the oil is expelled into the concavity of the augment and the patient feels the oil behind.
And what is inserted into the ear is already burned with fire for a little bit. And take care that the cause which you are going to distill in the ear is not too hot, because the medicines of the ear cannot tolerate this.
Chapter VII.
On the Cure of Earstoppering.
Some times some children are born with the vents of their mothers not perforated, and this already happens in some men, earstoppering in the meat of the ear by wound or flesh not yet formed in that; and this earstoppering sometimes is made in the forehead of the track of the ear which does not consent to the vessel, and sometimes it is outside.
And that which occurs in the forehead of it, which does not comprehend the vessel, is in the greater difficulties of difficult healing.
And in that which succeeds the vessel, it is good for you to pause the ear of the patient at the sun and regard in that. And therefore, if there appears an obstruction, open it with a subtle spatula of which this is the form:
If the extremity of it in which there is a small latitude, one part being acute and the other not; and the spatula be two-leoned for so that it does not cause trouble to the ear.
And therefore, if the earstoppering is due to flesh born in the ear or in the meat of it, then accordingly extract that with subtle onyxes and cut it with fervent facility until all the flesh is removed.
And if the earstoppering is in the forehead of the ear, then accordingly take a subtle rod of iron and heat that slightly with fire, and accordingly insert it into the meat of the ear.
And therefore, if you have sensed an obstruction with what the patient has found by ease, due to gravity of hearing, then accordingly strive against the oppression of it by ease; and take care that you do not plague the nerves of the ear.
And accordingly pause in the ear with cloth of linen according to the quantity of the width of the track which you have wrapped in Egyptian bandage; and do this for some days until you are sure of the consolidation of the wound; or take water and pour it into vessels and powder over it as sifted, and use it; and if the ear is already apostemated, then accordingly it is good to extract the poultice and replace it with another poultice which you wrap in cerote made with rose oil, until the apostema becomes quiet; and accordingly cure that until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then accordingly submerge a sponge or cloth in hot water and pause over the ear, and use another cure which restrains the flow of blood, which is said in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter VIII.
On the Cure of Athazil Which Causes the Eyelids to Swell.
Athazils which cause swelling in the eyelids of some people sometimes humid, and sometimes dry.
Therefore, it is good for you to take those with tenhandles or onyxes, and cut them with the spatula of their roots, and accordingly pause over the places sifted.
But if pain with blood flow comes, then accordingly you should cauterize those with a subtle lancet-like cauterizer.
And the best cauterization is accordingly at the incisions and many times return when there remains some cause of their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter IX.
On the Cure of Grandeyss Which Comes to the Eyelids of Men.
Many times it grows in the eyelids of men some cause which is similar to grandeyss in its strength and hardness, and therefore grandeyss is called.
And it is an aggregation of great moisture on the eyelid above and below.
Therefore, the operation in them is that you should consider whether the grandeyss proceeds from it in what appears of the eyelid and is spread to all parts; and the cause of it is light.
Therefore, make an incision over it with a fissure by latitude, and accordingly extract that from all parts with ease, and accordingly suspend it with an onyx and cut it off.
And if the figure is great, then accordingly you should adjust it with a suture; and cure that until it is healed.
And if it is little, then accordingly you will not suffer harm from it because the substance of it restores that and incorporates.
And if the grandeyss is declining to the outer parts of the eyelid, then accordingly you should remove the surface outward, and then ease the eyelid and suspend the grandeyss with an onyx, unless you are needed for incision, and press that from all parts, and if the eyelid by incision is elongated, this will not be noticed in any cause.
And accordingly the incision, wash the eye with salty water; and cure the place with that which incorporates until it is healed.
Chapter X.
On the Cure of Axirnah in the Eyelid Above the Eye.
Axcirnah is a greyish thing which is generated in the tunic of the eyelid above, and most commonly grows on children, aggravates their eyes and causes them to become blind; and they cannot look at the clarity of the sun because tears are shed for them.
And therefore you should often rub their faces with your hands, and on their faces they sleep; and so the eyelids of theirs above are covered with humid overlays, which already have swelling, and there is apparent inflammation in the eye; and when you press the place with those words I mentioned, you will cause inflammation within them.
And some manner of operation is in that which the patient places their own head on the other side, and accordingly pauses a cloth with linen and wool, and makes a circle according to the quantity which contains arthernach from all parts, and accordingly places that over that and presses with the words I mentioned, so that inflammation may be added in the middle of the circle, and accordingly ends in the middle of that humidity with a spatula inserted into a fissure by latitude, and the fissure is not greater than the one made in flaubotomia.
But in the forehead it is good for you to split the cord throughout until you reach arthernach, because in the greatest difficulties arthernach processes by fissure according to the form of white greyce.
Therefore, extract that with cloths which you have wrapped between the said words and the outer parts, and roll it between your right and left hand until it is dispersed.
And take care that you do not insert into the fissure, lest with the spatula you come too close to the eye and damage it.
But if you do not see arthernach at the beginning of the fissure, but rather insert into the fissure a little with ease until arthernach processes; and accordingly extract that as we have said; and accordingly submerge cloths in water, vinegar and powder, and pause them over the place and strengthen those with powders.
And thus some of which are salty pause that in the concavity of the fissure, so that this remaining humidity is drained.
And accordingly cure that until it is healed.
But if there is an apostema cautious in the place, then accordingly cure that with sedative plasters until it is healed.
Chapter XI.
On Methods of Examining the Eye.
When in the eyelids of men there are noted by adjustment the natural hairs and so antiquated, then accordingly those do not belong to the eye and cause endogenous methods of illness such as constant tears and softening of eyelids and skin, which is the cause of destruction of the eye that is called tactionary of the eye; and it is cured in four ways: or by cauterization with fire; or by acute medicine according to what is said beforehand in the chapter on cauterization; or made into a tactionary through incision and suturing; or by canals, as you will say.
And therefore it is good for you to pause the patient's head on the other side; accordingly turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is turned, well it is; and otherwise, insert a needle into that in which is faithful to the outermost part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate through the faithful part above, and so - exactly at the edge of the eyelid where there are no hairs - exactly on the hairs, and pull the thread up to the outer parts above the eyelid, and turn that with a rod.
And accordingly end in the outer part of the eyelid behind the hairs with a spatula inserted into the lacrimal major and entering into the lacrimal minor; and accordingly extract the thread and pause below the eyelid with small powders of cotton or cloth, and accordingly seal over the eyelid with a tent, and be thus like the figure of mirt leaf.
But it is also good that the figure be according to the quantity of heaviness of the eyelid, for this already varies among men, since some of them require that a great quantity be incised from the eyelid, according to the quantity by which the eyelid is softened.
And accordingly end with the spatula on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the lacrimal major to the lacrimal minor. And if your fissure is right next to the natural hairs like it is the greatest thickness of a king.
And accordingly place the onyx in one of the two angles of the cord, and accordingly excise that entire, and accordingly adjust with the incision the two lips with a subtle wool or thread, and abstain from blood, and cause to adhere what is superfluous from the threads on two overlids with some causes visible, if you wish to do so, and otherwise, do not cure.
And accordingly loosen the suture of the threads within three or four days, and accordingly care for that.
And if you wish, leave the wound open without suture, and care for that with what dries up and constricts, since the eyelid is raised by the sealing of the wound and the incorporation of it; but suture is better. Therefore, thus I say to the ancients of tactionary.
But it is also necessary in that there be solicitude over the patient, and it is of good operation, and not in that there is fear.
And there is another manner in tactionary, and it is that you mark on the eyelid a figure like a leaf of myrtle, and accordingly lift the eyelid with three separated and gathered threads according to this form:
But if it is not possible to do so, take the threads, and this is not equivalent, then take one needle with a thread and put that in the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread next to the lacrimal major, and the third thread next to the lacrimal minor, and adjust between the said words the threads with equality, and accordingly with those lift your hand with an equal elevation, lift the entire cord above which is marked as we have recounted.
And accordingly adjust the two lips of the wound with suture, and care for that until it is healed.
But if an apostema occurs because of your incision or your fissure, calm that apostema with cerote and like manner, and with gentle herbs.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its own hairs are converted, then it is good for you to use in that what we have said about incision; but suture in each case is more artificial.
Atactionary by canals is according to this form: and it is that you convert the eyelid and divide the figure which is behind according to what I have recounted; and accordingly, by art, make two canals or two subtle tubes of which the length is according to the length of the eyelid and the latitude of them is less than the latitude of the spatula. And you have already incised in the extremities of each partition, where you have the threads.
And accordingly add each one to subtlety on top of what is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and constrict the canals of each partition with a very strict constriction, and leave that for some days, because the cord through the constriction will die and become denegated and will sink into place until it naturally falls.
But if it is delayed, then accordingly cut the cord with the tortoises, and accordingly care for the wound until it is healed.
Therefore, when it is solidified, the eyelid is lifted and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two canals which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of length and latitude neither more nor less.
Chapter XII.
On Lifting of Prickly Hairs on the Eye with a Needle when the Hair is Hard.
When the hairs are unnatural, hard and rough and prickly on the eyes, then accordingly the operation in that is that you take a subtle needle and insert it into that thread of fine wool or linen, and accordingly adjust the extremities of it so that each one is done in a manner very subtly. And let the length of the threads be of the quantity of one palm.
And accordingly you compose another subtle thread below it in brief, and knot the extremities of that if you wish.
And accordingly place the patient's head on the other side, and be right next to the sun so that your work may be declared, for it is a subtle and minute operation.
And accordingly insert the needle into the root of the adjusted hair which has required gentle handling, and cause that to penetrate into the eyelid rapidly until you extract it above the natural hair.
And accordingly pull out the hair to the top and insert that into the fold, and be the hairs one, two, or three, but not more.
And accordingly pull out your hand with that until the hair is pulled out from the fold and inserted into the eyelid along with the natural hair.
But if it is pulled out of the fold and not pulled out the hair, pull out the fold to the parts below with the thread which you have composed there, until it is pulled out from the superincumbent part.
And behold that with the vision of the eye, for accordingly you will pull out the fold and the thread, and grind each one and clean the eye, and leave the closure for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and grows well on top of it.
And if the hair is shorter, accordingly you adjust a longer hair from the natural hairs, and elevate it with that, or leave it until it grows long enough to fill in the space, and then you elevate it.
Chapter XIII.
On the Cure of Echacration which appears in the eyelid above.
When echacration appears on the eye, and it is contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted in its own direction, or to the right or left side, due to bad consolidation of wound or cutting or cauterization, and it is called leporina, and this echacration either occurs naturally or accidentally, and is caused by consolidation of wound or cutting or cauterization, or through resemblance to their maladies.
And the manner of the operation in that is that you split open that consolidation and separate the lips of it, and insert into it a piece of cloth or linen, and bind those together until they are healed.
And it is not good for you to use a cure on it from the causes which dry up and constrict; for if you do that, the echacration will return worse than before, with no time at all having passed.
Use on it causes that soften, such as fenugreek, and anoint with the water in which are soaked the leaves of the plant or with dyaquilon, which is liquefied with some of the oils, and submerge into that piece of cloth, and care for it.
And the treasure of your cure is that you perform with all gentle handling, not allowing anything to be consolidated according to the form that it had at the beginning.
And this operation which we have described is nothing but some correction of echacration that does not return to its original form as it was before.
Chapter XIV.
On the Cure of Echacration which is made in the eyelid below.
This echacration which is made in the eyelid below, which is truly called vertical echacration; and it is of two kinds, one natural, the other accidental.
But accidental is caused by wound or cutting or cauterization or by other similar things.
And the way of the operation is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it pass from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread reaches both extremities of the flesh.
And accordingly extend the flesh to the upper parts with the needle and cut it with the needle, and incise with a spatula wide. And therefore if the figure of the eyelid returns as it should be, well it is; and otherwise, take a thread and pause it in the cut figure, and with that convert the eyelid, and close the two incisions on the underside of the eyelid below.
And be the extremities of the two incisions at two angles of the cut which you have made, where they meet, and be a figure formed by their intersection.
And this figure is the Greek letter lambda (λ).
And accordingly stop the flesh at that quantity which is the width of the lacrimal below it, so as to secure the eyelid.
And accordingly adjust the separated parts and sew them together with wool thread; and accordingly care for those with what we have said about softening medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if echacration occurs through a fissure or suture or cauterization, accordingly it is necessary to cut with a flat incision on the hairs of the eyelid as has been described beforehand. And accordingly separate with a poultice between two lips, according to what we have said.
In the summary of the sermon on the cure of echacration when it is above or below, that operation runs in this way: according to the preparation of the form of echacration, and it is in the form of various motes.
And the skilled craftsmen always prepare with great care in each manner possible to bring back the figure to its natural form or near it, and that malady according to what is convenient for the operation and instruments in the greatest dispositions.
Chapter XV.
On the Adhesion of the Eyelid to the Conjunctiva or Cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many men, it is necessary to solidify the eyelid above the white of the eye, and be prohibited from the facility of movement and its natural works, therefore it is good that you enter into the extremity of the thread below the eyelid, and lift it up, or extend it with a thread.
And accordingly you incise the adhesion with a subtle spatula, which is not sharp as the incisions, having obtuse a little bit so that the malady will not be disturbed during the operation, and remove the spatula so that it does not touch the eye with its sharpness.
And be your incision what excises that adhesion with facility, until the eyelid is returned to its natural form and the entire adhesion is healed.
And accordingly you put into the eye salted water with which you wash, or distill in it of zunia dissolved in water.
And accordingly separate between the eyelid and the eye with a poultice of linen, and pause over the eye wool infused in album of egg, and accordingly use on the third day causes that consolidate until it is healed.
Chapter XVI.
On the Incision of the Nail and Eminence of Flesh of the Lacrimals.
Know that the nail is in two manners, because either it is nervous, and is similar to hard and subtle cipha; or it is non-nervous, resembling white congealed humidity, which when iron touches it, or it becomes brittle and the onci is severed from it, and the onci does not stick to it.
And both species do not begin until from the lacrimal major, gradually decreasing as it covers the eye and prohibits light and movement of the eye.
But the manner of working in this incision is that the malady puts its head in its own place, and accordingly opens the eyes of it, and lifts up the eyelid with your hand, and accordingly collects the nail with onci of little duplication and extends it to the upper parts. And accordingly take a needle and enter into it a piece of horse or ox or cow hair, or something similar, or a strong thread, or duplicate the extremity of the needle little by little and place it in the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail to the thread; and extend it to the upper parts, and excise at the edge of the nail what is blocking the pupil. And thus you follow that with hair until the end of it.
And accordingly you incise the remainder in the root of the lacrimal with a subtle spatula or with little forceps, and free the natural flesh of the lacrimal so that through the incision of it there will not be continuous flowing of tears.
And at some times the nail with only one thread extended or with thread, as we have said, and accordingly it is excised with a lion's spatula of which this is its form:
And beware that with the spatula you do not touch the corneal tunic and cause a rupture in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
And accordingly the incision will be in the eye a little salt crushed or made from fine sand, and let it rest until the next day; and accordingly care for that with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nervous and you cannot put the needle in it, nor is the thread fixed in that, accordingly many times this species of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed thus as I have said and recounted in the division.
And if you want to incise it, accordingly you work on the eye of the malady and take a subtle spatula lion of fine sharpness according to this form: with subtlety. And if at times it is rarified and confused and takes root in that reason, accordingly distill from your eye into the eye made of fine sand or with rough sand or crushed salt, and anoint the eye until the next day.
And accordingly repeat on that the operation until everything that is of it is removed, except for the contrary aposteme which is in the eye, because accordingly you will leave it and cure at the beginning the aposteme until it is healed.
And accordingly repeat your operation on that with reason until it is healed.
The eminence of the lacrimal flesh, if noticed in the eye with great harm, be suspended by thread; and incise it on that side, and do not complete the incision so that you do not excise flowing tears.
And accordingly distill in the lacrimal rough sand and fine sand until it is healed.
Chapter XVII.
On the Incision of Algae and of that which is born from adjusted flesh in the eye.
Some times in the eyes of certain people is born red flesh, and it is superimposed so that it covers the pupil, or approaches or strengthens over the eyelids and firmly compresses the eyelids at the upper parts and is assembled like a rose trellis.
But the operation in this case is that the malady puts its head in its own place; and accordingly opens the eyes of it and collects all that red flesh with onci suitable for that purpose, and takes that with a forceps or with tweezers; and accordingly incises the flesh at the beginning until everything is finished with the scissors, and beware of the eye so that you do not touch it during your operation.
And accordingly your incision will be with the one with which you incise those or with spatula which we have recounted in the incision of the nail, or with little forceps with which it is collected according to what comes next in this form, approaching to this chapter.
Therefore, when your incision is complete and all that red flesh is removed, accordingly fill the eye with crushed salt, or distill into it a red powder resembling the medicines corrosive, and anoint the eye outside with album of egg until you are assured of the contrary aposteme.
And if there remains any cause of alguardenici and it is cautious of the contrary aposteme, and you fear the contrary aposteme, accordingly leave the eye alone and cure that aposteme with what will calm down that aposteme, and accordingly repeat on that with operation until it is healed, and similarly do in the adjusted flesh which occurs in the eye of this kind.
But however you must ensure that all cure of the eye is done through natural or accidental means, not with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that that member is sufficient for that operation.
Chapter XVIII.
On the Collection of Scales in the Eye.
Scales which come red and are tough on the eye, prohibiting it from performing its operation, and uncovering the eye with a length of days.
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning that you consider whether the eye in which there are scales is strong and in it there is no other disease except for scales, accordingly you will collect those scales.
And it is that you command the malady to put its head in its own place, and accordingly suspend those veins with one thread or two according to your prudence; and let that thread be of subtle duplication according to this form:
or two threads gradually in one body according to this form:
And accordingly they will be collected with subtle forces, with subtlety, and washed away hour by hour, until you see those veins being removed from the eye and being turned back.
And beware that you do not touch the eye with the extremities of the spatula; and if your operation is in the middle of the day before the sun, and be very firm in your operation so that you only incise those veins.
And when you have completed, accordingly you will distill into the eye green or red powder so that with its sharpness it can corrode the water that is removed from the scales.
But if it is not possible for you to collect all at that hour, accordingly you will plaster the whole with what relieves the pain of it, and leave it for some days until the pain is calmed down and assured against the contrary aposteme.
And accordingly repeat on it in the same manner until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter XIX.
On the Reduction of Rhinitis to the Nose.
When you cure arisati with cauterization or acute medicine, which are contrary to the preceding narrative of it and do not heal, accordingly you will not intervene in it, but rather make a wound over the aposteme of the nose, so that its maturity is revealed, and extract all the moisture that is in it and pour it into an ossuary until the bone is uncovered.
And therefore when the bone is uncovered and there is corruption or blackness in it, accordingly you will scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is called the "aspre cap", and it is made of iron, and it has a redon head like that which is made pointed by the point of a file or caulked by a subtle puncture (such as is in the following form).
And place that on the local corruption of the bone, and accordingly move it back and forth between those two said points, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and accordingly restore the local area with drying and purging causes.
Therefore, if the local area is consolidated and good flesh has grown in it, and the wound of the pus has been closed for 40 days, and it is not renewed and not apostematized and does not occur an accident in it, accordingly you will know that it is healed.
And otherwise, accordingly you will not intervene in it, but rather reduce the fissure to the form of the nose, and according to this manner: and it is that you uncover the second bone with iron or acute medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, accordingly you take a tribe according to this form:
Be the extremity of the iron triangular, and the handle of it be first thinned down to the extremity, just so that it is sometimes thus.
And accordingly place that on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal; and stretch your hand a little bit away from the eye, and accordingly revolve your hand with the tribe until it penetrates all the bone, and that feels the malady by as much as it is found to issue forth when you withdraw your hand.
Therefore, accordingly restore the local area with purging and drying medicines, just as if it were being treated.
Therefore, when the flesh and local area are restored, accordingly the matter which was flowing into the partitions outside returns to the nose, therefore this is more pleasant over the malady.
Chapter XX.
On the Reduction of the Eminence of the Eye.
When the eye eminence is total and does not occur in it any slight or diminution, accordingly you must loosen the malady, and accordingly follow, and accordingly pause at every breath in the cervix without scarification and sucking for good suction; and accordingly place a poultice on the eye which is made of aloe and enses and sarcocolla, and accordingly strengthen the plaster on the eye with many powders.
And the manner of the powders is that you take cloths of lion's wool many, and each cloth be doubled in four folds; and make from those many.
And accordingly place those one upon another according to the quantity which the eye needs. And accordingly strengthen over those with a cloth of hard and strong structure; and iterate the ventouses with suction without scarification; and accordingly stop the ventouses and leave the eye stretched tight for day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament is relaxed, accordingly it must be made very tight.
And accordingly stop the ligament for day and night just as we have said.
And if the eye has already been reduced, well it is, and otherwise, accordingly iterate the plaster with powders, tightness, and ventouses until it is healed.
Chapter XXI.
On the Incision of the Eminence of the Tunica Uvea.
When an endeavor of disruption occurs in the tunica uvea, and accordingly it is elevated and proceeds out of the eyelids just like a grain of raisin, and its form is that of a man through this, and you wish to incise it, accordingly the operation on it is as we have recounted, that you insert the needle into the root of the uvea from the left side and above, and then place another needle in which there is double thread from the part of the lacrimal, and make that penetrate and leave the first needle according to its disposition; and accordingly incise the spot where the double thread is, and lift with it the part of the uvea in the circuit of the needle, and strengthen that very much.
And accordingly extract the needle and place on the eye wool infused in egg white, and leave it until the thread falls off onto the uvea.
And accordingly cure the eye with that which comforts it until the wound is healed.
And some times gather from all parts with a circle of cloth into the eye adjusted eminence great, and accordingly it is perforated with a subtle spatula that comes to the front of the eye, and flows the albuginean humidity, and descends the eye and enters soon.
And accordingly strengthen until it is healed.
Chapter XXII.
On the Cure of Alconatis.
This disease which is called alconatis is nothing but pus which is adjusted in the eye resembling flowing water and not that.
But the manner of working on it is that you make the malady settle on the prepared and right seat, and accordingly take your own head in both hands and press it into the area where you see the pus flowing into the left side, and accordingly let it be dried up and not descend, and block out the light, and let the malady see the causes just as if it were seeing.
And if it does not descend below, you will know that it is water.
But if it is not prepared for the descent of the pus with what we have said, accordingly make the malady settle between your hands and take a subtle spatula and find it above the panniculus cerning a small piece from the continuation of the conjunctiva on the tunic cornea in the crown (in the location that is seen), until the pus is forgotten.
Therefore, when it is forgotten, accordingly you will distill into the eye cold water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And accordingly it is cured by other causes until it is healed.
Chapter XXIII.
On the Cure of Water Descending from the Eye.
We have already said the species of water in the division and which is suitable to pierce with a sharp instrument declaring, accordingly that one according to health.
Accordingly it is necessary that you make the malady settle between your hands on a cayrat and bind your own eye tightly.
And accordingly place your left hand near the eyelid of your own eye, if the eye in which the water is flowing is your left eye; or with your right hand, if it is your right eye.
And accordingly with your right hand take alumina, if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if it is right.
And accordingly place the extremity of alumina near the crown by the thickness of the ray in the album of the eye from the smaller lacrimal part; and accordingly press alumina with virtue and revolve your hand with that.
And accordingly penetrate into the album of the eye and feel that alumina has already reached the visible cause.
And it is necessary that the measure of the path of alumina to the front be the same as the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, and it is the crown of the eye; for you will see with that pupil through the vision of the eye by the clarity of the tunic cornea.
And accordingly place alumina into the location where the water is, and accordingly pull it down slowly once or twice, and therefore if the water descends soon, accordingly see the malady that same day above which your vision dwells, and alumina in its own eye.
And accordingly rest for a little while; therefore if the water has descended, accordingly you will put aside that other time before alumina is gotten.
And therefore when it is dried and no longer descends, accordingly you will extract alumina with ease, and revolve your hand with that little by little, and accordingly dissolve a small amount of clear salt from gemstone in the water and wash the eye outward; and accordingly pause outside the eye coto or stopper or wool infused in rose oil and egg white and bind with water the eye tightly.
But we have those who are of our time that pause upon that which is already mixed with egg white.
And if it does not obey your alumina at the entrance of the eye because of its hardness - for it is one of those men whose eye is very hard -, accordingly you will take the spatula which is called alberid, and this is its form:
And therefore pierce with that the conjuncture, and do not leave your hand in the wound, and do not be if it is not that you make a way to alumina's subtle location.
And accordingly insert alumina according to what we have said.
And you must complete the complement of your work, be prepared for the malady's sleep descent made in which it sleeps on its own back in a dark house, and be forbidden from all movements.
And pause in the nature of that water for which its nature is to be lined up, and do not move your head to either right or left at all.
And let the ligament be according to its disposition within three days.
And accordingly loosen that in the most dark and obscure place, and make the most foul sight, and let it see some causes, and accordingly return the ligament within seven days.
And do not need to make this in the hour of cures or soon after the infusion. They had need that you would alienate this because the water flows more lightly through great and vehement regardment.
But if an apostema occurs, accordingly it is necessary to loosen the eye before seven days, and correct that with water which causes apostema.
Accordingly you will absolve the sight of that and pause on the face of that mouth by which it is regulated the downward flow of that for several days, existing in the most dark.
And accordingly it will be got from that in a gradual manner and converse with its own causes.
And know that in all cases there is no excuse for the student to see some things, and accordingly you will be bold on the operation.
And it has been reached to us from some of those who are in the Artach, and some have said that they make fire in the Ayrac magnificently perforated by which the water is sucked.
But nevertheless you have not seen this done in our land which has perfected this, nor have you read this in some of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the species of magnificence by which it will be upon those things which are unknown to him:
And they are made of iron or steel properly, and they are the extremities of their own shape with this subtlety triangular, the pointed tip just like that is the form.
Chapter XXIV.
On the Cure of Nothingness in the Nose.
When in the nose are born various skins adjusted of which some cause is assembled to that of scorpion's weight or to polygamous flesh; and this disease is called polypus because it resembles that represented by those flesh. And from it comes a cancerous skin, pale and of dark color; and from it comes the lion's flesh, not of dark color.
Therefore, in that which is in those lion's flesh not fraudulent nor cancerous, it is necessary to make the malady settle between your hands and place it under the sun, and warm the nose of that, and cut it once in those flesh. And accordingly extract that from the outside parts and accordingly incise it with a sharp spatula of subtle one-sidedness into that which you have understood, so that you know that all the flesh is already removed; for if there remains some cause from which abscission is possible, accordingly you will ratify this with one of the subtle instruments with ease, so that no cause remains. But if it bleeds or an apostema occurs, accordingly you will pause on that which is needed; or it is one of the malignant apostemas, accordingly you will compress and cauterize that until the blood is absorbed and all the cavities are removed.
And accordingly it should be gotten in the nose, according to the incision made with water or wine. But if the nose is open and from it proceeds humidity into the palate, accordingly you will know that it is already healed.
But if the humidity does not penetrate according to what is needed, accordingly you will know that behind it is nothingness in the pustules on the superfluous bones of the nose which has not been subjected to abscission.
Therefore, accordingly it is necessary to insert faithfully into the one who has some coarseness, and noise in the mouth noises, and pause between each noise the quantity of that or less, and generate the malady and enter one extremity of the thread into the nose with the ray or with another cause which is possible there.
And since this will have been done, accordingly take your odorant and enter it into the nostrils so that it reaches the channels of the nose, and be placed above your palate, for many times the appearance of this action makes children laugh at school, and is a light cause for one who wants to do it.
And accordingly pause the two extremities of the thread, one extremity that goes out over the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and accordingly administer a seal of flesh to the noises that are in the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is already tied to the noises of the thread.
And accordingly extract the thread, and pause in the nose approximately the abstraction of blood a quarter, and do this for three days or more until the scabbed wound is completely dry from the flesh.
And accordingly in the end of the cause, pause in the nose a leaden cannula for several days until it is healed.
But if you run out of cure that exists, use this one.
And this is the form of the instrument maker of cappurge which makes oils and medicines in the nose:
And make this of silver or iron, which is similar to a small open lantern, just like a small shell, and the metal similarly.
And if you want, make a closed cannula like a reed, and the cannula of the instrument maker of cappurge is flat, uncovered; to which there is a handle at the end of it, with which you will hold that when you draw out in oil or water that you want from the juices and causes suitable.
Chapter XXV.
On the Hidden Natures in the Extremities of the Nose.
Many times there is a hidden nature in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and emphasized in certain days until it is seen to be the regardment of it.
And accordingly you should incise that in the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all that. And accordingly pause over the place or cauterize or apply medicine which is already there in that location.
But if the incision is delayed until it is magnified, accordingly consider whether it is calcified, hard, dark in color and with little sensation, accordingly do not touch that with iron, for it is cancerous apostema; for many times, to those who make this incision, a great malice is kindled against him who had made it.
And if the apostema is of lion's touch and not of dark color, and many times incision is possible in all that, accordingly evacuate the malady and make the incision without fear, and cure the place with what exists and constrain it until it is healed.
Chapter XXVI.
On the Suture of the Nose and Lips and Ear when Continuity is Dissolved by Wound or Similarity.
Know that when dissolution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, few confer in that operation except in some men.
Therefore, when it is necessary to consider some cause of those, know that if the wound is fresh with its own blood, accordingly you will adjust the two lips of the wound with suture, and accordingly cure that until it is healed.
And if the lips of dissolution of continuity are already separated, and each is made whole, accordingly it is necessary that you excise each part of its own apparent code until there is no more blood. And accordingly adjust the two lips with suture and strengthen those, and on top of those sprinkle dragon's blood powder and mixed with three parts, and pause over the powder one plaster made from definiçon, or some other consolidating plaster, and leave that tied for two days or three, and accordingly loosen that and replace it with another plaster and leave that until the flesh is absorbed, and accordingly cure with scabbing until it is healed.
But the manner of suture is that you add the solution of continuity or with needles as we have recounted in the suturing of the belly, or add the solution of continuity with thread as you do and make it known.
Chapter XXVII.
On the Extraction of those causes that come in the two lips in the parts behind.
Many times it is necessary for certain men in the parts behind their lips to remove some hard and similar-looking lumps which are like errors, and some of theirs are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore, accordingly you should convert the lips and openings each of those hardenings in all parts, and accordingly fill the wound with sagacious powder mixed with three parts until the blood is restrained, and accordingly wash it with warm water and cure the place with what exists, until it is healed.
Chapter XXVIII.
On the Incision of the Flesh Adjusted in the Gums.
Great many times there is need to cut into the adjusted flesh in the gum which the ancients called albulus, accordingly it is necessary that you suspend that with a hook or that you hold that with the forceps and incise that as it should be done, and let the pus run or let the blood.
And accordingly pause over the place with sagacious powder or other stinging or exciting powders.
And if that flesh returns, accordingly incise it secondarily and cauterize it, for accordingly the cautery will not return.
Chapter XXIX.
On the Reason of Teeth with Iron.
When on the surface of the teeth in the parts behind and in front, and between the gums are adjusted rough, ashy, blackened, and some times are darkened and turned yellow or green, so that they appear to the gum by this corruption and the teeth become loose.
And therefore it is necessary that you make the malady settle between your hands and pause the head of it in your own seat, and extract the teeth in which those roughnesses and causes similar to sand appear, until there remains no cause in them, and this will be done with the blackness and yellowness and other things until they are purified.
Therefore, if this is the case that begins with the reason, good; and if not, accordingly you should iterate the reason on those for another day and secondly and thirdly until it comes to the final statement in what you want.
And know that teeth have need of many resorbs of diverse forms and figures according to how it is prepared for your operation. And therefore, since the resorbs with which the tooth is worn down from the back are another type of resorbs than those with which it is rasped between teeth according to other forms, and these forms of resorbs should be prepared by you as you will soon see:
Chapter XXX.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
It is necessary that you cure the tooth of its pain with all care and vigilance in every stage of its eradication, for there is no cause that can withstand the force of it when it is eradicated, for it is a subtle substance into which it is excused in its eradication.
But it is necessary when the malady is forced to eradicate that tooth, that firmly you must be certain which is the aching tooth, for many times the pain deceives the malady and makes it seem to be in a healthy tooth, and you eradicate that one and accordingly the pain does not cease until the sick and aching tooth is eradicated, for we have already seen this through the operation of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which is the aching tooth, and you know well, accordingly it is necessary that you scarify in the circuit of the tooth with a spatula in the part where there is some virtue, until it is dissolved from the tooth of the gum of all parts, and accordingly make a small incision with those said instruments or with subtle forceps little by little until it comes to be extracted.
And accordingly take hold of it with great force for good speech or strong extraction, and pause the head of the malady between those said instruments that you hold so well that they do not hurt, and accordingly pull out the tooth in a straight manner as to not break it, nor give the major pain.
And therefore, if not forgotten, accordingly take one of those instruments and put it behind the tooth on all sides with ease and effort, so that the extraction is done as it was at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or corroded, accordingly it is necessary that you wrap with cloth that crack and strengthen it with a subtle thread at its extremity, in order that it may not be broken during the time of your constriction on it as you hold it.
And accordingly you should work with exquisite care by scarification in the circuit of all parts of the gum and preserve your strength so that you do not break it and leave a part of it, and return to the malady through the malice which is greater than the first pain of it.
And be careful not to do what certain ignorant barbers do in their clumsiness and audacity with the extraction of theirs, without administering that which we have recounted; for many times they bring upon men great illnesses which are more difficult to break than they are to be extracted, and the roots of their gums become all inflamed, or some of those, or that you extract it with certain bones of the jawbone just as many times we have testified.
And accordingly the extraction of it is washed away with warm water or hot water and salt.
And if it is necessary to make flows of blood appear in this way, just as many times it is necessary, accordingly take some quantity of vinegar and sprinkle it over the wound, and if that vinegar does not suffice, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and subtle instruments with which the tooth is extracted at the beginning should be of long extremity, short handle and thick, so that they are not bent when you must operate with them.
And should be like times of thick handle so that when you strain with those instruments they are not bent, and short extremities.
And should be made of Indian iron, descending shapes with straight extremities, and in the extremities of those, teeth that fit into each other and strain by strong constriction, and sometimes the extremities of those are shaped like the beak of a stork which is called ciconia, so it is strong, and son of fort constriccio.
Chapter XXXI.
On the Extraction of Teeth and Removal of Bones from Mandibles Broken.
When you must extract the tooth which is broken and there is some cause, accordingly it is necessary that you pause over the place with a border for one day or two until the place is softened; and accordingly introduce algesic or instruments with the extremities of which are assembled like the beak of a stork called ciconia or guanta, in the shape of forceps:
The extremities of theirs are made behind like lime or almonds.
And if it does not obey your effort with these forceps or instruments, accordingly it is necessary that you carve over the root and uncover all the flesh and introduce the instrument called atali, which is a small lever whose shape is this:
And it should be of short extremity, thick and small, and not be enveloped so that it will not break.
Therefore, if through this the root is forgotten, good it is; and otherwise, help yourself with these other instruments of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is a triangular extremity in which there is some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it is triangular and has a more subtle extremity.
And already you are helped with this instrument having two ramps of which this is the form, approximately as follows: and with other instruments which precede in shaving of teeth; for shortly it is made with this instrument which is assembled like a great hook, and this is the form:
of the triangular extremity bent or short, which has some thickness, and is not enveloped so that it will not break.
And other things you should know that the instruments of teeth are many and similar to each other.
But the skilled and subtle craftsmen in this art find for themselves according to what it means to them the operation and various illnesses; for they are of the illnesses to which the ancients did not give nor pause with their own proper instruments, due to the forms of diverse species.
But if the bone of the mandible or of other bones in the mouth is broken, or if you are uncertain, accordingly be very careful over that place where it is located and here is what is convenient for the instruments and forceps which we have said in the extraction of roots of teeth, and help yourself with the gesture of which this is the form:
And it should be in that place some thickness, little by little, and be strung or held in the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone of all is forgotten; and accordingly restore the place with medicines suitable for this.
But if there is a small crack in the bone, accordingly fix that crack and its blackness, and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter XXXII.
On the Cure of Teeth Elevated above Others.
When the teeth are elevated above their natural form and more so when they need to be treated in women and venerable old men; therefore it is necessary that you consider: if one tooth is next to another tooth, and it is not possible to join or bind them together, accordingly extract that one; but if it is annexed to another tooth, accordingly you should incise it with this instrument whose form is this; and it is similar to a pig's mouth, and made of Indian iron with a very sharp extremity.
And it should be your incision with which you incise that one in many days due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that it is not confused with another tooth.
And if it is an elevated tooth exposed to erosion, accordingly grind that one with Indian iron file whose form is this:
And it should be all of Indian iron and the edge slightly sharp; and it should have many small points like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth is ground gradually in many days with ease, so that there is not another tooth confused and decaying. And accordingly shape it at the end, and extract it with some rasors.
And if it is a tooth of which one part is broken and the tongue lies against it, accordingly grind that one until the sharpness of that fracture is removed and smoothed out, and be filled so that the tongue does not lie against nor corrupt the word.
Chapter XXXIII.
On the Restoration of Bad Teeth with Gold or Silver Filling.
When accidents happen to teeth before concussion and removal by percussion or falling, and the disease cannot strengthen on what remains, and you have treated that one with stiptic medicines, and it has not worked out your cure, accordingly in order that they may not decay, use a filling of gold and not silver, for silver becomes green and soon spoils within a few days, but gold never changes.
And the filling should be in such subtlety and thickness according to the quantity that can enter between the teeth; and the form of the application is this: take the filling and take twice as much of it between two healthy teeth, and accordingly increase it by two tortuosities of the filling between two bad ones, or if one or many, until it reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And accordingly iterate the process into the part from which you began, and strengthen your hand with ease and wisdom until it is not bad.
And accordingly tighten your grip with which you should fill the roots of teeth that do not decay.
And accordingly incise the superfluous extremities of the filling with forceps or toothpicks, and add those to each place with gesture, and convert them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the bad tooth, so that it does not cause injury to the tongue. And accordingly leave that one straight like Roman.
But if it is loosened or broken, strengthen that one or those with another filling in such a manner for all its time.
And this is the form of teeth and the figure of the filling of two healthy teeth and two bad ones, like these linked:
And when one returns or two in their places, and are grown again as we have recounted, and remain.
And only good craftsmen and wise ones can do this.
And sometimes it is fitted with some cause of the bones of a cow, and is made like the form of a tooth, and is placed in a location where the tooth will decay, and is strengthened as we have said, and remains and serves that one for a long time.
Chapter XXXIV.
On the Incision of the Ligament which goes to the Tongue and prohibits Speech.
This ligament which goes behind the tongue sometimes or is natural to it as one has, or accidental and happens by injury which is already consolidated.
And the operation is that you open the mouth of the patient, and lift their tongue, and accordingly incise that ligament nerve according to its latitude until the tongue is freed from its recentness.
But if in that one there is some hardness or nodulation, and this is caused by the consolidation of injury, accordingly you should take a thread and divide it according to its latitude until you have divided the ligament and dissolved the nodulation.
And be careful that there is not a fissure made in the forehead of the flesh, and that you do not cut too deeply and cause a flow of blood.
And accordingly wash the vestige of the incision with lukewarm water or warm water or cold water, and accordingly pause leaving the tongue free; thus is the manner in which the patient should leave their tongue loose every night, so that it may not consolidate again.
But if a flow of blood occurs, pause over the place with a powder made from vitriol; but if the blood runs, accordingly cauterize the place with a lanuginous cautery that is suitable for this. And accordingly cure that one with other causes until it is healed.
Chapter XXXV.
On the Extraction of Ranula behind the Tongue.
Sometimes, behind the tongue, an abscess forms like a small boil, prohibiting the tongue from its natural operation; and soon it is greatly swollen to fill up the mouth.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, sitting in front of the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it of a fiery or black color, hard and dry, to which the patient does not have a sense, accordingly do not touch it, for it is gangrenous.
And if it is whitened and has humidity, accordingly you put a hook in there, and incise that one with a subtle spatula, and incise it from all sides; and if blood runs during your operation, accordingly you pause above with a powder made of vitriol, until the bleeding is stopped.
And accordingly return to your work until you have treated it with a filling of gold and salt, and cure that one with the other cure suitable for this, until it is healed.
Chapter XXXVI.
On the Extraction of Abscesses from both Ears and that one which is nothing in the Gullet and other Abscesses.
When it occurs in the Gullet, so are the glands which are assembled like an almond, which grows outside and is named two Ears, which when you cure them with what we have said in the division, and they do not get better, accordingly you consider if the abscess is hard, of a fiery color, of little sensation, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is of a red color and the root is thick, accordingly do not touch it with iron because of the flow of blood; but leave it until it has ripened, and then either you will break it or it will break itself.
And if it is of a white color, rough and the root of it is subtle, accordingly that one must be incised.
And the operation is that you consider, before your operation, if the abscess has already rested or is still incomplete; and accordingly make the patient sit in front of the sun, with their head in its natural position, and open their mouth, and the servant takes between his fingers the tongue of the patient behind the instrument which has this form:
And it is made of silver or iron, and it is subtle like a knife.
Then as you take the tongue and it is shown to you the abscess, and cut around that with a thread, accordingly take a hook and place that one in the mouth, and pull that out to the outer parts as much as you can. Or another thing that pulls some cause of the tunics, and accordingly incise that one with an instrument which has this form:
Or another thing that pulls some cause of the tunics, and accordingly incise that one with an instrument which has this form: and it is assembled like forceps, however the extremities of it are curved, so that the orifice of each of those is in the inside of the other, very sharp, made of Indian iron wrapped.
But if this instrument is not present to you, accordingly incise that one with a spatula of which this is the form: And it should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have incised one notch, incise the other in the same manner of incision, and accordingly make the patient gargle with cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, make the patient gargle with a decoction of scoria from mulberry or myrtle leaves and similar to those of stiptic causes, until the bleeding stops, and accordingly cure that one until it is healed.
And sometimes there are other abscesses in the gullet besides those two ears, and incise those according to what I have said in the incision of two notches equally.
And you had already treated a woman with an abscess which was born in her gullet, which abscess tended towards a fiery color, of little sensation, which had already closed up her gullet, and the woman breathed very tightly, and had already prohibited herself from eating and drinking water, and was already on the verge of death if you had not acted for one day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had formed two hollows, almost like two tunnels.
So you carefully guided the instrument and placed it in one of the hollows, and pulled it out, and drew out a large portion, and accordingly you incised that one so as to understand the other tunnel, and accordingly you opened the mouth of her, and compressed her tongue, and accordingly you inserted the instrument into that abscess.
And accordingly you cut off a large part of it, and there was only a little blood flowing from it. So the gullet of that woman is now absolute, and she began to drink water immediately, and accordingly started eating food again. And you did not stop incising that abscess many times over a long period, and a new abscess formed in its place, which was incised until it was prolonged.
So you made haste and cauterized the gullet of her, then added another step; and accordingly you walked away and did not know what God had done for that woman through me.
Chapter XXXVII.
On the Incision of a Hernia when it is Abscessed.
When the catarrh settles in the hernia, and it is abscessed and long, accordingly it is named perpendicular; and if it is on the left side large and rounded, accordingly it is called a bubo.
But when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and your cure does not confirm, and only sometimes that abscess is left behind and is subtle, accordingly you must incise that which is added rounded; and if it is to that length, and is bloody, of a fiery color or black, and there is no sensation to it, accordingly you must take care in cutting into it, for in that case there is fear over the patient.
And when you take that one according to the manner which I have said of its whiteness and length, so that you make the patient gag and press their tongue with an instrument whose form is as follows: And accordingly place the hook in the new abscess, and pull it down and incise it with one of the two instruments which are described in the incision of two notches.
And you must not incise that one but only up to the point where it is adjusted on the natural term with addition, for if you incise more of it, you will ruin their speech.
And accordingly the incision, use what we have recounted in the incision of two notches, and cure that one until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision of it, you must use a gentle hand in the cauterization of it without fear, and the manner of the cautery on it is nothing but with sharp water, and it is that you pause the head of the patient in its natural position, and accordingly press their tongue with the instrument which we have said, and accordingly take the water which we have said in the chapter on cauterization, and confirm it with live cause, and pause it not thick nor subtle, and fill the concavity of the instrument whose form is as follows:
And accordingly the extremity of it is concave in which the medicine is paused just like the concavity of a spoon, and pause the instrument with the medicine on the vulva, and the patient lies on their side for so that the saliva or mouthpiece of the mouth of that one flows by the intrinsic medicine, so that it does not descend from any cause over the gullet of him and trouble that one.
And accordingly take your time and apply the medicine, and press it onto the uvula for the space of a half hour until you see it to be blackened and calmed by the biting of the medicine.
And if you wish, take a cloth and wrap that around the extremity of the ray, and immerse the cloth in the medicine, and insert the ray with the cloth into a tube above so that the cloth adheres to that tube, and do this as many times until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and accordingly let it be as is when it dries up and falls off after three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and accordingly cauterize the abscess in the circuit of the uvula with a cloth wrapped around it, and purify that one by washing it with the medicine, and be washed with cold water, and be treated on the outside with an embrocation, and inside with gargling until it is healed.
And this kind of treatment is more saving than incision and more free from fear.
And sometimes the uvula is cured with this which is more subtle than cauterization and incision, for it is treated by sub-fumigation in this manner: take calament, saffron, origan, rue, scented Arabics, camomile, and similar to those of herbs, and adjust all these causes, or some of them, into a bowl, and immerse them in cold water, and boil; and the bowl is well mixed with decent mixing, and there is a hole in the middle of the bowl on which is placed an iron instrument according to this manner; it is made of silver or iron.
And be inserted the extremity into the mouth of the patient until the vapor comes to the uvula on the tongue, until the uvula is very much obscured.
And accordingly repeat on that many times until it is dry, and take care not to make this treatment at the beginning of the appearance of abscesses, for too much would adhere to the abscess, and you should not do that, but rather declare the presence of the abscess before doing so.
But if this instrument is not present to you, accordingly take a reed and compose in the extremity of it a bundle of rushes, so that the mouth of the patient is blocked, for the bundle of rushes prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter XXXVIII.
On the Extraction of Thorns and of that which adheres in the Gullet and other Causes.
Many times thorns adhere in the gullet or thorn of flesh or some other cause.
Then you must extract what is apparent from those things, on which the sight falls, because you press the tongue with an instrument in front of the sun, so that it may be declared to you what is in the gullet.
And what does not appear and is hidden to you in the gullet, you must make the patient vomit before food is digested in the stomach, because very likely the annexed cause of the gullet will be forgotten through vomiting; or that the patient takes a piece of nap or rizut of lettuce or a mouthful of dry bread; or take a piece of sea sponge and tie it tightly with a thread, and accordingly have the patient swallow it, so that when it reaches the place where thorns are and is extracted, you will forget them. And also take a snake and tie it with a thread, and have it swallowed and then extracted from the inside; or take a pipe and have it inserted and then pulled out.
But if you do not forget those causes which we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form:
And it is more thick than a hair, and in the extremity of it be a concavity which you insert into the patient's gullet with ease.
And the tip of it is raised upwards and watch out that you touch the bone of the throat, for fear that it will enter the body and with it the bone or spine, or that it will put its hand on the patient.
But on the other hand, if the patient inserts it is sweet, through their knowledge of the place of the annexed cause and pulls it down, and takes its hand with the instrument upwards, all according to the quantity that is prepared until it is forgotten.
Chapter XXXIX.
On the Extraction of Blood-Sugar attached to the Gullet.
When the blood-sucking is medicated with what we have said in the division of cure by medicines and does not confirm, consider then that the patient's gullet is towards the sun, because you have compressed the tongue of it with an instrument which we have recommended to you.
So if you take out the blood-sucking, extract it with a small hook or subtle gestures decently.
And if it is not possible to extract with that, then take a concave tube and insert it into the patient's gullet, and accordingly pause in the concavity of the tube an iron rod lit, and do this as many times (until the blood-sucking is dead and falls out of the gullet) and abstain from giving water to the patient for all day.
And accordingly take a vial full of cold water, and open the mouth of it in that, and wash the mouth with that; and do not cause any harm or trouble to come from that, nor speak for an hour afterwards with your own hand, because the blood-sucking will soon become aware of the water's presence.
But if it is not forgotten with what we have recommended, then sub-fumigate the patient with cypress or asafoetida through an instrument which we have recommended in the sub-fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, and then it will fall.
And it is another way of operating in the sub-fumigation of that one, is that you take a bowl in which are ignited coals and the bowl is covered with a cover in the middle of which is a hole, and the extremity of the instrument is placed in that hole; and accordingly let it be above the sub-fumigation; and have the patient put their mouth into the extremity of the tube, and close their mouth so that the sub-fumigation is not forgotten until you know that the sub-fumigation has reached the blood-sucking, for the blood-sucking will soon fall.
And if it does not work, then you must repeat the sub-fumigation many times, and abstain from giving water to the patient, and make them eat salty and bitter things, and not beg for water, and thus it is necessary that this regimen be forgotten.
And this is the form of the instrument with which blood-sucking is extracted from the gullet when it is visible; and it is similar to forceps just like those, except that there is some curvature in it. The which is placed in the gullet, and the extremity of it is similar to the beak of a stork, which is guarded, with a sharp lime edge, so that when I compress any cause, it will not let go.
Chapter XL.
In which is the summary of the sermon in warning about abscesses and their treatment.
The abscesses are many species, of many manners, according to the memory of them, each one in this book.
And thus diverse in perforation and section of them by two manners, of which one is by the species of abscesses themselves; and therefore that we compress of moistures.
And the second manner is for the locations in which they occur in the body, because an abscess occurring on the head is different from one occurring on the buttocks; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy location is different from one occurring at a joint; and each of them has its own judgment by operation.
And besides, there are some abscesses that should not be perforated but rather allowed to mature naturally in those places or complete their course.
So other abscesses that must be pierced when they are crossed, and not allowed to mature according to their natural course, just like those that are related to joints, for an abscess that occurs near a joint is prolonged within the circuit of it, and soon corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing contraction of that member; or it is an abscess near a main limb, and if you delay piercing it until it has matured too much in relation to the main limb; or it is near the buttocks, then pierce it unripe; and do not pierce it when it is ripe, but only that which is related to the buttocks, so that the pressure of it does not push through and become elongated at the edges of the buttocks, causing a fistula to form, or that it is formed in the term of it so that it will not heal. But you must know the time for piercing the abscess, and that is when it has matured.
And you must know that it is mature when there is a decrease in the pain and cessation of the fever, and accordingly a decrease in the swelling and pulse, and sharpness at the top of the abscess, and other signs.
And when you must know that piercing should take place in the most distant part of the abscess and from the coming of cure to the prominence.
And piercing should be done through the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the muscles or fat, and in places where there is no reflection; for in those that are reflected, use piercing according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy location, then it is better to let the perforation be done at that point until the digestion of it is confirmed according to its natural course, just as we have said; for if you pierce it before that, the body will prolong itself in pushing out the pus and much dirty matter, and soon the lips of it will become hardened and the depth of it.
But some abscesses are pierced according to the latitude of the flesh or body as necessity demands, or according to that from which the member is in need.
And you must administer a small perforation for small abscesses, and a large perforation and many sections for large abscesses, according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And there are others of the abscesses in which it is necessary to make a concave incision and be careful, when it is made as if pan and fat are in term, just like those that occur in troops of boils and boils.
And of those that are incised with a section having three angles; and of those that is incised like the figure of myrtle leaves, just like the abscesses of the gouty.
And of those that are administered with a round section and a lunar section, and similar to those.
But that one which is not like the abscesses of the lion's skin, superficially, you must pierce it with a superficial or flat piercing only.
And you must pierce it when the abscess is large and has gathered much pus, so that you do not hesitate to drain out all the pus at that moment; having drained one part of it, and accordingly, fill the abscess with pus again the next day, and accordingly, drain out a greater part, and accordingly, make many appearances according to gradation until it is forgotten.
And most especially if the patient is a young man or woman, or a child, or an old person in decline, because the animal spirit many times is resolved with the exit of pus, and soon the patient will die, and you should open them.
Therefore, guard this chapter with great caution, and accordingly, administer your piercing in which you pierce these abscesses, so that you may wash away the plagues and consider then if the plague of the abscess is small, or it is a flat section, then you must administer some of those remedies from olden times; and if the abscess is great, and the fissures of the piercing are many, then you must pause in each hole until they all come together.
And if in the abscess one part of the cord is cut off or you have concaved it in the circuit, then you must fill it with old cloth or a piece of cloth made from linen, just like when you drain pans or rags, with their moisture; and strengthen that within three days; and accordingly, process that and cure it with whatever medicine is needed for the bandages until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during the time of your operation, then you must administer cold water and vinegar mixed with linen cloths, and pause that over the location of the bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must administer a regimen and treatment, and powder those which I have recommended in many places of this our book and division.
But if it is in the time of winter, and the location of the abscess is a location of many nerves, then you must apply poultices made with wine and oil, carefully heated, and pause those over the locations.
And if it is in summer, and the locations are fleshy, then you must apply poultices soaked with water and oil or with wine and oil, and all that should be cold until the third day, just as we have said, and then you must dissolve the abscess and wash away that and administer whatever medicine is needed for it to heal.
And thus is what is necessary for the knowledge of the cure of abscesses universally, but according to the way of distinction which I have said about each type of abscess in its own chapter.
Chapter XLII.
On the Section of Abscesses which come on the Cord of the Head.
In the cord of the head, small abscesses, and kinds of nodes which contain tunics that are at their disposal; and there are many species of them.
And among them are pimples, and those that contain moisture similar to lime. And among those that contain moisture similar to powder, and resembling their own; and those that are lithoid, hard.
And in the section of all, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, as you must not make the extraction contrary to the natural movement.
And the operation in section of those is that you express them with an instrument which has a form similar to this, which is called a "entromes", until you know what they contain.
So if that which is contained is humidity, then you must divide it with a section according to length, by a superficial section in this form:
And begins on the line of .B. to the line of .G. Then when the humidity is evacuated, you must excoriate that part which contains that humidity, and do not leave any cause remaining from it, for many times the same thing returns, if some cause remains from it.
And accordingly, submerge the cloth in Egyptian poultice, if present, and if not, in water and salt; and fill it with that which covers the wound and leave it to sit for another day, for by this method you will corrode all that remains of that peel.
And accordingly, iterate over that cloth with Egyptian poultice secondly and thirdly if necessary, until you are confident that there is no remaining cause of that peel; then cure the wound with poultice until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, then you must incise it according to this form: with a section having the form of a cross, and make one incision between two lips of the section and scrape out all that part, and exert your skill in extracting the tunic which contains it.
But if your natural movement makes opposition, then do what I have previously recounted first.
And similarly do in the lithoid abscess of section and cure according to what we have said; and the section over the lithoid abscess is more gentle, since it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes some of these abscesses which are in the head of certain men, who have no moisture; the cause of which is that you excised over an abscess on the head of an old woman and tore it apart as if with a deafening, harsh, white sound, which could not be trilled, and if anyone else had struck at it, it would have caused harm.
But in other abscesses that occur on the head, this is not the same chapter, just as those abscesses that come to the heads of children and affect the ears, but the section of all these shall be a superficial section.
And pause the piercing in those from the lower part of them, so that it may be alleviated to the body of the pus in the lower parts.
And accordingly, cure those with whatever is necessary for their cure.
Chapter XLII.
On the Section of Scrofulae which occur in the Neck.
Many times these abscesses occur in the neck and armpits and groins; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, and many that are generated between them, and all scrofulae of these is enclosed within its own tunic, and just like in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the species of these scrofulae are many, for some are lithoid, and some contain humidity, and some are malignant which do not obey to cure.
Therefore, in that one which you find to be of good disposition in the Touching, of which the color is manifest and is proper to the cord, and is spread out to all parts, and is not annexed to the nerve of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the natural movement, and does not protrude, it is necessary that you incise that with a superficial section from above to below the body of the line of .G. to the line of .B., and scrape out all that part, and extend two lips of the cord with one incision, or with many incisions if you have need of them, just as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And be more cautious that the vein or nerve is not incised.
And be the spatula not too sharp, that it does not adjust to your touch and incision, or that it annoys the patient, or that you incise something that is not necessary to incise; for if you incise a vein or nerve and prohibit your operation, then pause in the wound, and apply vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and strengthen the wound, and leave it alone until the acuteness of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes softened and begins to heal. When the blood is drained.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And accordingly, inquire about the sign which your teacher has indicated if there remains any cause of the other small scrofulae, then incise those and clean them.
And if it is in the root of a great vein, then you must not incise that scrofula from its root. Abandon it and let it fall gently, and let it drop down without causing any harm.
And accordingly, fill the wound with old cloth which you have already submerged in Egyptian poultice, and accordingly, cure it.
And if you incise that whole scrofula, then you must adjust the two lips of the wound and suture them together as soon as possible so that there is no remaining superfluity.
But if you find that there remains superfluity due to the greatness of the scrofula, then you must understand how to incise its root, and extract it and administer suture and do what is said.
And that of the scrofulae which contain humidity, pierce it with a superficial piercing at the location where it appears to you as the place of maturity, and pause the piercing of that which is situated below the body, just as we have said.
And accordingly, administer piercing, hot and similar to those, in order that it may corrode what remains of the corruption. And accordingly, when you see the wound already cleansed, then you must cure it with poultice of generative flesh until it is healed.
Chapter XLIII.
On the Section of the Pith of the Abscess which occurs in the Gouty Joint.
They said that the ancients called this section "epilhot", and we have not seen any man in our land who has done so.
And this is the inscription of the sermon of those.
But in those who have goutiness, it is necessary to avoid the extraction of the epilhot, because through this, there would be no help, since all the veins and major vessels of the malady are here.
But in those who have abscesses in the mouth or gouty joint or both ears, when the disease is not in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of epilhot to avoid the loss which is caused by perforation.
Therefore, when we wish to do this, it is necessary that we incise the epilhot behind three circles of the circles of the epilhot, or four with a small section by latitude in that which is between two circles in quantity, so that the section be on ciphac, not on cartilage, and this location is suitable for section, because it is deprived of flesh and the vessels of blood are there.
And if the doctor is hesitant, then it is necessary that he stretches the cord of the gouty joint with one incision, and accordingly, makes an opening in the cord until it reaches the canal, but avoids the vessels of blood if he sees any cause of those.
And accordingly, incise the ciphac according to what we have recounted; and it is signified on the section of the canal by the flame which comes from that place with water that is broken off and by the abscission of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the hour is ripe in which perforation is feared, add two lips to the cord of the wound, and sew it up alone except for the cartilage.
And accordingly, administer medicines that make the flesh healthy until it is healed.
And I, Albucasis, say that the sum of this sermon which we have recounted is an exposition only to show you that some of these abscesses have already filled the gouty joint of the patient, and the disease has come to death, and the breath of life is exhausted, and some are going to incise the epiglottis so that the diseased person can breathe over the location of the wound through some respiration, and be saved from death.
And for this reason, I command you to leave the wound open until the wickedness of the disease is consumed; and it is the wickedness of life for three days; and therefore, I command you to close the wound, and cure that which is not yet healed.
And what you have seen through me, is that a servant took a cotelet and placed it in his gouty joint and incised with it a part of the canal of the lung, and I was called to the cure of him, and found the patient thus as if he were already dead, and discovered the wound and found the blood which had flowed from the wound small.
Therefore, I was confessed that he had not incised a vein nor guided, and the breath came from the wound, and cured him until he was healed.
And not a single accident befell the servant except that his voice raged, and accordingly, after some days, he returned to improvement in his physical condition.
And now I say to you that in the section of the epilhot there is no fear.
Chapter XLIV.
On the Section regarding an Abscess which occurs in the Gouty Joint outside, and is called Hernia of the Gouty Joint.
This abscess named hernia of the gouty joint is a great abscess according to the color of the body, and it is more common in women.
And it is according to two manners, either natural or accidental.
And in the natural one, there is no hope of curing.
And the accidental one is according to two manners of which one is similar to nodes like grasses, and the other manner is similar to an abscess that is caused by occlusion of an artery, and in that there is fear. And it does not behoove one to presume upon it as with iron, but only in that which is small. And you must proceed with it and investigate it according to the said, and if you find it similar to grassy nodes, and it is not suspended from any of the veins, then you incise it just like the nodes, and extract it with water that contains the peel and bursicle; and otherwise, you must search for all its being, and accordingly, cure the location where it needs care until it is healed.
Chapter XLV.
On the Section of the Species of Nodes.
Of the nodes, I have already said many species and all their species in the division.
And it is necessary that you recount thus the difference between node and excrescence, as one might have doubt.
Therefore, I say that in an excrescence there is heat and fever and violent pains until the ebullition of the superfluity is calmed; and it is completed putrefaction which causes the fever to cease, the pain, and the heat.
But in a node there is no heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that ciphac lion which is at the sac proper.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a cheese and it is made thus as if it were a vacuum, whether major or minor, and they are according to two species, either grassy and containing humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, according to what I said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the cure of a node, it is necessary that you expose it and inquire about it at the beginning with a instrument which is called an intro-mes, according to what will come in the chapter which is proper to this one.
And it is the manner of inquiring into abscesses and all nodes, which is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you turn these digits with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated to the cord.
And accordingly, lastly, your hand according to the measure of the greatness of the abscess, and accordingly, extract the instrument and observe what is situated in the vestige of it.
And if the superfluous moisture is forgotten, of whatever color it may be, then you must incise it with a superficial section according to what I said in other abscesses.
And if from the vestige of the instrument there is no moisture, then you know that it is fat.
And dry it over with a section having the form of a cross according to this form: Just as you have been taught, and suspend it with onces, and excise the cord of all parts with facility, and preserve the skin or sac, if possible, over that and extract that pus from the node.
But if it is broken in the operation, it is not possible to extract that pus, and many times there will be a mess, and accordingly, you must extract it piecemeal until there remains no cause from it.
Therefore, if there remains no cause from it, little or too much, the node will return as before.
And if you find that there remains a small part from it, then complete the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and strengthen the wound, and pause over that which holds the abscess cautiously, and cure that from another cure until it is healed.
And if it is a great node, then you must sew the two lips of it and cure that with what nourishes.
But if the pulsating vein is on the contrary side, or non-pulsating, then you must compress and strengthen the location of the gauze which is vitriol and leave it thus for two days or three until the wound is peaceful and the ebullition of blood subsides; and accordingly, return to incising what remains of the node.
Chapter XLVI.
On the Forms of the Instruments Necessary for Section and Perforation.
Of those, there are the forms of intro-meses, and three species: that of the great ones, of the medium-sized ones, and of the small ones.
The form of the great intro-mes is this:
The form of the small intro-mes is this:
Are made of iron, with a flattened end and rounded extremities, in order that they may be inserted into abscesses.
And these are the forms of the experienced ones, and are named "albered", and one of those is called "berid".
And there are three species, which are great, medium-sized, and small.
The form of the great experienced one is this:
The form of the medium-sized experienced one is this:
The form of the small experienced one is this:
Conveniently, these are for those abscesses and excrescences and fistulas and buboes, so that among them are those of the bones and from other causes.
And they are made rounded, thick, and lion-like, like large needles with which the slits are sewn, and they are made of citrus wood, or horn, or iron, or silver, And the best ones are when they are made of citrus wood.
And they are made by experienced craftsmen of black horn, which are suitable for those in which the fistulas are abundant in the concavity of which there are reflections that are reflected to their lightness and those reflections.
And there are three species, which are some long ones, and others medium-sized, and others short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and its constriction.
Form of the great experienced one of lead:
Form of the medium-sized experienced one of lead:
Form of the small experienced one of lead:
The forms of the onces are many species, which are some simple ones, which have only one curvature, and there are three species: great ones, small ones, and medium-sized ones.
And among them are onces of horn, and of three species.
And among those are onces that have two curvatures, and of three species.
And among those are onces that have three curvatures, and of three species.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Form of a small simple once, this:
Form of a great once with two curvatures, this: Form of a medium-sized once with two curvatures, this: Form of a small once with two curvatures, this:
Form of a great once with three curvatures, this:
Form of a medium-sized once with three curvatures, this:
And these are the forms of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are sectioned and excised, and there are three species: great ones, medium-sized ones, and small ones.
Form of a great scalpel:
Form of a medium-sized scalpel:
Form of a small scalpel:
The extremities of those with which the section is made are sharp and the other extremities are not sharp, and they are not paused in this manner, but so that it may be done gently in the excision of the nodes, lest there be an incision of a vein or nerve, and for these reasons the patient is healed and finds tranquility little by little as a result of the adjustment which he finds necessary for the excision of the abscess.
And these are the forms of handles, and there are three species: great ones, medium-sized ones, and small ones, just like eyes.
Are made of wood and resemble a ray, in which also alcohol is distilled.
And it has a small puncture on the left-hand side, hidden by a spatula, and in that it runs through the partitions within and without, when you wish, just as you see.
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers as one performs the incision of abscesses and does not perceive the patients, and there are three species: great ones, medium-sized ones, and small ones. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of forceps with which the flow of blood is absconded, and there are three species: great ones, medium-sized ones, and small ones; the forms of them are this:
Are made of citrus wood, rounded with some length, and are subtle.
And it is necessary that there be these species of forceps for you: great ones, medium-sized ones, and small ones, so that through those you can abscond the flow of blood with speed in necessity, and accordingly, when your first intention is not medicine.
However, you do not use those to abscond blood in every part of the body, and you only use them in fleshy places, just like on the thighs of women and on the arms, and on the breasts, and on the belly, and in the groin, and similar to their own flesh.
And sometimes they are made of those small instruments resembling scissors according to this form; through which the blood is absconded when it is done by phlebotomy, or incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made rounded according to this form:
Chapter XLVII.
On the treatment of men's breasts which are similar to women's.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become inflated as they begin to be flaccid, and accordingly the breasts are inflated, and similar to those of women, and roughened, and apostematous, distant.
And to the one who suffers from this, it is necessary that you incise those with a lunar section according to this form, between the lines of B and G, and accordingly excise all the roughness, and accordingly fill the wound with an incarnated medicine, and accordingly adjust the two lips of the wound with suturing, and cure him until he is healed.
But if the breast declines into its folds and is softened by its magnitude, just like in women, then it is necessary that it be divided into two parts, each of which will be contained within the other, until the major line contains the minor one according to this form, between the lines of B and G. And accordingly excise the cord which is between the two lips of the wound, and stop the swelling, and administer what we have said about suturing and the powders that are necessary for healing, until he is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of what needs to be cut due to the anxiety of the patient and the flow of blood, then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a submerge in corrosive gruel, and leave him until the corrosion that remains from the grease has dried, and accordingly cure him until he is healed.
Chapter XLVIII.
On the perforation of abscesses that come forth with a little titillation.
Those abscesses that come forth with a little titillation are of the species of scrofulas, which are hard and contain a sack.
And some of those contain humidity; and those that contain humidity must be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from the line G to the line B. And when all the pus has been evacuated from the abscess, then you must fill it with a warm poultice and leave it until the next day.
And accordingly, the poultice should be kept and cured with a suitable ointment to that, until he is healed.
And if the abscess is of the species of nodes and scrofulas, then you must cut on top of it just as we have said in the section on scrofulas equally.
And if the wound is extended in such a way that it would become inflamed, then you must apply a cauterization according to what we have said before.
Chapter XLIX.
On the section of abscesses that occurs through artery or vein.
When the artery is broken and the cord that is on top of it is consolidated, then many times an abscess occurs. And the signs by which one can recognize that the inflammation and abscess are due to the artery or vein: for when the abscess is caused by the artery, it becomes long and aggregated in the preone of the body; and when you incise the abscess with those fingers, you will feel a stridor.
And that which is caused by the vein is rounded to the surface of the body.
And the section on this abscess is an error, and more so in those who are left with the aisselhas (nipples), and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very great, therefore it is necessary to avoid its cure with iron, and that which is in the extremities or at the head should be avoided.
But on that which is caused by the inflammation of the orifice of the artery, you must incise the cord in the length; and accordingly, cut off the section with scissors and approach the artery, and deliver the tunics until it is uncovered.
And accordingly, make an incision on that aglet and cause it to penetrate into the other side, and strengthen the artery with a double ligature in two places, which is the cause of your headache in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
And accordingly, push the place between two ligatures with a spatula until all the blood that is in it flows out and the abscess is dissolved.
And accordingly, administer the cure in which the poultice is generated until the ligatures come off; and accordingly, cure him with suitable ointments to that, until he is healed.
And if the abscess is due to a section of vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand the water that is at your disposal from the abscess and the cord, and accordingly, insert the needle behind the place where you have held with your hand; and cause it to penetrate; and be in that file double until you extract it from the other side; and accordingly, tie the abscess with two ligaments as I have said to you on the ligament of a grape of two parts with two extremities of the thread.
But if you fear that we will extract the thread, then accordingly introduce a ligature with that needle behind all the abscess, and strengthen those ligatures in four places.
And accordingly, cut the abscess in the middle of it so that when what is inside it is taken out, then you will incise the excess of the cord, and leave what is left tied.
And accordingly, pause over the poultice which you have submerged in vinegar and oil, and accordingly administer the cure which is made with some and ointments until he is healed.
Chapter 1 on the abscess that occurs due to twisting of nerves.
Just as the abscess occurs in the artery and vein, and similarly the abscess occurs in the nerves when it occurs in their percussion or occurs due to excessive travail, and for similar reasons.
And it is made in the most part of those places where the joints are inflamed or swollen, or in any place where the junctures are troubled.
And it is a great abscess, and it is colored like the other flesh, and it is in the major part of those places where there are no joints or ligaments, and when it is stretched with great vehemence, one feels in that place as if the patient were in a state of stupor.
And it is not an abscess aggregated in the preone of the body, and therefore it is left with the cord, and he is troubled on all sides and does not go to any parts before or behind.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be incised with iron, for very little would it bring about contraction.
But that which is on the head or forehead must be cut off with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then you should take out the contents and abscessed parts with forceps.
And if it is large, then you should suspend the abscess with a ligature, and excise that part, and accordingly stop that; and adjust the wound with a suture, and cure him until he is healed.
Chapter LI.
On the section of abscess which occurs in the navel region and extends to the abdomen.
I have observed in some men, many times, in the bellies of those and in other parts of the bodies of those, which are called fungals by similarity to fungi, whose roots are subtle and the head is thick; and already the lips of those are conversed, and it is one of those that is small, and one of those that is very magnificent.
And I have already seen one, and in the belly of that there were two fungi-like growths, which resembled fungi, and there was no difference between them, white and having a thin root.
And already the lips of those were turned inward and split open, and moisture flowed from it all the time.
Therefore, you should incise them and cut into the one in pieces that weigh 18 ounces. and the other weighs 6 ounces.
And the operation in the incision of them is that you consider whether the patient is humid, and the color of those fungi is white, humid, with a subtle root; then you should incise it with a spatula, lat, and be present at the cauterization by fire, for many times you must expel much blood from the section; and if you see the blood flow, cauterize that.
And if the patient is pale and trembling, be careful not to incise with iron; but take a leaden thread, freshly made, and strengthen it on that fungi, according to the manner which we have said; and leave it for two days.
And accordingly, adjust it in the constriction of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to strengthen the lead greatly on that fungi, until it is abscessed and falls off by itself without further travail.
But if the fungi has a thick root, then in the incision of it there is some cause for fear and dread, especially in that which is in the belly.
But it is possible that you may cut off most of it, and accordingly, cauterize it so that it does not return.
And accordingly, cure him until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to presume to incise that fungi which is of a dark color, with little sense, and without regard, for that is an abominable cancer.
And you will find an account of cancerous growth in this way.
Chapter LII.
On the cure of a swelling at the navel.
The swelling at the navel is caused by many factors; either by fissures of the skin which is over the belly, and one sees it as a thread or budle according to what happens in other ruptures; or by blood flowing from a vein or artery, as has been said before, or by a ventral constriction in that place.
But if it is caused by a fissure of the skin and by swelling of the navel, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body; and there is no pain, but rather an appearance of different situations. And if it is caused by the ejection of the budle, then the situation of that abscess with water as we have recounted, with a more violent diversity; and when you press it with the forceps said to be hidden, and accordingly returns; and very quickly it becomes like that, and is greatly magnified in many ways.
But if it is due to humidity, then there is no pain and it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constrained or swollen.
And if it is due to blood, then accordingly with these signs the abscess appears declining towards blackness.
But if it is due to flesh nothingness, then accordingly there is a great abscess, thick and hard, and it forms according to a certain quantity.
But if it is due to constriction, then accordingly the sensation of that place is painful.
And the operation in this case is that you consider whether the swelling at the navel is due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or constriction; then you must be prohibited from curing it, for in that case there is fear and dread as I have taught you in the chapter where I spoke of abscesses caused by arteries and veins.
And if the swelling at the navel is due to the budle or the skin, then you must command the patient to hold his breath and be standing upright; and accordingly, make an incision in a circular motion around the entire navel, and accordingly, command him to stand with his back bent between your hands on his shoulders, and accordingly, surround it with a spatula lat in a circular motion around the location you have marked with the incision; and accordingly, cut off most of the abscess into the upper parts with scissors large; and accordingly, tie it in a circle with strong thread or with cedars and do it decently.
And accordingly, take the middle of the abscess extended over the ligature and insert the said thread into that indicated place and seek the budle; and if you have not found or guarded it by the ligature, then you should extract the alxorati and push the budle into the parts inward from the belly.
And if you have found the skin, then take it with scissors; and incise the excess parts of it.
But if it is contrary to your artery or vein, then you must circle around that much, and accordingly return to your operation; and take two needles and insert them into those two strong threads and enter two needles into the circuit which you have made around the abscess in a cross-like manner, so that they may penetrate; and accordingly, strengthen the abscess in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the location until the flesh extends and falls off on its own; or incise it when it is softened and can be removed, and accordingly cure it with water as needed until it is healed.
And if the swelling at the navel is due to flesh nothingness or humidity, then you must conquer the abscess as we have said and extract the blood or humidity which you find in it, and accordingly cure it with water as needed and consolidate the location.
Chapter LIII.
On the cure of cancer.
We have already said in the division, about the species of cancer and how it is brought to the cure through medicines, and what is a safeguard in it for the cure with iron so that it is not ulcerated; and we have said that cancer is generated in the majority and caution of the cure of it.
And the ancients said that some times cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, just as in the case of breast or womb cancer and its likenesses on the limbs, which can be removed entirely, especially when it begins small.
But when it is old and great, you must not take possession of it, for I have never seen or heard of anyone curing it, nor has it ever reached that point.
And the operation in this case is when it is located as we have said, that you precede and leave the patient and purge him with black cholera some times, and accordingly sign him, if a manifest fullness has been found.
And accordingly, prepare the patient with preparation in which it is located for operation, and accordingly prohibit it from using any sharp instruments that would cause harm to him; and accordingly concave all parts with a good scalpel excision so that no cause of its roots remains. And accordingly, let the blood flow, and do not abscess it slightly, and remove the places, and wash away the thick blood with your hand or with an instrument that is at your disposal among the instruments.
But if it causes great bleeding from the incision of a vein or artery, then accordingly cauterize that area until the flow of blood is stopped, and accordingly cure it with another cure until it is healed.
Chapter LIV.
On the cure of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, about the species of dropsy caused by water, and the signs of each species, and the cure for it with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of althitas alone, and it is not approached by iron to the species of timpanistres or to the species of yposearcha, for this is mortal.
And when you have already medicated this species of dropsy timpanistre with medicines and do not confirm your medication, then accordingly consider whether the patient has already been debilitated, or is suffering from another disease, just as if it is in the throat or chest and similar to those, then accordingly be careful not to medicine him with iron, for fear is over this.
But if you find the patient to be of exuberant virtue, and in him there is no other disease but dropsy alone, and he is not a child or an old man, then accordingly the manner of operation for him is that you raise the patient between your hands, and give him accordingly to drink expelling his stomach with his own hand, filling the water at the outlet of the pentenilh, and accordingly take a spatula with spines according to this form:
...two sharp points long, with an acute extremity like a spatula; but however be in it some slight shortness gradually, so that in the operation with him it does not pass into the budle, and lead him.
And accordingly consider if the generation of dropsy is from one of the budels, for then you must with the section go away from the navel by the quantity of three times as much to the parts left behind, on the right side of him above the pentenilh.
But if the generation of dropsy is due to illness of the liver, then accordingly your section will be on the left side of the navel for three times.
And if the generation of it is due to melissa, then accordingly your section will be on the right side.
And it is not necessary that your section be on the side where the patient wishes to lie down, so that the superfluities do not flow towards that location.
And accordingly, pierce the entire codon with an instrument and enter into that section, and lift your hand with a spatula between the coden and the siphac, and you excise it; and if it is the quantity of one fingernail or thereabouts.
And accordingly, pierce the skin until the spatula reaches the location where you want it to be, which is the location of water. And accordingly, extract that and enter an instrument which has this form: ...and it is similar to a silver canula; it is made of silver or of iron or of lead lion, to which at the lower part of it is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two from one side and one from the other side; and fashioned is the extremity of it incised according to the manner of plumage, just as you see:
And in the extremity of it above is an armilla, for when the instrument reaches the water, accordingly that armilla will immediately descend upon the instrument, thus evacuating from the water just about the right quantity, for if you evacuate more than necessary at that hour, very soon the patient will die by resolution of his animal spirit, or suffer an accident which is approaching death.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of the virtue of it and according to what signifies to you the dispositions of the patient's virtue, pulse, and goodness.
And accordingly, extract the instrument, and retain the water which is caused by the fact that it is retained by the coden which retains the hole that is on the skin of which you have recounted to you that you should pierce it according to this manner.
And accordingly, repeat the instrument on another day if you find that the patient tolerates it thus, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for some days with caution, and be careful not to err until there is hardly any water left.
But if you fear for the patient and let a great quantity of water flow, then accordingly cure that with burial in hot sand, and cover it with a wet cloth, and wait under the sun for a long time; and cure that with desiccative medicines until he is healed.
And accordingly, cauterize on the stomach, and the melissa and liver in accordance with the extraction of water, just as you have recounted earlier.
Chapter LV.
On the cure of children who are born with unperforated urethral openings.
Sometimes, some of the children are born in this way, that is to say, from their mother's womb and the head of their mixture is not perforated (or has a very narrow opening or is not in its usual place).
Therefore, it is necessary to perform the perforation of it as soon as possible with a spatula made very subtle in this form:
And accordingly, pause the hole with a small leaden clamp and tie it, and let it be for three days or for four.
And when he wants to urinate, be remade and harnessed; and accordingly return that.
And if you do not pause the lead, it is possible that the urine which goes over the place will not let it close.
But he who has a very narrow opening should be treated with a leaden clamp, just as we have said, for many days until it is enlarged.
But those in whom the opening is not in its place are afflicted with this condition, which is because of them, that which is born and grows is at the end of the head of the foreskin so that it cannot urinate downwards, until it lifts up the foreskin with his hand upwards; and it is not a natural generation, for that reason the sperm cannot reach the mother according to rectitude, and it is a morbid condition.
And the manner of operation in this case is that the patient should be placed on his back, and accordingly extend the head of the foreskin with your left hand with a violent extraction, and incise the head of the foreskin at the location of the perineum with a sharp spatula, just as you would cut off some part, so that the middle of it resembles the head of the foreskin and the opening falls into its natural place according to what is necessary.
And be careful that in your operation of bleeding, for many times this happens; and pause at it as long as necessary to stop the bleeding, and cure the wound until it is healed.
Chapter LVI.
On the condition of albugo which occurs in the prepuce at the head of the foreskin and on the corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the foreskin.
Many times this albugo occurs on the foreskin and is an excessive swelling of flesh.
And one of them is malignant, and the other is non-malignant.
Non-malignant, requires that you suspend it with a subtle knife and cut away the excess until it is completely removed; and accordingly pause on that part which has been submerged in Egyptian ointment; and accordingly cure it with that ointment day by day until it is healed.
And if the albugo is malignant, of dark color, then accordingly you must administer cauterization on both sides of the incision and the root of it.
But if the albugo is on the prepuce of the uncircumcised head of the foreskin, and one part of it is inwardly towards the prepuce and the other part is outwardly, then accordingly you must excise the albugo which is inwardly at first until it is consolidated; and then you cure that which is outwardly, for when you cure that together with the prepuce, it is not assured that it will not be torn.
And also it often happens in the genitals and on the prepuce, blackness and corruption; therefore it is necessary to cleanse all that which is already corrupted or which wants to corrupt or has already been corrupted; and accordingly apply a liniment over it with mel, which is mixed with miller's bran and three errors crushed and sifted.
And accordingly cure that with the other remedy until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then accordingly administer lunar cauterization in this form:
for cauterization is helpful at two dispositions together, namely at the flow of blood and at the wound when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the foreskin is corroded and destroyed completely in an instant, then accordingly it is necessary that you introduce into the flesh of the prepuce a leaden cannula so that the patient may urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the foreskin (and this adhesion only occurs in one who has an uncircumcised prepuce, and on whom circumcision is not performed; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess) it is necessary that you excise with an obtuse spatula until the bond is dissolved and the head of the foreskin is completely freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate those parts exactly, then accordingly it is necessary that you excise with a spatula some cause from the head of the foreskin and the prepuce, and thus is why the prepuce, when it is subtle, is pierced through by its own subtlety slightly.
And accordingly separate between the prepuce and the head of the foreskin with a thread of subtle linen, which has been soaked in cold water so that they will not adhere again.
And accordingly be cured with vinegar stipped into it until it is consolidated.
Chapter LVII.
On the purification of children and the cure for those who suffer from circumcision.
Circumcision is not a solution to continuity in the same way as other wounds: but however, since it is our operation and our will, and this applies particularly to children, it is necessary that we assign to them the best possible operation and the easiest path to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not command circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired by experience, which is that you have found that the majority of artists and barbers use circumcising and purifying with a razor and a pair of pincers; and they bind with a cord and incise with the nail.
And you have already prohibited all these methods and did not find better purification with razors, with cord and needle that in purification like the nail, because many times the coden is pushed up too high, since the coden of the prepuce has two tunics, and remains the lowest tunic, and very soon it becomes forced to another incision and certain pain. And the purification made by alphecati, which is digital, used by butchers, is not assured of the incision at the extremity of the male member, because very soon it enters into the tract of it.
But in the operation with a nail, very soon iron and corruption will obstruct your operation. And the foreskin of a child is naturally short, and many times it does not need purification in such a way that there is no necessity for purification, and I have seen this.
But from the purification that is made with razors and cords with needles, I have discovered by experience, that the good, for the razors are of proportional incision, therefore the sharpness that is above is as if it were below; and thus when you press your hand so proportionally to the two sharpnesses, and inscribe accordingly in one time; and it is made a compression of the needle with a figure containing the foreskin of all parts, with which there will be no error at all.
And the manner of the first operation is that you should make the child lie down, as much as those who understand a little, and not do more than to lay the needle in his foreskin just so far, and let it rest until another day.
And accordingly make the child happy in all that manner which is possible to you, according as he receives his intelligence. And accordingly make the child sit between your most steady preparations, and not be at all anxious; and conceal the razors in your hand or leave them under your foot, so that the child does not see those nor any other of the instruments.
And accordingly insert your hand into the foreskin and blow on it, and pull that forward until the head of the foreskin is exposed, and accordingly purify that which has accumulated in it from sores.
The form of the razors for purification, this is the form:
The blades of the razors should be extramitted and not cutting, and the others should be cutting, so that there is no joint between the handle and the blade, and the length of the two sharp edges should be equal to the length of two handles.
But the error in purification is that very soon you will push the foreskin inwardly entirely or partially, and thus make an incision.
Therefore it is necessary that you stretch the foreskin from your hour with your finger before the abscess of the place, and make an incision according to equality.
And if you cannot keep it with your finger, then accordingly extract it with a spatula and make an incision.
But if three days have passed and the foreskin is still swollen from the abscess, then accordingly let it rest until the abscess is cured, and excise that with ease, and make an incision according to what is prepared for you.
And be careful of the head of the foreskin, for it will not come out this way.
And accordingly cure that with the water which has consolidated the powder, the kind of which we have recounted in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised from the foreskin with measure, and obeys to the parts above, then this will not come out.
And accordingly cure that with the water which we have said, until it is healed.
Chapter LVIII.
On the cure of retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction made by pain or blood coagulated, or by a plug or by flesh, and similar to those we have said about the manners of cure in the division.
And if it is not dissolved by what we have said, then the cause of the disease is violent and requires an extraction from the patient with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be made of silver and have a subtle blade, like a bird's beak with subtlety similar to a long finger in the shape of a palm and a half, with a thin thread at its tip.
And the manner of extracting urine with that is as follows: Take a double needle and tie it in the extremity of the tube or canal for good binding; and insert the extremities of the needle into the left side of the syringe, and make an incision with the razors if there is any superfluous cause of the tube, but rather insert it into the canula with vehemence. And accordingly fill the syringe with water.
And make a poultice for the patient on the seat, and envelop the bladder of him and his foreskin with oils of myrrh, olive oil, and egg yolks.
And accordingly insert the syringe with ease until it reaches the root of the foreskin; and accordingly double the foreskin above at the part of the belly; and accordingly push the syringe into that; and accordingly push that until it reaches the bladder, and that will cause the patient to be relieved from the cause of evil, and not made so according to this order, but rather in the manner in which it goes astray.
And accordingly stretch out the thread with the tube little by little, because the urine is swelling the tube.
And accordingly extract that and make a cure of urine, and use the syringe, do not cease to do this and use the syringe until the bladder is evacuated and the patient obtains relief.
Chapter LIX.
On the quality of cathartization of the bladder with a clamp and similar instruments which are suitable for this.
When ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or blood is coagulated in it, or the passage of urine is obstructed, and you wish to distill waters and medicines into that, then accordingly make one with an instrument called a clampcedra, and this is its form:
but in the extremity of it is deaf, or rather closed. And in that there are three holes: two on one side, just as often times.
In the beginning it is a hollow place, in which water is poured, and it should be according to the quantity that fills it, without addition, until when some cause draws out the humors from it, it is drawn, and when it is expelled, with water it is drawn again, and when it is expelled long, just as the clampcedra does, which is filled with naptha in naval battles.
Therefore when you want to draw out humors from the bladder, insert the extremity of the clampcedra into the humidity, and attract with that water which is poured above, because the humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clampcedra.
And accordingly insert the extremity of the clampcedra into the foreskin as we have recounted in the syringe; and accordingly pour in the humidity with water, because that humidity will come to the bladder at once, and the patient will be relieved.
The form of the subtle catheter with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is its form:
And it should be made of silver or lead, the head being similar to a small feather, and having a thread on its end.
And accordingly take the bladder of the patient, and pause in it the humidity you want to catheterize in the bladder, and accordingly tie that between two with a strong knot using a double thread, and heat that humidity over the fire.
And accordingly insert the extremity of the catheter into the foreskin.
And accordingly stretch out your hand over the bladder with the humidity, and descend into it until the patient is relieved, because that humidity has already reached the bladder.
But if the bladder is not present to you, then accordingly take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and pierce that through all its circularity; and accordingly insert a strong thread into those holes, just as they are revolved; and accordingly add the circle in such a way that it is added also to the nature, so that you pause in that which you want of the humors, and oils and waters.
And accordingly tie that to the instrument and make it in such a way as you have made it for the bladder, and express yourself with your hand until the humidity reaches the bladder.
Chapter LX.
On the extraction of pain.
We have already said in the division the species of pain and its cure with medicines, and the difference between pain generated in the lungs and pain generated in the bladder, and the signs of that.
And we have said the pain in which there is operation with hand and section.
And the pain generated in the bladder properly is that which is situated in the bladder.
And you will narrate it with a clear and brief exposition.
Therefore I say that the pain generated in the bladder mainly appears to children; and one of its signs is that the urine which comes out of the bladder is similar to water in its subtlety, and appears in that sand; and the patient often beats their foreskin, and many times they cry out, and accordingly it is dressed; and with this you will see a swelling on the backside of those.
And it is more difficult to heal children from that until they have reached 14 years old; and it is a hard cure in the elderly. But in the young ones, it is easier because they are between those.
And of that which the pain is greater and the cure is more easy; And if it is little, it is contrary to that.
Therefore, when we arrive at the cure of that, it is necessary at first to purify the patient with a catheter which extracts all the crevices that are in their testicles; for that crevice sometimes prevents the entrance of the pain and investigation of that.
And accordingly the patient should be pressed with their own weight and conspired in such a way that the pain descends to the bottom of the bladder, or jumps from one place to another sometimes.
And accordingly make that poultice between your well-prepared hands, and let the things of it be left to themselves, in such a way that the bladder becomes altogether inclined towards the lower parts.
And accordingly apply that poultice and all that is outside.
Therefore, if you feel the pain in space, then accordingly sit down at once with section upon it.
And if you do not feel the pain at all from the above touch, then accordingly it is necessary that you anoint with oil the said indication of your left hand, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if he is a young adult complete, and insert that into their backside. And accordingly for the pain until it stays below the said indication. And accordingly convert that little by little into the neck of the bladder.
And accordingly press upon that with the said finger, and expel that to the outer parts beyond the location where you made the section.
And command the servant to press the bladder with their right hand; and command another servant to extend their left leg up towards the upper parts, and with their other hand to retighten the cord which is below the legs, in the part where the section is being made.
And accordingly insert the spatula which is incident from this: and cut into it what is between the backside and the legs, not in the middle, but before the left hip; and the section should be made on that pain and the said finger should be in the backside, and the section should be transverse, so that the section outside is wide and stretched according to the quantity of the pain that was released, and not more, for fear that the said finger which is in the backside will be overwhelmed by the pain and forgotten.
And know that some pains are to which there is an angle and margin, for which the extraction of it is made difficult.
And of that one, it has a shape like a grain, and is round, and is made for easy extraction.
Therefore, if it is that to which there are angles and margins, adjust it in the crevice.
And if it is not thus forgotten, then accordingly you should press upon that, or strain upon that with decent gestures, the extremity of which should be as a file to which you strain upon the pain, and do not escape from there; or insert below it a subtle instrument with a curved extremity.
But if you cannot press upon that, then accordingly you should widen the hole a little, and if you see a flow of blood, cut off there with strength, using vitriol powdered.
But if the pain is more than one, then accordingly at first you should drive your hand to the mouth of the bladder, and accordingly insert it over there; and accordingly drive in a little bit from that place; and similarly do so for each of the others.
And if the pain is very great, then accordingly ignorance is that you insert it with a large section, for by doing so, you will cause one of two things to happen: either death or the patient's urine will continue to distill in a perpetual manner, because the location is not fully consolidated.
But administer expulsion from there until it is forgotten, or generate in the fracture of that with the razors to extract what remains in pieces.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then accordingly fill the wound with the juice of aloe and blood of dragon, and strengthen it. And pause over that cloth infused with oil and wine, or with roasted oil and cold water, in order that the abscess may be softened.
And accordingly reposition the patient on their back, and do not release the bandage for three days.
And when that is released, wrap the wound with water and a little oil, and accordingly cure it with divine ointment and devil's balsam until it is healed.
But if in the wound there occurs an abscess that is hard and corrosive, and of which it appears as if the blood is congealed in the bladder, and therefore the urine is prohibited (and this is known through the egress of blood with urine), then accordingly insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it will cause the bladder to corrupt and putrefy.
And accordingly wash the wound with wine, vinegar, and salt, and with opposition to all species, with what is needed for the cure until it is healed.
And accordingly in all hours of the cure, you should lie and adjust the medicines that are paused over the wound.
And if the pain is small and is in the meat of the foreskin, and it is seated there, and the flow of urine is prohibited, then accordingly cure that with what I recommended before you come to section, for many times this cure accuses you of section; and now you know this, and you must take a perforator of iron which is like this:
of triangular extremity, sharp, seated in wood.
And accordingly take a thread, and tie it to that with the foreskin below the pain, so that it does not return to the bladder.
And accordingly insert the iron into the foreskin, piercing with facility until the perforator comes to that pain. And accordingly revolve the perforator with your hand in that pain little by little, and you pierce the perforation of it until you make what is on the other side penetrate; for soon the urine will be released.
And accordingly press your hand upon that which is left of the pain from the part outside the foreskin, because it is blocked, and forgotten with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not prepared for you by some cause which prohibits it, then accordingly tie a thread below the pain, and another thread above the pain. And accordingly insert over the pain in that foreskin between two ligatures. And accordingly extract it. And accordingly release the bandage and clean the congealed blood which is in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie the thread below the pain, except that it does not return to the bladder, and the other thread above, only so that when the thread is released near the excision of the pain, the cord returns to its place and closes the wound.
And therefore it is necessary for you when you tie the thread above, that you raise the cord to the upper parts, or that you return to your previous statement, and close the wound just as we have said.
Chapter LXI.
On the extraction of pain from women.
Pain in women is rarely generated.
But if you do feel pain in some of them, then accordingly the cure is difficult and prohibited by many methods.
One of their ways is that the woman is very virtuous.
And the second one is that you do not find a woman who is well-versed in the art of deception, and knows how to pretend to be sick when she wants to deceive a doctor, or is one of those women who are married.
The third one is that you do not find a woman who knows this art, especially the operation with hand.
And the fourth one is that the location of the section on pain in women is distant from the location of the pain, so you need a deep incision, and there is fear.
But if necessity prompts you to do so, then accordingly it is necessary that you take a woman who is well-versed in this art, and not easily frightened.
But if you are deprived of that, then accordingly look for one who is knowledgeable and subtle, or present a matronal woman well-versed in the nature of women, or a woman who has parted from her art.
Therefore present her and command him to do all that you will tell him, from the inquiry on the pain to the beginning; which cause is that he should look if the woman is virtuous, then accordingly put his finger in the backside of her and seek out the pain.
Therefore, if he finds it, cut it below his finger, and then command him to insert over that.
But if she is not virtuous, then accordingly command the matron to insert her finger into the private part of the patient and inquire about the pain, since she puts her left hand on the bladder and presses it with a good pressure.
Therefore, if he finds it, then accordingly gradually press that from the orifice of the bladder to the parts below with the summit of her virtue until she comes to the root of the cleft.
And accordingly insert over that an opposition of the majority of the private part to the root of the cleft, whichever part is paraded and centered in that part, and the said finger is not returned to the pain cut below it.
And the section should be small at first; and accordingly insert the ray over that section, and if you feel the pain, then accordingly adjust the section according to the quantity which you know will cause the pain to be released from that.
And know that the kinds of pain are many: for some are small and great, and sharp and rough, and long and round, and have ridges.
Therefore you know how many kinds there are of it by this which you signify about what you want.
And if you see a flow of blood, adjust the vitriol powder to that location and let it stay there for an hour until the bleeding is stopped, and then return to your operation until the pain is forgotten.
And make sure you prepare with yourself the instruments which I said in the extraction of pain from men, so that you will be helped by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and know that the expulsion of blood is from the instrument that is inserted, then accordingly you should pause powder over the location and strengthen it with powders and strictures descending, and do not iterate this; and leave the pain and do not extract it, for fear that the patient will die soon. And accordingly cure the wound.
And accordingly since the bleeding has ceased after some days, and the location is quiet, then you should return to your operation until the pain is forgotten.
Chapter LXII.
On the section for an abscess in the groin.
Hernia abscess is nothing more than an accumulation of moisture in the white pouch located below the cord of the genitals containing the seed, and is called a pouch.
And sometimes it is in the proper fold of the skin which nature has prepared in the part of the seed, so that it can be contained that it is another seed; and it is the cord of the genitals between the white pouch which we have said, and not there but rather elsewhere.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which occurs in the genitals, for it is poured into these organs this matter; and sometimes it occurs through a blow or injury inflicted on the genitals.
And this moisture has many colors, for the color of it is declining to citrine or sanguine, or red, or black like feces, or white like water, and this is most often.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is located are these: for if it is in the white pouch which we have said, then accordingly the abscess is rounded and declining a little towards length just like the figure of seed, and appears above the genitals, for the moisture contains that from all parts.
And if the moisture is in the proper fold of the skin, then accordingly the abscess is rounded with a part of the seed and so one thinks that it is another seed.
And if the moisture is between the cord of the genitals and the white pouch, then accordingly cut below the sentiment.
And when you want to know the color of the moisture, then accordingly inspect the color of the moisture in the abscess by inserting a probe into its cavity from which the shape is preceded; and according to what is found in the imprint of the probe, judge whether it is there or not.
Therefore when we come to the cure of it with iron, then accordingly it is necessary that you command the patient to be flebotomized if this is possible for you, and sometimes fill his body with blood.
And accordingly be lifted up on the back of your bed over some cause a little above, and pause below it many cloths.
And accordingly sit you on the left side of him, and command the assistant to follow on his right side, which stretches out his arm to one or two sides to the cord of the genitals and the parting of the belly.
And accordingly take a spatula and cut the cord of the genitals from the middle location by its length, almost to the navel.
And accordingly make the incision according to a straight line, equidistant from the line that should be drawn along the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white pouch comprehending.
And cut away that, and observe, and take care not to insert anything; and your cutting away by which it is cut off in one part below as if suspended above the seed more subtly scrutinizes the cutting away according to the quantity that is possible for you.
And accordingly pierce the white pouch full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And accordingly separate between two lips of the section with an incision, and extend the white pouch to the upper parts; and do not touch the cord of the genitals comprehending, and cut away the white pouch in that manner which is possible for you. And cut away that with its entirety or in pieces, and most of all the subtle part below, for if you do not examine carefully the incision of it, there is no secure guarantee that the water will not return.
But if the seed proceeds from that outside of its cord during your operation, then accordingly when you have completed the section of the pouch, return inside it, and accordingly adjust the two lips of the cord of the genitals with a suture, and accordingly cure that just like the other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the seed corrupted by another disease, then accordingly you should ligate the vessels which are sore the suspensories, and extract the seed, and accordingly cure that with what we have said.
But if the water is accumulated in two parts, then accordingly you should know that there are two hernias; therefore cut away that part according to what you have done in the other equally; and if it appears to be one operation, then accordingly you will do it.
And accordingly you should wash away the blood, and put in the sections wool submerged in oil or reddened oil; and pause outside another wool which you have submerged in wine and oil, and spread it over two genitals and the navel; and pause above doubled cloths and powders, and tie those above with a bandage according to this form:
And accordingly there should be pressed two cloths and filled with carminated wool according to this resemblance; and there should be made the extremities with which it is wrapped in cotton or moistened wool, and there should be added with a strap to the girdle of the loincloth, and one of the extremities takes from the backside into the shoulder, and the second takes at the navel side, and two extremities above two clefts below and two other extremities above two angles, and all constriction should be adjusted in the girdle of the loincloth.
And sometimes this hernia is medicated artificially with a cauter in place of an incision with iron; and it is that you take a cauter knife subtle and cut away at that point the cord of the genitals, and then ignite it according to what we have recounted until the white pouch containing the water is revealed, and accordingly you take the cauter in this form: And it is assembled in Greek letters.
And accordingly pierce through that pouch, and ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.
And accordingly extend the pouch with an incision, and cut away with an incision, and cut away with a subtle cauter ignited; and cut away that part according to what is possible for you until it radiates all of it; and take care not to let the seed be touched by the fire.
And know that this operation is more safe and more distant from bleeding, and better than an incision operation.
But if you find opposition or abscess in the hour of incision or cauterization, or bleeding, then accordingly it is necessary that you cure what opposition makes to you by means of the cure which is suitable for him according to what has been said.
But if the patient is afraid and does not expect a second operation due to its horror, then accordingly administer a perforation according to what we have said here; and it is when you are certified by what has been said about the signs that that hernia is watery.
Then accordingly it is necessary that you make the patient sit on some elevated stool, and accordingly pierce the abscess in the lowest part of him with a spatula, and pause the perforation according to the length of his body.
And be the perforation wide enough so that it drains all the water.
And accordingly pause over the place with cotton and tie it up and leave it, so that it drains the remaining water. And accordingly cure that part until the wound is healed.
But if opposition is against the flow of water at that hour, then you should pierce it: and this is not done except because the white fold in the orifice of the wound makes opposition and prohibits the emission of water, therefore it is necessary that you put in the wound a probe or instrument with which the water is extracted from the drops, whose form is preceded; or adjust a small one in the opposite part of the wound.
And know that the water returns, and is accumulated accordingly after 2-3 months or so; and when it is accumulated, then accordingly it should be pierced in this manner, for the patient will thus pass through his days.
Chapter LXIII.
On the section for a fleshy hernia and its cure.
Know that in the section on this hernia, there is fear of being lost to perniciousness in greater dispositions; for which I have seen the dismissal of him and his salvation through better means.
And you are reminded of the operation on this one and the species of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the bodies of those whose genitals are composed and it is done so for many reasons: or due to acute and severe excessiveness, which is poured into the genitals, or due to trauma.
And it is the color of the abscess according to the color of the body, and not found in him pain, and it is a severe abscess.
And it is a very bad abscess, of which the color is dark, and there is no sensation to him.
And sometimes it is done by obstruction of the arteries, and by inflammation of those vessels so that the memory of it is already perceived, or by inflammation of veins.
But this that is due to inflammation of arteries is known by the spread of the abscess when you compress it with those said ties; and it is not necessary for it to touch.
But this that is due to inflammation of veins is not spread from him for any cause by compression with the said ties.
And it is possible that on this species a section should be made and on the other fleshes; and it is that you cut away the cord of the genitals, and accordingly extend the seed to the upper parts, and extract it from the white pouch, and deliver the suspensory vessels, and ligate them, and cut away the suspensory part more than you deliver that of all the part of the seed.
Therefore, if the seed is already consolidated in those fleshes, then accordingly it is necessary that you extract the seed and cut away that part.
And if there is adhesion due to some cause of the pouch or between what is between the vessels, then accordingly it is necessary that you deliver all that adhesion and cut away that part by a round incision.
But if there is native flesh in the location of the adhesion which is behind, then accordingly it is necessary that you cut away all that is from him, and extract the seed just as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is complete, then accordingly fill the wound with wool immersed in reddened oil and wine; and accordingly cure that part with another cure until it is healed.
Chapter LXIV.
On the Cure of a Hernia Caused by Vitis.
Vitis is an abscess wrapped around some kind of wrapping similar to a bud with softening of the testicles, and it makes difficult movements of exercise and walking for the patient.
And in the cure of this disease, it is due to fear caused by what has been previously remembered.
However, I must say that we should perform an operation on that part according to what the first ones did.
And I say that it is necessary to make the patient sit on an elevated stool; and accordingly pull out the suspensory vessels of the testicles down to the lower parts; and accordingly cut away the cord of the genitals with the said ties and veins which are proved by the arm; and hold those other ministers as you, and extend them with vehement extension.
And accordingly cut away with a spatula, broad and flat, by a transverse incision in the right side of the vessels until the vessels are uncovered.
And accordingly cut away all that part, just as we have said in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
And accordingly place an awl in those vessels which has a double thread, and tie that one at the first location where the vit is situated, and tie that other time at the last location of theirs. And accordingly cut away those parts in the middle location by a straight incision according to the length of the body, and extract that which is accumulated with foul and corrupted moisture.
And accordingly cure the wound with a cure for other wounds in which you want to generate health, so that the vessels which do not nourish one of two genitals may be healed, for it is not bad by this.
But if the vit occurs in all the vessels, then accordingly it is necessary that the testicles be extracted or that the testicles through this process become united with the vessels, so that they may be deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and thus become atrophied, or that they become united so that there is no further growth in them.
Chapter LXV.
On the Cure of an Intestinal Hernia.
The advent of this intestinal hernia is due to a section that occurs in the pouch extended over the belly on one side of the navel's angles, so that as a result the intestines burst forth into some of the pouches.
And this rupture is either of the pouch or of excessive fullness, and it occurs in these two species due to many causes: or trauma, or by a blow, or by shouting, or by elevation of some grave cause, or by likeness.
And the sign of this, when it is due to extension of the pouch, is that it occurs gradually over a long period of time, and does not occur suddenly, and it is an abscess growing inwardly toward the precordium because the pouch compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it is when it is due to section of the pouch, because at first it causes a sudden and vehement pain; and it is an abscess different in appearance from that which is apparent by the cord provided with, and this is due to protrusion of the intestine, and the body of it to the lower parts outside the pouch.
And sometimes it is forgotten inside the intestine, and this abscess is called an intestinal hernia or "zirbal".
And sometimes it is made with ventosity, and sometimes it bursts forth in the intestinal fissure, and here it is retained, and this causes great perniciousness for the patient, and sometimes it makes the pain very bad and more severe when it is pressed.
And in the cure of this disease with iron there is fear, because it is necessary to avoid the danger in that place.
And the method of the operation for this is that you command the patient to straighten his intestine with his own hand at the lower parts outside his conquest if he obeys his returnment, and accordingly it should be enveloped over his own back between your thighs, and raise his legs from him.
And accordingly tie the cord which cuts off the cord of the testicles at the upper parts, and cut away the cord of the testicles entirely along its length; and accordingly place it in two lips of the incision, according to what is necessary to widen the incision with those.
And if the section is made according to the quantity that it is possible for you, so that the seed may be forgotten from there.
And accordingly cut away that pouch which is below the cord of the testicles, until the white pouch is revealed from each part.
Then accordingly you will cut away the cord which is between the testicle and the white pouch, which is below the seed, and between the second pouch, and absolve that adhesion which is in the lower part behind the seed.
And accordingly you will take the cord of the testicles with your right hand, and extend the white pouch on its side with your left hand, and lift up the seed along with the pouch to the part of the incision; and command the minister to extend the seed upwards and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind by complete solution.
And search for those ties which ensure that there is no cause of the intestine being enveloped in the white pouch. But if you find any cause from him, then accordingly you will pull it out to the belly below.
And accordingly cut away in the part below the cord of the testicles by a section from which blood and pus flow, just as we have recounted in what we have said.
And accordingly administer wool immersed in oil to the wound; and pause on the wound; and administer the bond which we have recounted (and sometimes the white pouch is cauterized, which we said should be done at the incision of the part because of fear of bleeding, for many times those things happen) and loosen the bond until it falls by itself.
But if the bleeding is delayed, then accordingly cold water should be applied, and pause over it until it falls according to what we have said.
And accordingly cure the wound with another cure for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter LXVI.
On a Ventral Hernia.
In this type of hernia, there is no one who has been bold enough to attempt the cure with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done just as we have recounted in the hernia which is with iron; which is that you tie the vessels close to the section on the other side with facility from there; and accordingly cut away in the middle location around the abscess with water, so that the vessels may fall.
And cure the wound according to what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter LXVII.
On the Disproportion that is done in the Navels.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the navels just as we have said, and protrudes the location.
And there is no cause in the genitals for the intestines to come out; and if there is, it is very rare; and returns back within all hours.
But if the time is prolonged with this, a fissure is formed in the pouch so that the intestine descends into the pouch; and this occurs through the extension of the pouch which is in the navels just as we have said, which cause is that the pouch is stretched, and accordingly it becomes softened and the location becomes abscessed and protrudes.
And the cure for this is with a cauterization just as we have previously described.
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this method: and it is that the patient lies on his back between his thighs, and accordingly cuts away the location of the rupture of the abscesses protruding by a section in the direction of the width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
And accordingly strengthen the white pouch which is below the cord until it is revealed.
And accordingly take the ray and pause it over the protruding location of the pouch, and press it against the belly's navel.
And accordingly cut the two protruding locations on the extremity of the ray of the pouch, and tie them together with a suture one to the other.
And accordingly extract the extremity of the ray, and do not cut away the entire pouch, nor extend the seed, nor any other cause just as you should know in the cure of an intestinal hernia.
And accordingly cure that with the cure of wounds, and when you cut away the threads, purify that and restore the wound until it is consolidated; for the pouch has contracted and the protrusion of rupture is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this location, for it is more conducive to health.
Chapter LXVIII.
On the Softening of the Cord of the Testicles.
Many times the cord of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh that is between it is softened, and it becomes suitable for examination.
Therefore it is necessary for the one who is conducting the cure to make the patient lie on his back between his thighs, and cut away all the softened cord which is above the natural cord; and accordingly tie two lips with a suture.
And if you wish, cut away in the beginning the surplus of the softened cord with three or four cauterizations and a firm suture.
And accordingly cut away between the sutures; and accordingly cure by curing other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall.
Chapter LXIX.
On Castration.
Know that castration in our law is excommunicated, but for a reason it is written to me so that I remember of it in this book; and it is not necessary to recall it except by two methods, one of which is because it is in the science of the doctor when he is asked about it, knowing the cure for what happens; and the other method is because we have often needed castration of other beasts for our livestock through those animals, such as horses, oxen, pigs, and similar to animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: or by cauterization, or by incision with a section.
But in that which is done by cauterization, the way of the operation is that we make the animal lie down in cold water until its genitals are softened and relaxed, and hang loose. And accordingly take those with your right hand so that they are resolved and do not appear to be left behind the touch.
But in castration done by incision and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the cord of the testicles with your left hand.
And accordingly tie the suspensory ligaments, and cut away on each testicle with one section until two testicles process.
And accordingly cut away those more than what you have previously excised. And do not leave any cause on the pouch, except for the subtle pouch which is above the vessels.
And this method of castration is better which is done by cauterization, for cauterization strongly leaves no cause of the testicles so that the animal desires to copulate.
And accordingly cure the wound until it is healed.
Chapter LXX.
On the Cure of Hermaphrodism.
Hermaphrodism in men is according to two ways: one way is when a figure appears in that space which is between the cords of the testicles, where it is as if a female figure were in place of a male one.
And sometimes from that there occurs a flow of urine which is in the cord of the testicles.
But in women, it is one species: and it is that the female pudendum on the pubis is just as two male testicles are united in a small portion, like the periurethral glands of a man and two testicles.
And the cure is of three species: one of men and two of women. And it is that you should cut away those adjusted flesh parts until the impression of that is gone, and accordingly cure those with the cure of other wounds.
And in the second species of men from which urine flows which is in the cord of the testicles, there is no cure or operation for that.
Chapter XXI.
On Lumps and Fleshy Growth due to Causes of Women.
Lumpiness is strongly adjusted on natural causes until it is exhausted and a firm inspection is made; and sometimes it is magnified in certain women to such an extent that it spreads like in men and prevails even up to the act of copulation.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to take away the excess lumpiness with your right hand or a probe and cut it away.
And do not stop cutting until you reach the root of the lumpiness, for fear that bleeding may ensue.
And accordingly cure that with the cure of wounds until it is healed.
But flesh born is flesh that grows in the horrific belly of the mare until it fills that place, and strongly emerges at the foreparts resembling a horn (and for this reason some people first call this "malautia caudata"); therefore, it is necessary for us to cut away just as we cut away lumpiness, and cure that until it is healed.
Chapter LXXII.
On the Cure of Ulceration.
Ulceration is when the female pudendum is not perforated or only slightly pierced. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to disease that has preceded, and it is caused either by flesh not well adjusted or by subtle pouch or thick one.
And it is caused either in the belly of the mare, or in the sides of it, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it, and prohibits copulation, pregnancy, and childbirth, and strongly prohibits menstruation.
And the diagnosis of that is made by inspection of the meter, if the opacity is apparent, it is revealed; but if it is not apparent, then you should search for it with the said fingers or with a probe.
But if the opacity is due to subtle pouch and it is revealed in both lips, then you should cut and dissect that.
And accordingly pause on the two lips of the pulp, and pause those said fingers which indicate both masses together.
And the woman should lie on her back, her legs extended, and accordingly stretch out both lips with force until that subtle pouch is broken and the opacity is opened.
And accordingly take wool and wet it in oil and pause it on the location, and lie with a man for one day so that the location may not be consolidated.
But if the pouch is large and thick, then it is necessary for you to cut away that with a spatula or with a leaf of myrtle.
But if the opacity is due to fleshiness, then suspend that with a probe and cut away that.
And use with you the medicines that stop bleeding without scratching, such as hellebore, blood of dragon, and essences, adjusted with white of egg.
And accordingly administer a leaden cannula wide enough so that the wound may not be consolidated quickly.
And hold that for several days and administer lukewarm water.
And accordingly be cured with the other cure of consolidation until it is healed.
And sometimes accidents occur in the natural birth of other flesh, and accordingly it is necessary to cut away according to this method. But if it is due to gangrenous abscesses, then there should be no contraindication with iron in any method.
Chapter LXXIII.
On the Cure of Hemorrhoids, Tail, and Red Botox that occurs in the female pudendum.
Hemorrhoids are a great trouble of the outlets of many veins until those vessels flow continuously with blood; and when old hemorrhoids and their tholes are formed.
And I have said in the division of those species and their signs, that I will also say which ones receive cure and which ones do not receive cure.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and their tholes when they are in the belly of the mare and do not appear to the sense, then there should be no cure made with iron.
But those that are in the outlet of the mare and on which one senses something, are those that can be cured.
And it is necessary to put the woman in a warm bath and accordingly stretch her thighs with forceps or with rough cloth, and cut away those with razors.
And accordingly powder is to be sprinkled on those areas with the flow of blood from one of the non-scratching powders, such as cassia and similar to those.
And accordingly apply ice to her feet for an hour, and accordingly pause that in cold water.
And if the bleeding persists, then make that woman drink a decoction of Sumatra and scorched millet, and gualas and similar to those.
And accordingly take wheat flour and mix that with honey, vinegar, and make a poultice with water on the back of her.
And if the blood is absorbed, it is well; and otherwise, make adhere two bandages, and to the nipples without scarification.
And accordingly take wool and submerge that in the juice of colinander, or in the juice of arnoglossum, or in the juice of guarravier with vinegar and make adhere to the location; and accordingly cure that location with ointment until it is healed.
And cure that until it is healed.
Chapter LXXIV.
On the Perforation of Accidental Eversion in the Mare.
Many species of accidental abscesses occur in the mare, such as gangrenous and lapidinous abscesses, ulcers, adhubelation, herpes, eruptions, hemorrhoids, and other abscesses. And I have already said these diseases, their species and signs, and their cures in the division.
And it is necessary for you to say in this treatise on cauterized abscess which occurs in the mare when it comes from the abscesses that are conducive to health, and if you wish to know in what way the operation is done with iron.
Therefore it is necessary for you to consider if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is acute with percussion and inflammation and fever, and sometimes that abscess inflames and if you sense something over it, then do not cut away with perforation, but cure that with water that helps on maturation until the acuteness of the accident ceases.
And accordingly it is necessary for you to make the woman lie on a couch that has two cushions; and recline over her back and adjust her feet at the part most distant from the belly, and her thighs be expanded, and pause her arms below her nails, and bind each one with a ligament adapted to water.
And accordingly the matron should follow the right side and administer the instrument with which the outlet of the mare is opened, in the form that will be described in those causes which will be made accordingly.
And accordingly when you wish to administer this instrument, make it in the ray of the belly of the mare of the woman, and that part of the instrument which enters the mare is not more than the belly of the mare and leads the patient. But if the instrument is greater than the belly of the mare, then it is necessary for you to pause powder on the texture of the belly of the mare so that it is prohibited for any instrument to enter the belly of the mare.
And accordingly it is necessary for you to pause the valve that runs in the instrument on the right side above and the minister should hold the instrument and turn the valve until the outlet of the mare is opened.
And when the excitement appears, and it is touched by hand and is hot and moist, then it is necessary for you to cut away that which covers the head with a spatula.
And when the discharge is evacuated, then it is necessary for you to pause in the wound a sponge immersed in red oil or green oil which has some styptic quality; and pause the clamp in the section of the belly of the mare.
And pause outside the mare, and on the pentenary wool, a clean sponge immersed in water in which violet flowers are washed.
And accordingly be cured in two days with ointment that is suitable for water until it is healed.
And sometimes the mare and the wound are washed in this way that is clarified with water and honey, and accordingly with water in which roots of lily or aristolochia longa have been washed, and accordingly returns to ointment.
And if the wound is deep in the mare, then it is necessary for you to be prohibited from curing that with iron, having cured that with water as we have said in the division.
Chapter LXXV.
To teach midwives how to medicate living beings when they appear according to non-natural figure.
A necessary cause is that the midwife should know at the beginning the figure of natural childbirth by signs from it, and that when you see the woman expel at the parts behind and desires to smell the air, and above that she is relieved by what is over her part, and hasten the extraction of the fetus, then you will know that this part is according to natural figure, and it is the extraction of it on its head, and the second one hanging with that or suspended from the umbilicus.
Therefore, when you see those signs, it is necessary for the belly of it to be compressed so that the fetus descends slightly because when they descend on its head, they give birth to it, and it is cleaned of those superfluities with good cleansing.
But that which is another part is non-natural and not acceptable, because when the fetus is extracted over its feet and the body of it is extracted before its head and its feet, and one hand at its foot ..., or it is extracted the head of it and one hand at its foot, or at the belly of it, and very strongly turned over its neck, and resembling the figures of it non-natural.
Therefore, a necessary cause is that the midwife should be wise and subtle in all those causes, and that she guard against error and deception.
And you show all the figures of those, and what nature is in them so that it may be signified by this and stood upon this.
When the child is born over its head by natural excitement, and it is vehement upon the woman and makes a difficult part, and sometimes the virtue of the woman is already debilitated, then make that woman drink or have that drink, and evaporate the pudendum with fenugreek and hot oil.
And accordingly introduce the midwife between her said small spatula and the fissure with that second one, or cut away that with her own nail until it runs with that which is in her of humidity. And press the belly of the woman until she gives birth to the child.
But if it does not give birth, then it is necessary for the woman to be clarified with a poultice of pellitory and a poultice of fenugreek with chamomile.
And accordingly command it to be pressed and make that woman sneeze with conditions; and take the mouth of it and the nose of it for one hour, because the child will soon forget.
And if the two breasts of the child are forgotten at the beginning, then it is necessary for you to reduce those with small ease. But if it does not obey the instrument, then it is necessary to pause the woman on a couch and lift her feet up, and accordingly conceive the couch over the earth; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the concussion.
And if the breasts are not returned and the child dies, then it is necessary to cut away those and extract the remainder of the child or bind its body to the hand with cloth and extract that with equality, because that will soon be forgotten.
When the child is extracted from its feet, then it is necessary for you to impel them in, and accordingly turn that child small, and accordingly that which equals that, and accordingly take one foot of it and extend those small by small.
But when they are extracted into the thighs, then it is necessary for you to command it to be expelled, and make that one exhale with conditions, because it will soon be forgotten if God so wills.
And if it is not forgotten with what we have recounted, then you return the child small by small until that one pauses according to natural figure, because that will soon be forgotten with easier extraction.
And if it is prohibited from all that we have recounted, then take a poultice of althea and dissolved gum, and beat all in the mortar with good beating, and accordingly line up with water the pudendum of the woman, at the lowest part of her belly. And accordingly make that one cease in hot water, until it reaches the hypochondria.
And when the parts behind of it are relaxed, then make for it a sub-fumigation of myrtle and sub-pause that on it. And when the sub-fumigation is done for an hour, then make that one cease on a couch, and accordingly make it sneeze and stretch its mouth, and take away from that, and press the lowest part of the belly of it with gentle compression, so that the child will soon be forgotten.
Extraction of the Child Laterally Hanging from One of Its Breasts. Let it be introduced in reduction of the hand of it, but if you cannot reduce that one, then raise the woman and make her go.
And if she cannot go, then make her lie down on the light, and conceive the thighs of it with violent concussion, and accordingly administer those remedies which you have and recounted of poultices.
And if the childbirth is come, then make that woman cease on a couch, and accordingly study on the reduction of the hand, and equalize the child according to natural figure, and make the woman sneeze and command it to compress itself until it is forgotten.
Extraction of the Child over the Neck, with expanded breasts and the flesh of it at the two sides of its right arm. It is necessary for the midwife to hold the hand of the child and accordingly turn it little by little, and make it equal with facility.
And when it is equalized, and then pause on the pudendum of it with that which we have recounted of oil and poultices.
And accordingly command it to be mauled little by little, and when you have done that, then make that one cease on a couch and command it to be inclined over the right side, and accordingly command it to be compressed; and make that one sneeze with conditions. Extraction of the Prepared Fetus from the Right Side.
When it is necessary to cut away the second one from the right side according to this manner, consider, and accordingly you should cut away that with your own nail until it is evacuated of humidity.
And if the child is suspended over the face and neck of it, then you should cut away that from the umbilical cord, in order that it may not be retained and die.
And accordingly push the child into the parts behind until it is paused according to what is necessary, and command the woman to compress herself at times, and if God so wills, it will soon be forgotten with easier extraction.
Extraction of Twins or Multiple Fetus. Know that sometimes twins are born, and occasionally three or four, but this is strange and does not always happen. But there are causes that are natural and do not live.
And know that these [twins or multiple fetus] are separated by cleft, distinguishing each from the umbilical cord of each of them. And sometimes they are forgotten like one child for easier extraction natural, and some times they are extracted non-naturally as we have recounted.
And if they are difficult to deliver or any of them, then cure those as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is subtle and does that which facilitates ease and subtlety, and in delay, and is introduced according to all figure as it is prepared with art leading to salvation.
Recollection of what forms in the womb from embryos and is Aborted.
Some women are formed in the womb with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and up to ten children, and it is verified that a woman can abort after giving birth to six or ten children, which causes wonder because of the measurement of the wise sages.
And all this is necessary for the science of the midwife, because very strongly it resembles that, and thus pause there at that with what is necessary.
Chapter LXXVI.
On the Extraction of the Fetus when Dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medicine and it is not outside extracted, and you are forced to use operation with hand, then it is necessary for you to consider whether the woman has sound virtue and is not afflicted by any of the accidents for which over her is feared destruction.
Then it is necessary for the woman to be elevated on a couch on her back, and for her head to be inclined downwards and her thighs to be raised.
And the minister should hold that in two parts or tie it to the couch so that the body of her does not extend beyond the extraction of the fetus.
And accordingly you should moisten the mouth of the woman with hot oil and poultice of althea and fenugreek and seed of lily.
And accordingly the midwife should introduce her hand with those oils and poultices into the womb, and accordingly enter her hand with ease in the woman, and accordingly seek out the exact location where the fingers will be placed on the fetus.
And when the location is convenient: then you should consider if the fetus is prepared to descend onto its head, and accordingly place your fingers in the eyes, or on the neck, or in the mouth, or on the palate, or below the beard, or in the furcula of it, or in the places proper to the sides, or below the hypochondria.
But if the descent is onto the feet of it, then in the navel or in the middle of the sides.
And it is necessary to have the fingers of the right hand, and pause the curvature of it in that location which is between the digits of the left hand, and introduce the hand with ease and place the fingers in one of those locations which we have said, until you reach the cause of the boy.
And accordingly pause and stay in the application of it another finger or the third if necessary, to cause attraction equalization, and not be extended according to its straightness only.
And thus it will be good at all parts, to the point that the extraction of it will be alleviated in this way, as is done with a tooth for the eradication of it.
And it is necessary for that which is between them to be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil and introduce those expertly and turn them with what is retained.
Then if the part of the fetus is forgotten, then let the fingers be permeated into that location which is higher up; and make so until the entire fetus is forgotten.
But if the hand is stuck in front of the other and it is not possible to reduce that one by the contraction of it, then let a cloth be wrapped around that one; and accordingly extract that until all is forgotten, and cut away at the joint of the hand or in the wrist.
And thus it is necessary to do so with the other hand and both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or an accident occurs during extraction, or there is water adjusted in the head of it, then it is necessary to introduce between the fingers a spatula with spines and cut the head and extract the water, or that which discloses that one by an instrument called "alundat", the form of which will come from the forms of other instruments in the chapter which is adjacent to this.
And similarly do if the fetus is of large head by nature: and then it is necessary to cut away that one with an instrument called "algematu", or take that one with an instrument called "alundat" as we have said; and accordingly extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is extracted and constricted at the furcula, then it should be cut open until the humidity which is in the feet is poured out.
But if it is not complicated, nor obedient to extraction, then you should cut away the head soon as possible according to what seems best to you.
And if the remains of the womb are apostemated or are in water retention, then it is necessary for you to perforate that one until the humidity which is in it runs out.
But if the fetus is on its feet, then the attraction of it is light and the direction of it to the mouth of the womb is light.
But if it is constricted at the belly and feet, then it is necessary for you to extract that one with a cloth which you will wrap around your hand, and to cut open the belly and feet until the water which is in those flows out.
But if the other limbs are left and turn back to the head, then place it into the left hand; but if the mouth of the womb is blocked, then introduce the right hand into the prepuce of the layre, and seek out that head, and draw it with those fingers into the mouth of the womb, and accordingly introduce one finger or two fingers, and draw it with those.
And if the mouth of the womb is constricted due to apostema which occurs in it, then it is necessary not to trouble with it; beforehand it is necessary to administer an effusion of moist and fatty causes. And administer poultices; and follow the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if possible, it should be punctured: and the same treatment as we have said for a living fetus.
And if this is not possible, then it should be cut away in pieces, and extracted.
And it is necessary that no cause is left behind the second one.
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer what we have said about the treatment of apostemas which occur in the womb.
And if a flow of blood occurs, then apply to it water that is astringent and administer the other treatment.
And I myself have seen a woman in the womb of whom was a dead fetus, and accordingly upon that same fire another pregnancy had been taken up, and accordingly dead is the other fetus. It happened to me that after a long time an apostema formed in my navel; it swelled up until it became a festering boil, and then I began to shed blood.
And I was called to the cure of it, and medicated it for a long time, but the wound did not consolidate.
Then I applied to it some poultices of strong attraction, and extracted from it a bone, and accordingly passed some days, and extracted another bone; and I was extremely astonished, since in the womb there is no bone.
And then I thought that they were the bones of the dead fetus.
Then I cleaned the wound and extracted from it many bones, the woman existing in her own circumstances, and already living in such a manner for a long time, correcting of herself a small amount of blood.
And I did not find it strange, but rather because in this is science and aid to what the physician artificer administers with his hand for treatment.
On the forms of instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of vertex which is opened the womb:
This is the form of strengthener in which are equalized the free ones, to which equalization there are two vertexes at two extremities of two feet. But however this vertex must be more subtle than the stricter one, and made of ebony or of boxwood.
And the latitude of each piece is as much as two fingers and the margin of each piece is one finger on each side; and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle place between the two pieces are two adjustments of those same pieces which are already fixed, the length of which is half a palm more, and the latitude of each is as much as two fingers, or a little more.
And these two adjustments are introduced into the mouth of the womb so that it is opened to receive them when you revolve the two prescribed vertexes.
Another similar form, yet more subtle and lighter:
It is made of ebony or boxwood according to the shape of forceps. But however in the extremity of it there are two additions like times, and the length of those additions is as much as a palm, and the latitude of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the womb with those, then you should cause the woman to lean slightly over the couch, with her feet hanging down, opening that which is between the thighs of her. And accordingly place your hand on the instrument as you do with forceps, equalizing it according to the quantity that you want of the appreciation of the mouth of the womb until she does what you want.
The form of vertex which the ancients called:
Form of impeller with which the fetus is pushed:
Form of amputation with which the large head is cut off.
And it is assembled to forceps with which are teeth on the extremity, like times, and some times it is made long like forceps according to this form, like times, with which are teeth like the teeth of a saw, with which it is cut and severed. Form of amputation few:
Form of fingers having a spine:
Form of fingers having two spines:
Form of spatula having two extremities with which the head is cut off.
Form of two spatulas laid:
All those instruments are exercised, and when more numerous the species of that one and prepared by artificers, as much as is easier to their operation and more perfect for men according to their quantity.
And you must not neglect those instruments, whatever they may be, because the necessity of them is inexcusable.
On the extraction of the placenta.
When the placenta is retained after childbirth, then you must command the patient to retain her breath, and accordingly make that one cough with condiments, and strengthen your hand over the mouth and nostrils of it, and if by this means it is expelled, so be it.
And if not, then you take a cloth and perforate it in the cover of one track and pause in that herb which burns the mouth of the womb, as with calamus, rue, anise, camomile, Arabic senna, and cassia lignea, and St. John's Wort. All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water in the cloth, and then pause that one over the fire.
And accordingly place a reed cane in the mouth of the womb, and hold that one until the vapor comes to the concavity of the womb.
And accordingly make that one cough as we have said, and the placenta is expelled with rapidity.
But if this cure does not succeed and the placenta is still retained, then you command the midwife to immerse her left hand in samian oil or in a poultice of althea, and accordingly introduce that into the cavity and seek out the placenta, and when you have found it, then take it and draw it out gradually Little by little. But if it is annexed in the prepuce of the womb, then introduce your hand as we have recounted, and when you have found the placenta, extract it slowly and carefully so that the womb does not collapse due to excessive attraction. Beforehand it is necessary that it be permeated on both right and left sides with ease.
And if the mouth of the womb is constricted, we have already recounted the cure by coughing and by medication with a cloth and herbs.
But if it is not expelled with all the causes which we have recounted, then beware that you do not force it on her in iteration of abstraction, but rather it should be what has come out from it to the mouth of the womb lie at the thigh of the woman, and accordingly cover it with a cloth and tetrapharmacum; for that will cause it to rot away gradually over some days and will be dissolved and expelled.
But when it has rotted away, it will be elevated to bad odor at the head and stomach, and thus lead the patient astray; and therefore it is necessary that sub-fumigations and conveniences are administered to it.
But some of the Ancients already knew how to concoct a sub-fumigation from Nazareth and dried figs.
Form of instrument with which the woman is sub-fumigated for the retention of menstruation and placenta:
It is made of ivory or horn.
And it is paused with the subtle extremity in the cavity and the broad extremity over the fire, and the sub-fumigation is paused above the arms of the fire.
And hold that one in until the sub-fumigation is consumed and iterate again.
On the cure of the child's uncircumcised anus.
Many children are born without foreskin and their anuses are not pierced, those which already have a subtle and opaque covering. Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to pierce with her finger that covering; and if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula, and beware that she does not touch the lacet.
And accordingly place on that one cloth saturated in vinegar and oil; and accordingly cure that with a poultice until it is sealed.
But if you fear that it is hardened, then pause in the track a reed cane for many days, and stop when the child wants to relieve itself.
And already occurs obstruction of the anus due to consolidation of wound or apostema; therefore it is necessary that this consolidation be cut away, and accordingly cured with the water which we have said for cure and with lead.
On the cure of the fistulas that remain after childbirth.
The fistulas which remain after childbirth, being lower down near the navel and larger ones which are situated almost in front of or on one side of the anus.
And it is a single fistula or multiple ones.
And when that nodulation is aged and flows with white or subtle pus, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those that are penetrating are known by what comes out of them through the discharge and windiness; and sometimes they use the patient's discharge, and very little is emitted from them vermin-like.
And some of these fistulas occasionally penetrate into the bladder and into the urethra of the penis; and some penetrate into the junction of the thigh and into the node of the vulva.
And the way to know if a fistula is penetrating into the anus and not-penetrating is that you insert your finger into the anus, and introduce a subtle probe of horn or iron into the fistula when there is no obturation.
But if there is obturation in that one, then introduce into it a subtle probe of lead or cowhide until you feel the probe or hide on your finger.
And if you do not feel that one at all or there is no process of the track any cause of discharge, worm, or windiness, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and accordingly apply yourself to the cure.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or into the urethra of the penis, then know that its significance is the emission of urine from it and prohibition of it to this place where the medicine will be consolidated.
But if it is penetrating into the junction of the thigh or into the bone and causing pain in the circuit, then know that its signification is that the probe will go in here if there is no obturation in the bone, and causing pain in the circuit of the part; and that from it yeasty pus always comes out; and that this medicine does not take hold nor is consolidated with a poultice.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure, and the cure of these is tedious and vain work by the foolish physicians on which we have fixed our attention.
But in that one which is not penetrating and not aged, the cure with iron is expected according to what you have recounted and proved.
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on both sides and raises his legs up to you, his thighs being inclined towards his belly, and accordingly introduce a probe of lead or horn if there is obturation in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe will go in.
And if that one feels the patient around the navel, then it is necessary for you to insert your finger into the navel.
And if you feel the probe already partially exposed to penetrate, or that which you feel between your finger and the siphac or flesh, then know certainly that it is penetrating; and therefore do not work on it, as we have said.
But however some may say that it is cured in some men truly.
And the medicine by which it is expected to be relieved in that one is that you apply a subtle cauterizing fire according to the size of the fistula, as previously described, and introduce that ignited fire into the fistula until it spreads around the navel; and accordingly repeat that two or three times until you know that all those adjusted fleshy parts are fitted together like a quill of an owl.
And accordingly cure that one with callosities wrapped in parchment until all those fleshy parts that are adjusted are covered, and accordingly cure that one with medicines generating and consolidating flesh, and if it is healed, good is; and if not, then it will never be cured by any other treatment.
And if the probe goes in and does not penetrate into that which is in the anus, but between that and the probe which is a thin layer of flesh or skin, and the fistula opens up as if it were cutting through the surface of the cord, then dry out the cord from the beginning of the fistula, and you see it drying with the probe, and it will be in the fistula until the drying reaches the location where the extremity of the probe goes in, and by the probe is liberated and cut.
And accordingly purify those fleshy parts that are fitted together like a reed of an owl and do not remain any cause.
But if a flow of blood occurs when you intervene with your operation to purify those fleshy parts, then use the instrument that is most suitable and of the least painful kind, namely cauterization with fire or acute medicine, for cauterization with fire adjusts two good habits: one is the adjustment of those adjusted fleshy parts, and the other is the ablation of blood by excess of moisture.
And accordingly cure that one with callosities wrapped in parchment or in threefold cause until the location gets braided, and accordingly cure the wound with hard flesh engendered and consolidated.
And such medicines which have astringency and excess; when they are restored, it is already healed and you do not fear relapse.
But if the fistula has opened up into the perineum of the anus and is prolonged from its surface to the body, then insert your finger into the anus and investigate that.
And therefore if you find the probe and it is between you and her a thin layer of skin or flesh, and it is prepared for penetration, then there will be no operation in that place except according to the way of faith and hope.
The cause is to administer in that place one of three methods: either to cauterize it as we have said; or to dry it out until you achieve the conquest of it so that it becomes possible for you to insert the probe and apply the cure provided; and do not process anything else except for the drying, so that you do not introduce the lacet containing the navel, and that you happen upon the patient's will through the emission of urine; and accordingly cure that one with what we have said, for it is very likely to be healed; or to stretch out that thin layer and cleanse that pus that dries out inside the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or another instrument with an acute extremity, and accordingly cleanse those fleshy parts fistulated which are in the section until you can apply percrustation; and accordingly strive to make the restoration of the entire wound by drying it out, and if the opening above is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open on the side of the anus, and becomes even more likely for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is ended in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the edge of the anus around the surface of the body with the cord and on the margin of the anus, then take hold of the perforated extremity, which is like an awl prepared to pierce through according to this form:
and insert into that faithful one wrapped in five faiths or around those; and accordingly insert the probe with faith into the fistula until you achieve the conquest of it.
But if it is penetrating in the margin of the anus, then you extract the thread from that track just as you insert your finger into the anus; and pull out the extremity of the thread and adjust the two ends together, and strengthen each one, and let it rest for a day or for two, and when more you insert the thread into the flesh, strengthen it well so that those fleshy parts which are between the two ends of the thread and fall off.
And accordingly cure the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in whatever way you are prepared, but not in the perineum, for it is not to your advantage to do so that you may not introduce the lacet; and accordingly make it heal as soon as possible.
The shape of the spatula with which the fistula is opened up: its curvature is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not introduce anything that is not necessary, just as one would.
On the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows during the insertion of those.
Hemorrhoids are according to two ways, for either they are between the anus resembling as if they were of charcoal, or else those are like a bunch of grapes. And those are small and large, and the blood flows from them at all times and is one, and many, and outside the anus, and in its extremities.
But however those that are outside the anus are according to the months of little humidity, from which yellowish water or a small amount of blood with continuous flow, and according to the color of the body.
And the cure for that which is outside the anus is to command the patient to sit down and to evacuate himself until the anus opens and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you take hold and suspend them with your fingers or what you have with your nail, and accordingly cut off the roots of those hemorrhoids.
But if the fingers are not grasped by those due to their moisture and softening of them, then take them with a rough cloth or with a piece of wool or with a flaxen thread, and pull out those hemorrhoids with your finger, and accordingly cut off those hemorrhoids and powderize some powders over them near the insertion, so that they are applied to those places in place of cauterization; or cauterize those according to what is preceded in the chapter on cauterizing. And accordingly cure those with the other cure until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey evacuation, then anoint the patient with a chrism in which there is a small biting, and wash it with that water that is in the anus and that will obey evacuation slightly when the patient evacuates.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause of them is light, and it is that you take those with your finger, or that you take those with a probe, and insert those, and accordingly cure those with water as we have said until they are healed.
And the one who will perform the suturing, must administer it in this way: take a thread wrapped and insert that into an awl and accordingly pull out the hemorrhoids to the upper parts, and make that penetrate with the awl in the root of the other part, and wrap around the two ends of the thread in the lower part, and so laterally; and strengthen the hemorrhoid with a strong stitch, and accordingly cut off the thread and pull out the awl.
And do this to all of them, and leave one open and not close it, so that the superfluity of blood may flow from that one.
And accordingly place a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerote on the anus, and place that on the anus and command the patient to rest. And accordingly leave it until it heals; and when it is healed, cure those with anointing or with another cure until they are well.
And since they are old and not suitable for that medicine, then you must take those with the point of a spatula or with your finger until they become wet and are held by the scab above, which prevents them from consolidating; and accordingly cure those until they are consolidated.
Then you must take those with reason more violent than the first one until much blood flows and they are excoriated; and accordingly cure those until they are healed.
Know that Almesamer, this is the key, and it's not just a notion based on the color of the body resembling a clavicle, but rather it's made throughout the entire body and particularly in the parts below the shoulders and above the knees, and there are signs for those pains that demand anointing.
And then it's necessary that what is in the circuit of the key be cut out, and be held by the pincers or probes, and be eradicated from its root; and accordingly cure that one.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is preceded in the chapter on cauterizing.
But of warty growth is a small, rough, round fistula-like excrescence on the surface of the body, and many times it appears in children.
And the cure for this is to stretch and incise that, or to strengthen it with a thread or skin until it closes. And if you wish, cauterize it according to what we have said, with fire or acute medicine.
But of fungal growth is a small, fatty or fistula-like excrescence on the surface of the body which often appears in the groin area; and when the heat finds that, it is set in motion like a bite from a fungus, and it becomes wrapped around the body.
And the cure for this is to take a reed cane or a reed tube, and it must be strong, and place that on the fungus until it contains the circle of the reed cane around its parts; and accordingly revolve your hand with the reed cane until you incise what is in the circuit of the fungus, and place that in the fold of the flesh, and then eradicate the fungus from its root.
And if you wish, do it with an iron or steel reed according to this form:
Be the upper part of the reed thin and subtle, not perforated (so it is not pierced), wrapped around so that on the said surface the beginning of it is ablated and the revolution of that one is turned.
And if you wish, cauterize the fungus according to what is said earlier in the chapter on cauterizing in the book of Aethel.
On the Form of Instruments That Are Administered to Give Chrism.
Sometimes it is made chrism of silver or lead or melted iron or hammered; and sometimes it is made from small and large instruments according to those which are administered, for that which is administered in the cure of small children should be small; and for those whose anuses are tender or painful, the chrisms of those should be small.
The Form of Great Chrism and Little.
The head of the reed cane above, in which the pouch is tied, should be wide according to this manner; and there should be distinction at the point where the pouch is tied just like many times.
And the extremity of it below, which is inserted into the anus, should be thick (so it is not open) like a lion's mane, going back to subtlety; and on one side of it there are two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays and slightly thicker in the middle.
And the pouch should contain the medicines of animal gall or sheep's skin, and the root of it should be one palm.
And it should be pierced by many holes just like it is rolled up; and if the space between the holes is as thick as the said one.
And accordingly insert into those holes a strong thread of raw thread which is of ten threads, or surround them; and adjust the pouch on it; and when the pouch is placed in that position, be tight in the head of the chrism between two distinguished parts with a strong constriction, and accordingly cauterize each hole: But the quality of cauterizing that is to fill the pouch with medicine, which should be heated according to the quantity of the tolerance of the patient; and beware that it is not too hot nor too cold.
And accordingly the patient should be laid on his back, and raise his legs up and place one of them under the other, leaving one corner above which the men or lances are placed; and accordingly bring a piece of the cauter to the anus with oil or albumen of hen or mucilage of fenugreek or similar substances; and accordingly insert that into the anus with ease, and accordingly the minister should take the pouch and evacuate all that is in the chrism into the bedpan; and accordingly extract the chrism and the patient will lift his legs to the wall.
And if the medicine forces him to evacuate, keep it as long as it can; and if he sleeps with that for a whole night, it is more likely to be effective.
But if you cauterize that in cases of diarrhea and the evacuation of stool is excessive, then you must repeat the cauterization until it is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or abscesses in the anus, then use a chrism that is very subtle and thick, like the chrisms with which children are circumcised.
On the Cure of Plagues.
And I have already said in the division of the cure of plagues that which is suitable for a free person, and I say thus the cure of those with me and with medicines according to the complement.
Therefore I say that plagues are diversified according to how they are made and according to the location on which they appear.
And the causes by which many times plagues are made are just like those of pepper, or incision with a knife or sword, or percussion with a hammer, or with a rod, or with an arrow, or similar to those of many causes.
But the plagues that are in the locations of the body are just like plague which caters on the head, or on the neck, or on the feet, or on the belly, or on the thigh, and similar to those of the members.
And I am recommending the cure for some plagues, so that you can pause and reason about those others.
And I shall begin with the simple plagues of the head, for the memory of the composite ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple plague occurs in the head and it is not a fracture, you should consider: if it is due to getament of pepper or similar, and the wound has already become inflamed and is large and you fear an apostema may occur, then you must immediately apply a poultice to the cephalic region, and do not delay; and extract from that wound as much blood as is necessary according to the quantity of the virtue of the medicine if there is no other cause prohibiting fleubotomia, especially if the blood that has been evacuated from the plague is little.
And be the fleubotomia of the opposite side of the wounded part; and beware the patient of replenishment, and of wine and heavy foods.
But if there is any prohibition by minute cause, then reduce the food and do not approach meat or wine.
And pause over the plague, if an apostema cautious occurs, cut into it with rosated oil or wine in which is stipticated.
But if it is certain that an apostema cautious has occurred, then pause over the plague, if it is fresh and the air has not changed the powder which I recommend in a small amount.
And if the air has already changed that, then pause over another ointment until it is healed.
But if the plague is great or is due to incision of space and similar things, and the lips of it are not adjusted for pulps, then adjust those with a suture according to how I recommend for the suturing of them.
But if the plague has already been discovered of bone and pen, and there is no retention of it except for a small suspender, then incise that and accordingly cure the plague with medicines and restore the flesh to its proper place, and command the patient to be fed with foods in which there is grease: caps and forms like them, until it is composed.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone and it does not adhere to the bone, then you should incise all that is putrid and remove it, and accordingly cure what remains.
But if in these plagues there is an artery or vein from which blood flows can occur, and it is not cut off by medicines, then you should inquire about the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you should incise it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity demands that what we have said does not come together, then you should cauterize until the blood is stopped.
And if these plagues are simple and small, then the cause of them is light; in this way you should powderize over those this powder, for it to be consolidated before the air changes those.
And the manner of the powder is this: take oil of cypress, one part; blood of dragon, two parts; and no-extinct cause, three parts. Mix it all well and grind it finely, and fill the wound with it, and constrain it with good constriction until it sticks to the wound, and coagulates with blood.
And accordingly strengthen that above with powders and leaven it, and do not remove it while it is like this until it is not inflamed, for the medicine is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is enough to do this alone, when you don't have cypress and dragon's blood at hand.
And already you are doing this same operation in large plagues when it is necessary to pause over those and be tight, and the fresh plagues with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is in summer time, then you should not have the intention to put this powder in that position, but rather cure those with what we have said, and accordingly pause over those some ointments which are changed, or pause over those powders of barley flour with water and honey until they become putrid; and accordingly cure those with the other remedy until they are healed.
But if there is a fracture in the bone and it is small, then you should extract it with gestures.
And I will say the cure for head fractures in this that is a poison.
Of the plagues of the neck.
But if the plague occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in medicine, and between the plague of the head when it is simple.
But if the nerves of the neck are cut or an artery is injured, then if it is a nerve, do not use force to avoid causing damage, but rather seek to avoid curing it with something that causes violent stiptication, such as vinegar and egg whites which resemble vitriol and similar substances that harm nerves and contract them. And do not pause over the plague any cause that is related to coldness, for the substance of nerves is cold and their continuation is in the brain, which is the most noble of all the members.
And if what is cured by medicines is light, like is washed with double water, some times infused in rosated oil or unrosated oil, and thucia when it is washed with double water and the other parts are anointed according to this manner, and ointments moist.
But if the plague is great, then administer suture, or tighten the lips of it, and accordingly cure that with powders until it is healed.
But if the plague is deep or occurs at the lowest part of putridity, then perforate it in the most depressed location.
But if in the plague an artery has been cut and bleeding occurs, then separate or dry it, or tie it, or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or all have been cut and the veins of the neck are saved, then you should adjust the lips of the spine with suture over the canal of the neck and do not touch it; before that equalize it and reduce it to its natural shape, and accordingly strengthen it with a decent stricture, and leave it for some days; and accordingly cure it with ointments in which there is stiptication and excitement until it is healed.
But if the plague has already made a breach in the bone, then percuss it, and then if there are fragments of bone, extract all that you can from them; and what remains to you, leave it until the wound is putrid, and be separated and the excrescence from it is alleviated.
And if the plague is recent, then powderize over it the powder which I have recommended. But if the plague has made a fistula, then cure it with what will be remembered in its own chapter.
If it is a percussion of a hammer or sword, and the depth of it is considerable, then consider more whether the plague has ventilation when the patient breathes; know that the plague is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the plague is recent with its own blood, then you should pause in it with the first hour powder, and not strengthen it so that the blood is not retained in the depth of it and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but rather pause in it attractive ointment, and remove it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not at your present, then you should pause in the orifice of the wound a little while, so that it sucks out what is from the moistures; and make sure that the patient sleeps on the wound so that water that is in it is adjusted.
But if three days or more have passed since the plague occurred and there is no spasme nor tremor of the heart nor stricture of the ale, and all other good dispositions are present in him, then know that the plague is saved; and accordingly cure it with poultices and with the other remedy until it is healed.
But if the healing of it is excused, and all time is opened, then know that already a fistula has been made; cure then accordingly according to its own chapter.
And if the plague is caused by incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the foot or hand, then cure it with what precedes suture, if great, or with powder, if small.
But if it has already made a breach in the bone, and you cut into it to extract those fragments, then twist the plague and pull it out to extract those fragments, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the plague becomes putrid, and the extraction of them is alleviated.
And for other plagues that occur in other members, the remedy is the same as what we have said.
Of the plagues of the belly.
The indisposition which occurs in the belly is either great, or small, or mixed.
And a small disruption is made difficult by another manner, and it seems that the reduction of theirs is more difficult, if you do not carefully bring back their introduction to its place at once, for it becomes swollen and engrossed so that the instrument of yours is made difficult.
And therefore the best disruption is mixed, for in that one it is not difficult to reduce the bowel, just as it is difficult in both species mentioned before.
And know that the suture of the belly is according to four manners, but two sutures are common which are needed in sutures of other plagues of the body.
And two other sutures, proper to it, communicate with other plagues, but nevertheless are more proper in the suture of the belly.
And I recommend to you whatsoever exposition and declaration.
Therefore I say that when the plague is small and there is some cause of the bowel through it, and it becomes difficult to reduce that, then this is in one of two ways: either by the smallness of the disruption as we have said, or when the bowel has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore when this is so, then the doctor should cut open that and submerge a sponge or wet cloth in hot water only, or soak it in warm water with cyperum, spic, and embrocate and apply it to the bowel until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes this has been done with vinegar in which there is stiptication, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And therefore when you see the inflammation to be resolved, then you should moisten the bowel with water in which is mixed alum and bitter-vetch, for by this it is alleviated the instrument of yours with little cause.
But if it is excused the instrument of yours in this correction, then you should divide the disruption a little with an instrument to which are attached bleeding points.
And the first correction is better when it is proper and not secundary, and there be no occupation to cut at the place of necessity and faintness.
Of the instrument, it sees itself in its form:
The one part of it is bent acute, and the other part not acute, and the extremity subtle, and not sharp like a spatula, but rather obtuse a little.
And therefore when the plague is amplified and is outside the bowel, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to the form of nature in its proper place, if possible above, for it is better.
But when the disruption is wide and is in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back, and position his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you should position the patient's head and feet higher than the remaining parts.
And similarly if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then pause your intention and consideration always so that the part where the plague is may be higher than the other.
And thus it is necessary that you administer this in great plagues and in mixed plagues.
And in small plagues, pause on that which is according to your preparation, and thus make the minister be among the five most skilled, who will have the disruption entirely with his hand and adjust the lips of it, and thus uncover from that to that which sees some cause for another sutura.
And this is the common suture manner: one that takes the needle, or count of needles according to the quantity of the amplitude of the plague; and thus leaves from the extremity of the disruption of the said ring finger, and strengthens the needle one, so that you do not insert faith in both extremities of the code, with two extremities of the cipher that is left out of the parts within, until it makes that penetrate from that part; and you have already added two extremities of the code and two extremities of the cipher, and are thus made four orders.
And thus strengthen with double faith in the circuit of the needle, and sometimes two parts together, and thus add the two lips and the plague by decent addition; and thus leave the thickness of the finger and put another needle in that, and thus tie that with a thread like the first needle; and do not cease to do this if it is necessary with the needles until you have completed all the tension of the plague.
And the needles should be mixed between coarseness and subtlety, for the subtle needles barely cut into the flesh; and the coarse ones are difficult to manipulate in the code, and therefore it is necessary that they be mixed in subtlety and coarseness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be inserted in two extremities of the code at once, for fear that the flesh will not be cut lightly and the plague will appear before its consolidation.
And it is not necessary to prolong the suture for fear that the plague will be prohibited from consolidation.
And thus you should insert the ends of the needles so that they do not disturb the patient's rest during sleep; and pause over the suture with expanded powders from all parts, which have the ends of the needles; and leave those in until you know that the plague is already consolidated.
And this type of suture with needles in this manner is more suitable for small plagues, because it only requires one needle or two or around those.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you administer with suture the four extremities, of the code and two extremities of the cipher, in one go, with a needle in which faith is wrapped in subtlety and coarseness.
And thus when you have the needle penetrated these four extremities, reduce the needle to that middle part from which it began, so that the faith retires from the highest point of the plague to the wound, so that the suture is like a suture of cloth with which the cloths are stretched.
And pause between each suture the quantity of the finger's thickness.
And this suture is known by men.
And with this suture, I treated the wound that had befallen a man in his belly, which had been wounded by a cutlass, and was the disruption of a greater wound of one palm, and was situated around two palms from the navel and was the disruption in the middle of the member; and then I reduced it after the bowels had been freed from the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or around, and I cared for him and he recovered; and thus he lived for many years, and is converted to his former dispositions.
And the other doctors had judged that he would not recover; and by miracle it was so, because you did not treat him with medicine, for it was in a place where no medicine was found nor any remedy, but you paused over the wound cutting twice a day and ablution assiduous with water of honey until he recovered.
But I will tell you two species of suture proper, according to the narration of Paraula.
And it is that you begin with the suture of the code, and enter the needle from the outside to the inside.
And thus when the needle pierces the code and in that place meets the lacertus according to rectitude and length of all the body, and leaves the extremity of the cipher where you have inserted the needle; and makes the needle penetrate from the inside to the outside on the other side of the thigh.
And then when you have made it penetrate, then you make it penetrate again on the same side of the thigh from outside to inside; and leave the extremity of the cipher that is in this place, and make the needle penetrate into the other extremity of the inner part to the outer part.
And make it penetrate with that penetration which you make to penetrate into the cipher in the extremity of the mirror, which is on the part of you, until all that penetrates.
And then begin on this side of the code and cut off that with the extremity of the cipher in the other place, and extract the needle from the code which has penetrated, and thus reduce it to that code and sew the extremity of the cipher that is in the other side with this extremity of the mirror; and extract that from the code which is on the part of you.
And make it so one time and another, and make it so one time after the other, until you close all that which is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you close with suture of pellicies in which you close the skin, and thus you close the cipher once with the part of the extremity of the code, and then leave it there until it is complete.
But the second proper suture which you call Gualia, and this is of sermon from above and through above recounted, is that you close with that according to semilitut in which all medicine closes it, and thus they add all part to its own similar part according to nature; and apply the extremity of one side of the body and the extremity of the mirror to the other extremity of the body, and this is done according to what you have recommended.
It is necessary that you put the needle in the extremity of the mirror at your own end from outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that same place, and leave two extremities of the cipher; and then turn the needle around and make it penetrate from outside to inside in two extremities of the cipher.
And then turn those layers around, and make them penetrate from the inside to the outside in two extremities of the mirror on the other side that are on the contrary side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common light suture, and is the suture which was previously remembered.
This is the sermon of Gualia.
And some will say that the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, so it is that you insert into these a thread, and begin with the introduction of needle from what belongs to you, and make it penetrate into the other side according to the suture of those who sew the skins together.
And you should know that when disruption is in the middle location of the belly, then the suture from above is more difficult than in other locations of the belly.
But the judgment of wound healing is the judgment of other wounds.
Which is because when you achieve the recent wound at its natural sanguineous state before it has been altered by air, and reduce the bowel and close it and adapt it decently, then pause over that flesh-like powder.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then pause over that certain ointments which are present to you until they make firm pressure and release the threads, and be consolidated cipher and mirror; and thus cure it as is the curing of other wounds until it is healed.
But if you don't have the medicines present, then pause over that as soon as possible, because it begins to rot, cut off, and exchange those two times a day, just as I teach you, until it is healed, for you won't need other medication in many dispositions when wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will spread to the main members, then it is necessary that you submerge linen in high-quality olive oil or rosated oil, and pause over that in the circuit of the places that are between the groins and leave those areas.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in your own bowels, because many times this happens, then take that and crust it with vi stiptic black tea, and especially if the purulence is progressed in the bowel and is made to exit penetrating into the cavity of the abdomen.
And you should know that what is in the thick bowel is of easier healing than what is in the subtle bowels.
And it is of difficult healing because the bowel which is called "gegunu" does not receive healing from wound that is in its entirety; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of the magnitude of it that is in those, and because of the subtlety of the body of that, and because of the proximity of that to the nature of nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is the membrane, and you achieve it fresh, reduce it according to your rectitude with which you reduce the bowels equally.
But if it has passed to the space and is already made green or black, then take that and strengthen it with thread over the location that is denigrated from above, for so that the blood flows, because in the membrane there are veins and arteries.
And then insert what is another that bond, and pause two extremities of the thread pending on the side opposite to the part left behind by the wound from above, so that over you may be alleviated the attraction of the blood vessels and emission of the arm of the wound.
Remembrance of wounds when they occur in the belly.
When disruption occurs in the belly and is small, it is possible that it may be restored in certain men, for so that you see that one who was wounded in his own belly with a blow from a lance and had a wound on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and made a fistula, and there was a great deal of swelling and ventosity.
Then you will pursue the cure of him even if it was not confirmed in his healing, but instead will subtly guide that into being whole and the place is consolidated.
And then you will see that the place is consolidated, and take pity on the patient who was afflicted by the accident in his own belly; and do not despair at all because of this evil accident and remain in their own good dispositions eating and drinking, and thus enter into a bath and be exercised in your duties.
And some experienced will say that when an injury occurs in the belly and is small, then it is necessary to bind it according to this manner: and is that you take clamps of great strength; and then adjust the two lips of the wound and pause a clamp from those which have the mouth open over the two lips of the wound; therefore when it takes on these and strengthens its mouth, cut off the head of him, for it adheres and will not be dissolved.
And then pause another clamp near the first one, and do not cease to make clamps one after another according to the quantity of all the wound.
And then reduce that and close the wound; and those clamps remain attached to the belly until the belly is healed; and do not cause any harm to the patient.
And then it is possible that the belly be bound with a fine thread made from the belly of an animal attached to it, since it is more in needle; and is that you take the extremity of these threads from the belly, and it is somewhat desiccated, and bind the extremity of it with a thread of like kind, wrapped, and then insert that thread into needles and sew with it the belly, and reduce that in disruption.
And this manner of suturing with ants is not other than according to the way of faith and hope.
But if the wound is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the subtle bowels, because then there is no other remedy but subtlety, and no healing of it all.
The Treatment of Zuchem and Fistula.
Know that every wound and abscess when it becomes inflamed and old, and is made an ulcer, and not consolidated and always gives arm, and is not abscinded, then, in whatever member it may be, universally is called fistula and we call it azuchem.
And fistula according to truth is a nodalized, hard, white tract with no pain and into which it is excavated as if it were the excavation of a bird's penance; and for this reason it is called azuchem, that is, penitence.
And it is in some men moist, which gives forth pus; and the moisture is quickly abscessed in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and little, and thick, and subtle.
And now I have shown all those causes, their signs, and the cures for them with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary that you know how to cure a fistula which is made by way of operation with me.
And know that fistula occurs in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that penetrate to the great veins and arteries, or to the nerves, or to the skull, or to the belly, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to some of the joints composed by composition as is the hand and foot; and from those there are that give proximity to the principal member and similar ones.
And therefore that one of these fistulas which is according to this manner is among the difficult-to-heal diseases, and does not receive cure, and occupation with it is toil and ignorance.
And if it is one of the fistulas that has depth beyond those places I mentioned, and you wait and hope for its cure, and want to reach understanding of it, then take a tentative approach with iron or steel, and if the fistula follows rightness, and you will seek it out.
But if the fistula is twisted, then investigate it with a tentative approach using fine lead, because lead with the lightness of its own body is alleviated and curved to follow the twisting.
And if the fistula is accompanied by many horrid things, it is not for you to attempt to signify upon it.
Then clog the orifice with its own orifices, for the moisture which you clog it with will flow into the other orifices and drain them.
And then inquire with great care, according to which manner it is possible for you to know whether there are bones or nerves here, and if the fistula is distant or near, or if it is a fistula that has many orifices and is located above everything else, with the sum of your strength, with your understanding, by which you understand the patient, and the invention of pain, according to your compression on the place, and similar signs and causes that occur in abscess.
And when you have stood over all those causes with true understanding, then come to the cure according to confidence: and it is that you consider whether it is an apparent fistula nearby or in a place of salt, distant from junction, or nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have said to you.
And then you will secure the fistula according to what has been said previously about its narration, and hold back that which is in that filtration and corrupted flesh, and that which has grown out of the orifice of the flesh, or of the bile and similar things, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth and is according to rightness, then it is necessary that you insert that into the preon as far as possible for you, and appropriate purify that of all its corrupted flesh; and appropriate administer some enveloped in acute medicines, and introduce those into the cavity of the fistula, which you have comprehended with iron.
And then make that with the acute medicine, after some times, until it corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
And then restore that with engendering those which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by that, then you will cauterize it according to what we have recommended.
But if the cause of fistula is bone and you are certain about that, then you will inquire into it and secure it according to what we have recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or main member as we have said.
But if the bone is revealed to you and there is corruption and blackness in it, then you will root out that which causes the corruption until it is completely removed; and appropriate cure that with what encloses it until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and gives forth pus as before, then you should know that you have not reached the complete eradication of corruption; and therefore you should uncover the underlying reason for it and make a thorough examination of it, and purify it with the strongest force at your disposal, and appropriate restore that.
And therefore if it is healed, good is; and otherwise, you should know that this corruption is in the profound depth of the heart, which has not been reached, and thus at your hands there is nothing but to leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to draw it out, then you will draw it out with subtle forceps which are suitable for that.
And if there are many bones, then carefully extract all of them, and from those leave not a single cause with your strength.
But if at your hands some cause of humors makes you contrary, and in them there is no fear or error, then you will insert those ligaments or flesh if they are here, and deliver the bones.
But if you are not prepared to take out the bones of your hour, then pause on the wound that wounds the wound, and leave it until this is around the bones of flesh and ligaments, and keep the wound from being consolidated, and constrict the section which you have inserted in your operation.
They had said, if you are afraid, pause over the wound submerged in a bath of olive oil, or wound submerged in Egyptian resin, or in some of the verdant ointments, because when those ligaments will be purified, and the bones will be separated from their ablution, and the attraction is alleviated.
But if it is a great bone like the bone of the hip or of the spine or similar to those, and what is corrupted on it is only the surface, then you will root out that with a resolvent as much behind as needed until that blackness and corruption are removed, and appropriate restore the wound.
But if what is corrupted on it is a great part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and thoroughly insert everything into the place where the corruption has occurred, and then cure that until it is consolidated.
And I recommend to you that you seek out one man in his own coxa (or hip) so that you may pause over it and exemplify and assist on your operation.
Find a young man of age around xxx years, to whom it happens that he feels pain in his coxa (or hip), and from the inner parts that are made outside is above the matter outside the heart until the matter reaches the coxa, and it is material of apostema with great apostema, and there is no external cause.
And then the time was extended with that by the error of doctors until the apostema was burst, and it poured forth many matters, and its cure was approximately paused until the hip became fistulada (fistula-like), and they were filled with many orifices which all poured forth pus and bodily fluids.
And then many doctors were cured around two years ago, but they did not have knowledge in the art, until you were called.
And I saw the hip of that man and the matters that were flowing from it through great veins; and his body was already all stabilized and the color of it was citrine.
And then I inserted a tent into one of those orifices and brought it to the bone.
And then you and I inspected all the orifices, and found those that came from all parts of the hip.
And then you took me and inserted me into one of those orifices until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found that it was corrupted, and already rotten and decayed; and already a part of the hip had become corrupted to the extent that it had penetrated into the socket.
And then I saw what was discovered and prepared for me from the bone uncovered.
And I saw that it was not in the bone, but that corruption which had abscessed and spread, and I had already dissected.
And then I paused the restoration of the wound with consolidative medicine for a long time, and it was not consolidated.
And then I iterated and discovered over the bone secondarily after the primary discovery, and found continuous corruption in the bone.
And I saw that it appeared to me from that corruption, and then you were perforated to make the cure of it and restoration, but it was not restored.
And then I discovered on the other side and did not cease to insert the small bone little by little particularly and perforate the restoration of it, but it was not restored until I inserted around one palm of it, and that extracted with its marrow, and then restored it with medicines, and it is consolidated slightly and healed.
And it is not necessary to iterate in the operation of it and section of it, but rather by the disposition of the fleshiness of it and by the paucity of the tolerance of it and fear of death, for it happened to him at all hours due to superfluous evacuation, bad syncope.
And therefore, he was cured through entire healing, and nothing is in the place of bone hard cartilage; and it has been made good the disposition of him in his own body and returned to its virtue; and it has been converted into its own dispositions, and did not cause contrary disturbance in ambulation or harm in any way.
But if it is bone elevated in place of the body already torn, then you should do that according to this manner: and it is that you take a ligament and strengthen it at the extremity of that elevated bone, and command someone to extend it there; and pause that ligament of wool more thick than the first ligament; and appropriate tie that over the flesh that is left from the bone, and stretch the extremity of it so that you attract the flesh to the parts left behind, and you uncover the flesh over the place which you want to cut off in order that the cutting does not injure the flesh.
And pause fist or table left from the bone downwardly, because when you do this, it is not prohibited for the knife to cut off the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the cutting be done gradually over the corrupted area, because if it is in the concavity of the bone corruption and does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and perhaps another way must be cut off.
And if the bone is corrupted and not elevated, beforehand it is one continued part with the other, and the corruption is in the middle place or in a part of it, then you will uncover the flesh from all parts entirely; and then pause fist left over, and then cut off that from the first part where the corruption is, until the cutting of the other part is continued.
And let the cutting be according to the place of the corruption, a little bit, as we have said.
And if the corruption is at the joint, dissect that corrupted joint, and cut off the bone where it continues from the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in reason, but rather a natural occurrence.
And if the corruption is in the pectoral region of the arm or leg, it is very difficult; however, you must inquire into the corruption in what manner it appears to you, and that you should uncover it, and correct it according to any disposition which is possible for you, and with all natural ease be rectified by you, when it does not come into conflict with your veins or nerves.
And know what are the instruments and the cuts to be made in these bones are many according to the situation of the bones, and the preparation of them, and their thickness, subtlety, greatness, smallness, hardness, and rarity; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for all types of operation the suitable instrument for that operation.
And know that this operation signifies to you the species of the instrument which you need; when with you is great study and long and deep knowledge of the manners of this art, and testimony of manners of diseases, for then already you have them by yourself in what is convenient for all instruments to every disease.
And you will have formed at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which I shall pause with as simple ones, and those with which you will process according to your prohibition, which you will experience on others. Forma de serra:

E si del sinu aprop motz dias es yssit brac indigest, lahoras sapias que·l sinu no adhereys; e si es tardada la adherencia del sinu e es la causa prolonguada, lahoras tu ajusta en exsiccacio de las medicinas, e si las medicinas so humidas en lor substancia e en la sua vertut, son seccas ayssi cum enguent dyafinicon, quan es en lu ajustada superfluitat de addicio de zegi.
E le mays derier am le qual es curat, es que prenguas de enguent dyafinicon e sia dissout en oli rozat, e sia sobre lu vojat vi antic engual en la sua substancia, e aprop comfeys aquel am lu, e usa de aquel.
E ja fa semblant en aquela accio, quan no y a brac, enguent dyafinicon, mel quan es coyt entro que sia engrossat, e usa de lu; o que prenguas mirra e aloen e enses, e trissa tot e polveriza sobre le mel quan es sus le foc, e aprop lineys aquo sobre drap e strenh aquel sobre le sinu; e lineys aquel am le mel le qual has cuoyt entro que es engrossat, e polveriza sobre drap e strenh aquel.
E alcunas veguadas so administratz am lu aristologia longua e razitz de lili celesti (e es lili celesti) e farina de errs e centaurea, e usa de aquels simples o ajustatz, trissa aquels e cribela e polveriza sobre le mel le qual he recomtat; e husa de lu.
E si es prolonguat le sinu, e no es sanat per aquesta curacio, lahoras sapias que la corrupcio es en le preon de lu, e ja fa enquisicio en les osses o en les autres membres durs o als liaments; lahoras tu le cura am curacio fistular, ayssi cum desus es dit.
De curacio de panarici et unguis attritae et incisione digiti additi et sectione.
Panarici es apostema le qual nays dejos la ungla del dit pous de la ma o del pe, e fort leu nays en les autres ditz, e cum es prolonguat e la sua curacio es mens prezada, o es apostemat de apostema caut, o es corrumput, e gieta brac entro que corrodeys la razitz de la ungla, e fort leu corromp aquela tota, e fort leu perve la sua corrupcio al os entro que es a lu odor fetent, e es fayta la extremitat del dit lada, e la color de lu es fayta fusca.
E donc quan tu auras aquel am aquo que havem dit en la divisio e no comfereys la tua curacio, lahoras cove que tu inscidas am ferr tota la superfluitat que es romasa de la ungla e aprop cauteriza la plagla aprop aquo, quar cauteri mot es juvatiu en aysso.
Mays si le os es sa e la ungla es sana, e las addicions de la ungla vuoydas ja compremen las carns a les partidas dedintz, e comensan lu punger e ledeysso aquela, lahoras cove que tu pauses ray subtil dejos le angle de la ungla que pungeys la carn, e impelleys aquela sus e inscideys aquela carn am facilitat, e pausa sobre aquo que roman de la carn de las medicinas comburentz corrosivas entro que sia tot remaugut; e aprop cura aquel am enguentz entro que sia sanat.
Mays si la corrupcio ja enprem en le os, lahoras cove que tu inscidas le os aquel e le extraguas, car nul temps no es sanat que sia en lu le os corrumput.
E si vezes la corrozio e la corupcio anar en le dit, lahoras tu inscideys aquel en un dels nozes segons que es premesa la sua rememoracio, e aprop cura aquel entro que sia sant.
Mays si a la ungla endeve percussio o atricio, e endeve en aquela dolor vehement, lahoras cove que tu al comensament fleubotomes le malaute, e aprop secca la ungla am spatum agut am seccio transversa desus en jus, e guarda te que la seccio no pervengua entro a la carn que es dejos la ungla, quar tu faras accidir al malaute dolor vehement, e sira causa a nativitat de la carn ajustada superflua en le loc; e aprop cura aquel loc am aquo que ceda dolor.
Mays dit ajustat, le qual es nat en las mas de alcus homes, fort leu es carnos tot, e fort leu so en lu osses, o fort leu es en lu ungla.
E alcus de lu son natz en la razit de la junctura, o es la nativitat de lu en alcus nozes dels ditz. Mays aquel que es nat en alcus nozes del dit no se mau, e aquest que es nat en las juncturas fort leu es maugut.
E de aquels que son natz carnoses, la seccio es leugiera, e es que tu inscidas aquel deves la sua razitz am spatum lat.
Mays de aquel que es nat en la razitz de la junctura, la curacio es difficil; e donc guarda te de la abscezio de lu.
Mays en aquel que es nat en dit deves les nozes, cove que tu inscidas al comensament la carn de lu am inscizio redonda entro al os, e aprop serra am una de aquellas serras convenientz ad aquo, e aprop cura aquel entro que sia sant.
Mays consolidacio la qual accideys als ditz entre lor motas veguadas o per nativitat del home que nays enayssi, o per consolidacio de plagua o per combustio de foc, o per semblantz, adonc cove que secces aquela consolidacio entro que les ditz retorno a la sua forma natural.
E aprop pausa entre lor draps de li enfuzes en oli rozat per que no sian consolidatz leugierament, e separa entre aquels, o pausa entre aquels una lamina de plom subtil entro que sia consolidat segon que cove.
E semblantment si accideys consolidacio en alcus ditz am la palma, lahoras tu secca aquela consolidacio segon que es preparada e conveneys a la figura del membre.
De inscizio de vices, so son varicas.
Vices so son varicas, e so venas envolutas grossas plenas de superfluitatz melencolicas las quals veno en motz dels membres del cors, e le major adveniment de lor en las cambas, e majorment en las cambas dels itinerantz e dels laborantz e dels portantz.
Adonc cove que tu administres purguacio del cors de colera negra alcunas veguadas am expulcio fort, e aprop sangna le pacient de la vena basilica.
Mays la curacio de lor am ferr es segon dos manieyras: la una es que sia inscizas e sia atirat aquel sanc negre, e l’autra manieyra es que sia elevada la vena e sia extrayta tota.
La seccio de lu es segon aquesta manieyra: embroca al comensament la camba am aygua cauda mot entro que le sanc gros sia resolvut, que es feculent de la camba, e aprop strenh la camba del malaute a la partida pus sobirana de la coyssa entro a la partida dejos del denol am una benda, e aprop secca la vena en un loc, o en dos, o en tres am seccio ampla, e aprop eleva le sanc negra am la tieua ma de la partida dejos de la camba entro en sus, e desus en jus, entro que del sanc sia yssida la quantitat que voles e que vezes habastar, e la qual tollera la vertut del malaute.
E aprop lia aquella, e comanda a lu que abstengua de las viandas colera negra engendrantz.
E itera la curacio per fleubotomia quan las venas so umplidas e aquo notz al malaute.
Mays la elevacio de lor es segon aquesta manieyra: tu que razas la camba del malaute, si en lu so motz pels, e aprop met le en banh e embroca la camba de lu am aygua cauda entro que s’enrogesesca e las venas sian exuberadas; o que sia exercitat per exercici fort, si banh no es a tu present, entro que·l membre sia scalfat.
E aprop secsa la codena en le dreyt de la vena per seccio en le lonc o en le derier de lu deves le denol, o en le pus bas de lu deves lo talo.
E aprop uobre la codena am uncis e excorja la vena de tota part entro que appara al sentiment, e es deves la appericio de lu que vezes aquella roga declinant a negror.
E donc cum evazeys e de la codena tu vezes aquela blanca quays sia corda.
E aprop tu met dejos aquela le ray entro que sia elevada e sia gitada de la codena, e sospen aquela am onci orp leon.
E aprop secsa autra seccio aprop aquela seccio per tres ditz, e aprop excorja la codena de la partida desus de la vena entro que apparia.
E aprop eleva aquela e inscideys aquela en deriera seccio deves le talo, e aprop extratz aquela e eleva aquela entro que sia yssida per la seccio segonda, e aprop extratz aquela de la seccio que es sobre aquela.
E fay aquo entro que extraguas aquela de la seccio que es pus sobirana o pus auta de totas las seccios, entro que tota es yssida; e lahoras inscideys aquela.
E si no obezeys a tu ad extrayre e elevar, lahoras intromet una agulha am fiel fort doble e ligua aquela e extratz la, o intromet dejos lu le ray e revolveys la tua ma a tota part entro qu’en sia getada. E guarda te que no sia inscidida; quar si es trencada, es fayt a tu dificil elevar aquela mot e es vengut sobre le malaute per aquela nocument.
E cum aquela tota auras fora-gitada, lahoras pausa sobre le loc de la plagua lana submerssa en vi e olirozat e oli non-ruzat, e cura aquel entro que sia sanit.
E si la vit es contrayta havent tortuositat a la qual sia envolucio a las partidas, e no es segon rectitut segon que havem dit, lahoras cove que tu fendas sobre aquela a tota partida de tortuositat de lu e als locs de envolucio de lu, e aprop suspen aquela am uncis entro que eleves aquela tota.
E guarda te deves la tua seccio que no inscidas la vena e que no plagues aquela, quar dificil sira a tu elevar aquela; e serva la tua prudencia en aquela.

The text is discussing the signs or symptoms of fracture of the bone! The text is discussing the recognition of a fractured bone and its symptoms!
The text is discussing the diagnosis of a fractured bone!
The text is discussing the possibility of a fracture or small crack in the bone, and the need to carefully evaluate and treat the situation!
The text is discussing the importance of recognizing and treating a curved bone (arcuat) that has not been split in two or caused other complications, such as apoplectic fits!
The text is discussing the treatment of an apoplectic fit (apostema) and the importance of allowing the patient to rest for several days before attempting to move or manipulate them!
The text is stating that the restoration and alignment of a curved bone (e) is easier than correcting a satagie-related issue in the os!
The text is emphasizing the importance of strengthening oneself according to what will come in the future, based on one's memory!
The text is discussing the treatment of satagias (apoplectic fits) in the os (bone), and suggesting that if they occur, it may be necessary to extend the affected member (e.g. arm or leg) by cutting it off at two points, or using a combination of ropes or cord.
The text is discussing the importance of positioning the affected member in a way that allows it to be naturally aligned, while the parts are extended from the amputated limb. The text emphasizes the need to return these additional parts to their natural positions using engineering and various methods.
The text is advising the reader to take care of themselves and avoid causing harm or injury to others through their actions, whether it be through surgery (operacio) or other forms of treatment.
The text is advising the reader to make use of their skills and abilities in a meaningful way at that moment, and if there is some other cause or factor involved, adjust and align themselves according to the quantity of their virtue.
The text is warning against excessive and forceful extension and compression, as foolish surgeons often do, causing apoplectic fits or contractions in the affected limb.
The text is discussing the quality of the fixation (strictura) of the limb, stating that it should be done in a way that respects the natural differences and characteristics of each individual's limbs.
The text is discussing the wrapping or bandaging of small limbs, such as arms and legs, suggesting that a thin and delicate cloth should be used.
The text is discussing the wrapping or bandaging of larger limbs, such as the torso and thigh, suggesting that a thicker and more robust cloth should be used to provide support and stability.
The text is advising the reader to begin by evacuating (emptying) their equations and pausing for a moment, then apply pressure (liament) to the area of fracture, wrapping it with three or four layers according to what the limb requires. The reader should also use their hand to provide gentle pressure.
The text is advising the reader to approach the fracture site with caution and care, strengthening the area of the fracture before applying pressure. The text is advising the reader to gradually stretch out the wrapping (envolucio) around the fracture site, and then gently relax the structure (strictura) bit by bit, until you take hold of the location with a large part.
The text is advising the reader to take another bandage and wrap it around the previously wrapped area (loc trenquat) with the wrapping, and then approach the wraps at the point of departure from the fracture; and let your operation be in the structure of the wrapping and in the relaxation of that, according to what we have said above.
The text is advising the reader to pause between the wraps and apply pressure with a cloth or fabric that matches the curvature of the fracture, if there is curvature; and otherwise, do not pause at all.
The text is advising the reader to pause on top of another bandage, and then apply gentle pressure over these wraps (envolucios) as necessary, if there is no swelling or apoplectic fit (apostema caut); and wait for some days; and then strengthen the wraps.

The text is describing the method of applying emplausters (bandages or wraps) to treat fractures, with a focus on complexity and particularly for women and children, as they are more delicate and require a gentle approach. The text also mentions that it is important not to apply heat or cold to the area.
The text is providing additional guidance on how to apply the emplausters (bandages or wraps) to treat fractures. Specifically, it advises:
Another method for applying an ointment to restore fracture, dislocation, and twisting: recipe of assafetida, ladanum, acacia, enula, and myrrh, which is the root of saved mullen, one drachma each; of myrrh and aloes, one drachma five; of alochil, twenty drachmae; all are ground and sifted and mixed with water or albumen of egg if the patient's condition is scarred; and then use this ointment, because it is of good composition and restores broken bones slightly, and gives strength to men.
Another method for applying an ointment that gives strength to fracture and twisting: recipe of myrrh and white turpentine, one drachma each; of myrrh and aloes, one drachma five; of acacia, six drachmae; of Armenian balm, twenty drachmae.
