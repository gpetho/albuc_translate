 CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR.
On incising the ligament below the tongue which is an impediment to speech.
 Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural and congenital; or it may be accidental, owing to scarring from an injury.
The operation for it is to open the patient's mouth, having his head in your lap, and lift his tongue; then cut that sinew-like ligament transversely till the tongue is freed from its hold.
If it is hard and nodular, arising from scarring after an injury, catch it with a hook and slit it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots undone.
Beware of making the incision deeply into the flesh, or you may cut an artery there and haemorrhage may occur.
After the cutting, let him rinse with rose-water or vinegar and cold water.
Then put under the tongue a pad of linen, which the patient must keep in position at night to prevent the adhesion from forming again.
If there should be haemorrhage, put pounded vitriol on the place; and if bleeding still prevails burn the spot with a lenticular cautery of suitable size and treat in the usual way till healed.
