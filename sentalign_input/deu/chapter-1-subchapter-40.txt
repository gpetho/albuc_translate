Chapter Forty:
On the cauterization of hip dislocation.
When mucous-like humidity is deposited in the hip area, causing dislocation, and a sign of this is that one thigh is longer than the other when compared.
And the location of the dislocation is found in the hollow area.
Then you should cauterize the patient on the hip area with a circular cauterization, after marking with a probe around the affected part so that the area falls in the middle of the circle.
The cautery should have the same form as described in the cauterization of the stomach.
If this cautery is not available, then cauterize with three large olive-like cauterizations.
The cauterization should be done to the depth of the entire scab; and then treat the area until it heals.
