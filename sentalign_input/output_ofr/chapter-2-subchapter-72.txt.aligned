Erysipelas occurs when a woman's genitals are not perforated, or the opening is small; and this is natural by birth, or accidental due to a disease that has occurred; or it is due to extra flesh, or from a thin or thick syfac, and it is located deep in the uterus, or on the sides, or underneath, or wherever it may be; and it prevents conception, and childbirth, and sometimes menstruation; and the diagnosis of this is by examination of the vulva.	This condition is when a woman's pudenda have no opening or have only a tiny opening; it may be either congenital or acquired. The acquired sort is due to some preceding disease; either to a fleshy growth or to a membrane, thick or thin. It may be in the fundus of the uterus or in its walls or in the upper part or in the lower part; and it prevents intercourse, conception, and delivery; it often also hinders the menses. This is recognized by inspection by the midwife, if the obstruction be obvious and low.	0.8092961
If the blockage is near and visible, then search with your fingers or with a probe.	This is recognized by inspection by the midwife, if the obstruction be obvious and low. But if it be not visible she should palpate with her fingers or with a probe.	0.63271105
If it is from a thin syfac, and it is close to the two labia, then hurry, and break it thus: put your two index fingers together, and have the woman lie on her back, with her legs spread; then stretch the two labia firmly, until the thin syfac is broken, and the blockage is opened; then take wool, and soak it in oil, and put it on the spot, and let the woman lie still every day, so that it cannot close up.	And when the obstruction is due to a thin membrane near the labia you should lose no time in breaking it down. This is done by applying some sort of pad to the labia; then put both thumbs upon it. The woman should be upon her back with her legs spread wide apart; then the labia are to be stretched strongly till the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is laid open. Then take wool soaked in oil and apply to the place, and let the woman engage in coitus every day lest the place close over.	0.8368984
And if the syfac is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a myrtle-leaf shaped scalpel.	If the membrane be thick and strong you should incise it with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel.	0.77310276
If the blockage is from excess flesh, then lift it with a hook and cut it; and have medicines to stop the bleeding, such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, together with egg white; then insert a wide lead tube, so that the wound cannot close; and let it remain thus for a long time, and apply a dry linen tent; then treat with other remedies until it is healed.	And have at hand remedies for allaying haemorrhage without pain, such as acacia and dragon's blood and olibanum, all mixed with egg-white. Then use a cannula of lead to prevent the wound healing up too quickly. She should keep it in position for some days and employ a bandage of dry linen. Then treat with the usual healing dressings until it heals.	0.7477404
And when excess flesh grows in the womb, it must be cut in this manner, unless it is a malignant abscess. For a malignant abscess that is in the womb, one should not touch it with iron.	Sometimes other growths of flesh arise in the uterus itself; you should cut away in this manner all except cancerous tumours; for a cancerous tumour arising in the uterus is under no circumstance to be treated with the knife.	0.64158374
