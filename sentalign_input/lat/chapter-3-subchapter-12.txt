On the restoration of a fracture of the arm.
Chapter XIII.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two forearm bones.
One of which is small: it is the one that follows the thumb.
And the other is large, and is located beneath the small one from the lower part.
Thus, perhaps the larger bone alone breaks, or the smaller one; or perhaps they break together.
When the smaller bone is broken at the upper part, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the lower bone is broken, its fracture is bad, and its healing difficult.
And it is worse when both bones are broken together.
If, therefore, the broken bone is the smaller upper one, it is fitting for the doctor in its restoration to apply a gentle extension until it is aligned.
But if the larger bone is the one that is broken, then it is necessary to apply a much stronger binding.
And it is necessary to position the hand appropriately for its restoration, and extend it on a cushion.
And the thumb of the hand should be elevated above all the fingers, and the joint lower than all the other fingers, or the rest; and the patient should sit upright, and the cushion should be placed in front of him, or at his level, so that the patient does not experience discomfort.
Then the assistant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a band.
And another assistant extends it from above in the same way.
Then the doctor aligns the bone until he restores it to the best shape possible.
If there are splinters in the bone fracture, then try to return each fragment to its place with your skill.
But if a separated splinter appears in it and pricks the skin, and you have no hope of restoring it, then cut above it and remove it according to the method we have previously mentioned.
If, however, the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already dedicated a specific chapter to it; therefore, take the treatment for it from there.
If, at the beginning of your restoration, a warm swelling occurs, then line a cloth with a salve made from rose oil and white wax, at a medium consistency between thick and thin, and bind the cloth gently over it until the swelling subsides; then remove the salve and place a plaster prepared from mill dust mixed with egg white.
Then place the splints, and the splint that is placed over the fracture should be somewhat wider and stronger.
And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases, whether the fracture is in one forearm bone or both.
Then place your binding tighter and stronger over the site of the fracture, and somewhat more toward the upper or lower part of the fracture; or make the binding slightly looser, as previously mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture be soft, moist cloths; they should not be hard or rough.
And the thread with which it is bound should be of proper linen, medium between thin and thick, as we have described.
And examine the limb and the binding after several days.
If anything occurs that requires correction, such as itching of the limb, then it is necessary to wash the limb with warm water until the itching subsides, and let the limb be unbound until it calms down, then reapply the binding.
If the binding has already loosened, and the bone has already shifted, or similar issues arise, then correct it all with your skill, and examine it again.
For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive binding, then you should loosen it slightly and leave it for several days until nourishment reaches it again, then rebind it.
If none of these issues we have mentioned occur to the patient, then it should not be loosened until after twenty days or around that time.
Then the patientâ€™s hand should be suspended from his neck.
And let his neck be kept straight, and protected from agitating movements by its own strength.
And have him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture heals in thirty or thirty-two days, and perhaps in twenty-eight days.
All of this depends on the conditions of constitutions and the arrangements of strength.
