There is another type of disease which is called "corrodens," and it is nothing other than a consumption of the limb, for it eats away at the limbs as fire does dry wood.	Gangrene is a creeping corruption of a limb, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood.	0.47249848
If you see this disease in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat cauteries, both small and large nails, according to what is suitable for the place where the disease is; then cauterize it on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that is corrupted is removed.	If you see gangrene in a part which can tolerate the actual cautery, heat a number of claviform cauteries, small or large to suit the site of the gangrene. Then cauterize it all over till the whole corruption is eradicated and none remains.	0.740523
And then leave it for three days, and apply on the cauterized areas ground sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.	Then let be for three days, applying to the cauterized site sulphur beaten up with oil, until the whole eschar comes away, and all the corruption.	0.8830722
Afterwards treat it with ointments that generate flesh.	Then treat with stimulating ointments.	0.7295399
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh is not growing, that's good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted areas.	If after three days you see the flesh growing healthily and no corruption in it, good. Otherwise repeat the cauterization over whatever corrupt parts are left.	0.8708086
And this affliction has sometimes been treated with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery; but nevertheless fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already explained the treatment with the sharp medicine in the section: take it when you need it.	Gangrene is also sometimes cured with caustic, for that takes the place of fire; but the actual cautery acts more speedily. I have already spoken of the treatment of it by caustic in its section, so take it from there when you have need of it.	0.7665534
