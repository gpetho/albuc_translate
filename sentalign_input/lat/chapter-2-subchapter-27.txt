On the extraction of nodules from the lips.
Chapter 27.
Many people develop hard nodules within their lips that resemble small herb seeds, with some larger and others smaller.
You must turn the lip inside out, cut over each nodule, suspend it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Then fill the incision site with ground alum until the bleeding stops.
Afterward, rinse with vinegar and treat the area with a styptic until the wounds heal.
