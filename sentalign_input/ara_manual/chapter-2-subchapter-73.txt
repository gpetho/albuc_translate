Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids, Warts, and Red Pustules That Occur in Women's Genitals.
Hemorrhoids are the swelling of the openings of veins until much blood constantly flows from them. When hemorrhoids become chronic, they turn into warts. I have mentioned their types and signs in the classification, and we will mention them here.
What can be treated and what cannot be treated. I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep in the uterus and cannot be felt, cannot be treated with an iron instrument. Those that are at the mouth of the uterus and can be felt are the ones that can be treated.
The woman should enter a cool room, then stretch the warts with forceps or a coarse cloth and cut them from their roots. Then, when the blood flows, sprinkle on them one of the styptic powders that stops bleeding without cauterization.
Such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, and the like. Then raise her legs against the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding continues, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts, and the like. Then take barley flour and knead it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it as a poultice on her back. If the bleeding stops, then good. Otherwise, apply cupping to the back and breasts without scarification. Then take cotton and soak it in the juice of purslane or the juice of plantain or the juice of blackberry branches with a decoction of gallnuts and apply it to the area.
When the swelling subsides, treat the area with the ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the tips of nettles, rough in appearance.  You should cut off what appears of it in the same way as I mentioned for warts, and treat it until it heals.
