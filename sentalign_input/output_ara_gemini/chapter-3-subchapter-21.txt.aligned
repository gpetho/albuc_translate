Chapter twenty-one on the treatment of a fracture if it has healed and the limb remains.	CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE. On the treatment of a fracture when, after repair, the limb remains unnaturally thin.	0.6727931
After that, it becomes thin, unlike its original nature, if the bone fracture heals, and the limb remains thin and weak, then this is due to many reasons, one of which is either due to the frequent loosening of the ligaments and tying them in a way that is not appropriate. Or due to excessive tightening of the ligaments until the nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb. Or due to excessive and frequent suspension/dangling. Or due to excessive movements at the wrong time.	When a fractured bone has been repaired but the limb remains thin and weak, this may be due to many causes: the bandaging being too often loosened and not properly tightened; or excessive binding-up so that nourishment cannot flow to the limb; or excessive fomenting; or excessive and premature movement; or the thinness and weakness of the patient's blood.	0.7452321
And the treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body until the blood increases in it, and to use the bath, and to bring him joy and happiness, and so on.	The treatment of this consists in the nourishing and restoring of his body so there be plenty of blood; and the use of the bath; and cheering the patient and making him happy, and so on.	0.88095206
Then apply tar to the limb so that the tar attracts a lot of nourishment to it, or continue suspending/dangling it with lukewarm water until the nourishment flows into it and it returns to its natural shape.	Then apply pitch to the limb so that it may draw much nourishment to itself, or continue the massage to the limb with tepid water, so that nourishment flows in the limb and it returns to its normal shape.	0.8405603
