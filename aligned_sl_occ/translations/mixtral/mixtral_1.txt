Oh, son, as I have completed this book for you, which is the culmination of the medical science, and having reached its end and explained its contents, it seems to me that I should also present this treatise to you, which is a part of the practice with my hand, that is, surgery.
For the practice with my hand is almost entirely extinct in our region and time, so that the science of it is nearly lost and its traces are barely visible. Only some small descriptions remain in the books of the Ancients, which have been altered by later writers leading to errors and misunderstandings, so that the intentions of the art have become hidden and its strength has diminished.
And it seems to me that I should revive that practice through the organization of this treatise, in accordance with the path of explanation and clarification and abbreviation; and so that it can be understood with the forms of the cautery tools and other instruments of the work, along with an added explanation and preparation, which is necessary.
But the reason why a skilled practitioner is not found with his hand in our time is because the art of medicine is complex and its actor must be well-versed in the science of anatomy, which Galen defined as having knowledge of the functions of the members and their forms, and their conjunction and separation. And one must have knowledge of bones, nerves, and tendons, along with their number and function; and of the pulsatile and non-pulsatile veins, and the locations of their issuance.
And for this reason Hippocrates said that a name is one thing, but the work is another, and particularly in the art of practice with the hand.
But we have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book, for whoever does not understand what we have said about anatomy is not fit to avoid error and will cause death, just as I have seen many times, for some are trained in this science but throw it aside without knowledge or experience.
For I saw a foolish doctor who attempted to lance an abscess on a woman's neck and cut some of the arteries in her neck, causing a great flow of blood that killed the woman with his own hands.
And I saw another doctor who tried to extract a stone from a man's bladder, and the stone was large. He attempted it but only managed to remove part of the bladder along with the stone, causing the man to die three days later.
And I myself had once been called to attend such a case and saw that due to the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
And I saw another doctor who was paid by a duke in our land to perform surgery, and he treated a black castellan who had a fracture on his hip. The doctor's ignorance led him to treat the injury with tight bandages of padding and splints over the wound, not allowing it to breathe. [
And he tied him up according to his wishes and bound him, leaving it like that for several days and ordering us to loosen the bandages slightly. But this went on until both the hip and leg had become infected, leading to further complications. (The text is describing a medical procedure where a patient with a fractured hip has been treated with tight bandages, making it difficult for the wound to heal properly. The author criticizes the treatment as inappropriate and potentially harmful.)
And I was called to treat him, and after loosening the bandages, he became calm and free from pain. (The text is describing a medical procedure where a patient with a fractured hip has been treated with tight bandages, making it difficult for the wound to heal properly. The author criticizes the treatment as inappropriate and potentially harmful, and describes how they were able to help the patient by loosening the bandages.)
But the infection had already taken hold in his limb and I was unable to stop it from spreading further, despite my efforts. The corruption continued to spread throughout his body until he was at risk of dying from sepsis. (The text is describing a medical procedure where a patient with a fractured hip has been treated with tight bandages, making it difficult for the wound to heal properly. The author criticizes the treatment as inappropriate and potentially harmful, and describes how they were unable to completely cure the infection that had developed due to the poor treatment.)
I saw another doctor who lanced a cancerous abscess and it became ulcerated for several days, until the illness was greatly exacerbated by its master. (The text is describing a medical procedure where a patient with an abscess has been treated by having it lanced. The author criticizes the treatment as inappropriate and potentially harmful, as the abscess became ulcerated for several days and the patient's condition worsened.)
The reason for this is that cancerous flesh is pure black bile, and it is not appropriate to treat it with sharp instruments, but rather to place it in a member that can endure it completely. (The text is describing the proper treatment of cancerous flesh, which should not be treated with sharp instruments as it is made up of black bile. Instead, the author advises placing it in a location where it can be fully contained and controlled.)
And for this reason, son, it is necessary that the practice with my hand be divided into two categories: one is associated with health and safety, and the other involves risk in more complex cases. (The author advises that medical procedures should be categorized as either safe or risky, with the latter involving more complex cases where there may be a greater chance of complications or harm to the patient.)
I have already addressed this throughout the entirety of this book, where I discussed procedures involving error and fear. It is necessary for you to take heed of this and avoid such cases, so that the pages do not lead you astray and dishonor you. (The author advises the reader to be cautious and avoid medical procedures that involve a high level of risk or uncertainty.)
Therefore, take up your arms with diligence and under the protection of God, and approach your patients with ease and confidence. (The author advises the reader to be prepared and confident when approaching medical procedures, seeking guidance from a higher power and using their skills and knowledge to help those in need.)
And use the best approach by the grace of God for health and successful healing, and leave behind terrible illnesses that are difficult to cure, and put aside your weapons from that which causes fear in you, so that hesitation in your faith and in your name does not overcome you. For it is left to your glory, and more will remain for your memory and for the sanctity of your name. (The author advises the reader to focus on providing the best care possible, using their skills and knowledge to bring about healing and success for their patients. They should avoid being deterred by difficult cases or fear, instead relying on their faith and the protection of a higher power to guide them in their work.)
Galen also said in some of his teachings: (The text is introducing a quote from Galen, a prominent ancient Greek physician and philosopher, who is often cited as an authority on medical matters in medieval texts.) "Do not treat a bad illness badly, lest you be called bad doctors." (Galen advises against providing poor medical care, as it will reflect poorly on the doctor's reputation and abilities.)
I have divided this book into three chapters. (The author has organized their text into three main sections or chapters, which may be grouped thematically or by subject matter.)
Here begins the division of the book, starting with the first section. (The author is introducing the first part of their text, which will likely be followed by additional sections or chapters.) The first chapter is about the head to the feet, including the forms of instruments and cautery tools, as well as what is necessary for the procedure. (The author has organized their text into chapters, with this first chapter focusing on the proper use of medical instruments and tools in treating patients from head to toe.)
The division of the second section. (The author is introducing the second part of their text, which will likely be followed by additional sections or chapters.) The second chapter is about dryness and perforation, as well as cupping glasses, ulcers, and the extraction of arrows and similar items, all categorized and organized by the forms of instruments. (The author has organized their text into chapters, with this second chapter focusing on various medical procedures related to dryness, wounds, and the removal of foreign objects, including arrows, using a variety of tools and techniques.)
The third chapter is about restoration and dislocation, as well as the treatment of sprains and similar conditions, all categorized and organized by the head to the feet and the forms of instruments. (The author has organized their text into chapters, with this final chapter focusing on various medical procedures related to restoring bones and joints to their proper position, including treating dislocations and sprains, using a variety of tools and techniques.)
It is necessary for me to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of using cautery, as well as the conditions under which it should be avoided. (The author is explaining that they will provide information about the use of cauterization in medical procedures, including the advantages and potential risks, as well as situations where its use may be contraindicated.)
Therefore, I say that the discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of cautery is lengthy and complex, requiring knowledge and skill, and has been spoken about by many wise people with differing opinions. I will only briefly touch on this topic, to avoid being overly verbose. (The author acknowledges that there is a great deal of information and debate surrounding the use of cauterization in medical procedures, but they do not wish to delve too deeply into these matters, instead focusing on providing a concise overview.)
Therefore, I say that cautery is beneficial in most cases universally, whether the patient has a fever or not, with the exception of two conditions: those that are febrile and without a clear cause. (The author is discussing the use of cauterization in medical procedures, noting that it is generally helpful in most cases, but there are certain conditions where its use may be contraindicated.) [
In the case of a febrile and dry condition with a clear cause, there is disagreement among medical experts about whether cautery is beneficial or not. Some argue that it is helpful in this situation, while others disagree, stating that it is not appropriate to use heat to treat an illness that is already hot and dry in nature. This is because the nature of fire is also hot and dry, so using cautery would only exacerbate the underlying condition. (The author is discussing a specific case where there is disagreement among medical experts about whether cauterization should be used. They explain that some argue it is helpful, while others believe it is not appropriate due to the potential for making the patient's condition worse.)
And I say that those who argue the opposite, stating that cautery is not beneficial in febrile and dry conditions, are incorrect. In fact, cauterization can be helpful in treating any condition of heat and dryness that arises in the human body. This is because when compared to fire, the human body is cold and wet, so using cautery can help to balance these conditions and promote healing. (The author is arguing against those who believe that cauterization should not be used in cases of febrile or dry illnesses. They argue that heat can be helpful in restoring balance to the body, which may be out of equilibrium due to an underlying condition.)
And I say from my own experience, having observed this many times. (The author is adding weight to their argument by stating that they have personally observed the benefits of cauterization in medical practice. They are using their own experience as evidence to support their claims about the usefulness of heat in restoring balance to the body and promoting healing.)
But it is not necessary for those who are experienced and trained in the chapter on cautery to come to this conclusion through their own practice, as they have already learned about the diversity of human constitutions and the variety of illnesses that can arise in different individuals. They have also studied the causes of these conditions and the factors that can influence their severity and duration. (The author is acknowledging that those who are experienced and trained in medical practice may not need to rely on personal experience to understand the benefits of cauterization, as they have already learned about these matters through their education and training.)
But in other conditions, there is no need for fear on your part, especially in cases of cold and wet illnesses, as all doctors agree on this matter. They do not disagree about the benefits of using cautery in these situations. (The author is reassuring those who may be uncertain about the use of cauterization in medical procedures, stating that there is general agreement among medical experts about its usefulness in treating cold and wet conditions.)
And know, son, that the secret to healing with cautery using fire and the benefits of it, are only found in cautery combined with sharp medicine, because fire is simple, and its action does not reach beyond the member that is cauterized, but rather affects only the adjacent members with minimal harm. (The author is discussing the use of cauterization in medical procedures, noting that when used in combination with sharp medicine, it can be a powerful tool for healing. They explain that fire is a simple element, and its effects are limited to the area that is treated directly. This suggests that the use of cautery can be precise and controlled, allowing doctors to target specific areas of the body without causing widespread harm.)
The action of heating medicine reaches that part of the body that is numb and quickly brings about illness in the diseased member with difficult healing and easily assists.
Fire, due to its elevated nature and the goodness of its substance, does not do anything but expel superfluities. This is known to us through experience and long practice in the art, studying its true causes. And for this reason, I am excused from a lengthy discourse. If it were not prohibited in this modest book, I would reveal to you secretly, with the help of fire, the nature of its operation in bodies and its expulsion, which expels illnesses, explained with philosophical demonstrations, which would be useful for your understanding.
And know, sons, that they disagree on the timing of when it is appropriate to perform cauterization and recommend the best time to do so is in early spring.
And I say that cauterization is appropriate at any time, because the harm caused by inappropriate timing is outweighed by the benefits of cauterization. This is especially true if the cauterization is necessary for severe and acute pains that cannot be delayed, as they are feared to bring greater harm than the minor harm caused by performing cauterization at an inopportune time.
And do not forget this, my sons, only the ignorant people and foolish doctors think that cauterization is not always appropriate for all illnesses, but rather it should be applied when necessary.
And the reason for this is not as they believe, because cauterization is a substitute for medicine that alters the complexion and dries out the moisture, which are the cause of pain.
However, sometimes cauterization is performed unnecessarily due to the enthusiasm for its power and effectiveness, as well as the greatness of its reputation.
And it is possible that the illness may return at some point in time, depending on the complexion of the patient and the location of their illness, as well as their overall health, and what has accumulated in their body due to the aggregation of superfluidities and what they have consumed in food and drink that contributes to their illness. However, if the illness for which cauterization is performed is subtle and located in a part of the body with few superfluidities and moisture, as is the case with toothache or similar pains, it is possible that the pain will not return, but rather it will be reduced.
And the common saying is that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, and this is true, but not in the way I understand it, because I do not believe that there is any cure more effective than cauterization, whether through medication or other means.
And the reason for this is actually the opposite of what is commonly believed; the notion that cauterization is the last resort in medicine does not mean that it is only used when all other methods of treatment have failed, but rather it is often employed at the end of a cause after other medicines have been tried and proven ineffective. And so, from what has been said, it is clear that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, but not in the way that is commonly understood by laypeople and foolish doctors.
The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they did not say this without reason, but rather because of the equality of gold and the loftiness of its substance.
The ancients also said that the location of cauterization does not matter, but this is not entirely true, as I have proven and demonstrated through experience that it does make a difference in certain cases. Cauterization with gold is superior to cauterization with iron, just as they said, but when using fire with gold for cauterization, one must be careful because the gold heats up according to the amount of heat applied and its own properties, which can cause it to melt if too much heat is used. This can result in some layers of gold being burned away, causing problems for the practitioner who must then deal with the consequences of this error.
And so, when performing cauterization with iron, one should do it more gently and precisely in order to achieve the desired effect.
I have now organized this chapter on cauterization according to the relevant topics and have covered everything related to the head down to the feet, in order to make it easier for you to find what you are looking for.
The first chapter.
This type of cauterization treats both moisture and coldness in the affected area, which are caused by two factors: an abundance of phlegm and humoral congestion. The symptoms include headaches that extend from the head to the ears and eyes, excessive sleeping, toothaches, and migraines, as well as all other illnesses caused by coldness, such as paralysis, seizures, and apoplexy, among others.
The method of this cauterization is as follows: first, order the patient to be purged with laxative medicine, cleansing the head with a purgative for three or four nights, depending on the severity of their illness, their age, and their habits.
Then, instruct the patient to shave their head with a razor and have them sit on an inclined bench with their hands resting on their knees.
Then, place the edge of your palm over the bridge of their nose, between their eyes. However, once you have located the correct spot using your finger, mark it with ink and then heat the olive-shaped cautery tool, which should be shaped as follows:
Then, place the heated cautery tool on the marked spot and press down gently, gradually constricting the tissue as you rotate it.
Then, lift your hand gently and check the area to see if any bone has been exposed, such as the size of a grain of barley. If so, apply more pressure with the cautery tool until you can see the desired result. If the tool becomes cold, replace it with another heated one until the desired effect is achieved.
Then, take a small amount of salt and dissolve it over the area and leave it there for three days.
Then, apply a compress soaked in egg white to the area and leave it there until the burn scar has been destroyed. Then, treat the area with a four-ingredient ointment until it is healed.
And they also said that when a wound remains open, it heals better and is more beneficial, which is why it is preferable and more advantageous.
They also said that some people believe that the spine should be cauterized all the way to the bone and the cautery tool should be kept in place until a portion of the spinal cord has become attached to it.
Then, remove what is adhered to the bone and treat the area.
They also said that others believe that the cautery tool should be inserted all the way to the back, causing significant damage to the bone until it breaks. This is the method used by alchemists: And they believe that this location is where the vapors of the head escape.
And the wound should be kept open for an extended period of time and treated until it is fully healed and consolidated.
However, I do not recommend either of these two methods in all cases, but only in certain circumstances out of necessity. It is better, in my opinion, to leave the head intact whenever possible, as it is made vulnerable by the separation of its continuity, as we have seen in other parts of the body, particularly when the patient has a weak constitution.
And I believe that the first type of cauterization is safer and more beneficial, and this method should be used whenever possible to promote healing.
Chapter two.
"Of cauterization on the head."
When chronic and long-lasting pain occurs in the entire head of a patient who has been suffering for some time, and they have tried various treatments such as garlands, helmets, cataplasms (a medicated poultice or plaster), emollients, ointments, and other remedies without success, especially if they have already been cauterized with a cautery but it has not helped them at all, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution in its nature and is not frail, and if there is a large vein nearby. In that case, cauterize with another cautery, but only slightly. Then cauterize the area on top of the patient's head with an internal cautery while the vein is still open. Incise the vein (codena) and expose the bone to the amount that we have determined, then cauterize it with a cautery at the back of the head in the place called "vas," which is where a cupping glass (ventosa) is placed. And lift your hand in this way, and do not expose the bone, because the patient will experience a great deal of pain that is different from the pain caused by other cauteries on the head.
And I say that this cautery should be used in its proper place, because the type of cautery used to treat corns on the head and the occiput is more subtle than the one used to treat the middle of the head, and this is its form.
Chapter three.
On cauterization for non-acute migraines.
When pain occurs in the side of the head or is spread throughout the eye, it should be evacuated with purifying medicines for the head, and other treatment should be administered, which I have mentioned in the sections on diseases. And if that does not help, then cauterization can be performed in two ways: either with an acute burning medicine or with iron.
But a cautery with a burning medicine is when you take a piece of alum, and you scrape it and burn off the ends of it from both sides. And then make an incision in the location of the pain in the temple with a lanced lancet until it is made in the appropriate place below the vein, where it is hidden.
And then apply pressure to it with a tight bandage to stop the bleeding, and leave it in place for three hours; and then remove the alum and let the wound remain open for two or three days, and then place a poultice of crushed leaves soaked in vinegar on it until the area heals.
And then cure that with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, do that with some burning medicines that I have written in the two treatises on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this way: heat the cautery until it glows red, and then apply it to the affected area.
And it is called "key nails" because the head of it is similar to the shape of a key with some curvature, and in the middle part of it, there is a small prominence.
And then place it over the location of the pain and hold your hand there so that the tendons below are not damaged, and rotate the iron slowly with a steady motion.
And if the amount of tissue that is burned by the instrument matches the shape of the vein and its depth, then lift your hand slightly so that the tendons below are not damaged, to avoid causing excessive bleeding from an injured artery.
And then soak a piece of cloth in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it there for three days; then apply a poultice made with crushed leaves and vinegar, and then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of a scalpel according to the method I have described earlier, and be careful not to cut an artery in this non-acute migraine.
Chapter four.
On cauterization for acute migraines.
When you treat migraines with what we have said in the previous treatment, and in the sections on diseases, and if that treatment does not work, and sometimes because of the severity of the disease it is not enough to use the first method of cauterization with medicine or fire, then it is necessary to heat the scalpel cautery until it turns white, which means you should place it over the location of the pain with a line of length equal to the width of your finger or larger. Then lift your hand once and press down firmly so that you cut through the tendon and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful about the continuation of the jaw, which can be injured during chewing, and that the tendon is not burned and the nerves that move it are not damaged, and that there is no spasm.
And if it is about the protection and caution regarding bleeding from an artery that has been cut, then there is fear in cutting it, especially for those who do not know what they are doing and are not skilled or experienced; and leave the operation to someone else at the beginning.
I come to remind of the regulation of blood flow, an accident of arteries, in its own manner, in its place in this book.
And if you see that this illness cannot withstand this cautery and you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, then cauterize them in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and heal the wound while it is still fresh.
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on stretching of arteries with two knives, and this is a better and more effective form of cauterization.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5: On the cautery of ear pains.
When there is pain in the ear due to cold and it is treated with laxative methods and the other treatment that I mentioned in the division, but the pain remains, then use hot cautery, which is called "puncta," and it looks like this:
Then bring the cautery close to the fire and move it around the entire ear as if rolling it around, or in the area of each affected part if the pain is localized. Bring the cautery slowly to the ear, gradually heating it up until you have marked the spot with a probe.
And if you use the cautery of ten points on the entire ear, and place it there, then heal the areas while they are still fresh.
Chapter 6.
Chapter 6: On the Cautery of Swelling.
Swelling that is cured and does not require cautery, but rather the application of species that come out in pus, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cautery of the species that comes out in dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of swelling with horehound and caper spurge and guaiacum, and you don't find your treatment effective, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: the first should be at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temperature, and the third should be at the junction of two lips.
And place the cautery on the opposite side of the affected area, because softening does not occur unless it is applied to the healthy part.
The method of cauterization is to cauterize the area with the heated instrument at the highest point of the outer ear, slightly above the temple of the head, and then move it downward in temperature. The length of the instrument should be similar to the width of a finger. After that, place your hand with the heated instrument over the affected area until the amount of swelling has been reduced by the size of the tip of the instrument.
And this is the form of the cautery tool, which is specific to the cutler, and its shape is as follows: However, a more subtle tool is preferable, similar to what you see; and it is necessary that the knife be slightly thinner than usual.
And treat the area with what comes before the procedure until it has healed.
Chapter 7.
Chapter 7: On the Cautery of Ancient Apoplexy.
When apoplexy is ancient and you treat it with what we have said but do not find your medication effective, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries: one on each temple of their head; another in the middle of their forehead, as we have said; and another at the throat. The method of cauterization is done in the way that has been previously mentioned.
And they have already been cauterized above the mouth of the stomach, and it is more severe. Therefore, let it be treated with what comes next in the procedure.
Chapter 8.
Chapter 8: On the Cautery of Forgetfulness Made by Flame.
It is necessary to give the patient in the beginning large doses of herbs and pills that soften (them).
And then shave the entire head of the patient and apply a plaster of cedar, as described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply it several times, because this is the method of cautery. And do so in the same order as I have already said.
And so if they are cured well by this method, then do not proceed to the next step. But if not, then cauterize them with three burns on the back of their head, which should extend from the highest part of the head down to the base of the neck. And pause between each burn for the width of a finger, and then heal the cautery with what has been previously described.
But if you wish to add more and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize them in the middle of their forehead, and if you wish to add even more, then cauterize them above both temples.
And heal the burns until they are healed, using an olive-shaped cautery as previously described.
Chapter 9.
Chapter 9: On the Cautery of Paralysis and Softening of the Entire Body.
It is necessary that you proceed with the softening of the head using herbs and what we have said; and then shave the patient's head and cauterize them in the middle of their forehead, and above both temples, and on the back of their head, and with three burns on the vertebrae of their neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body, and the patients can tolerate it, and the condition is severe, then cauterize them with four burns on the vertebrae of the back, and specifically with a burn that is deeply penetrated by the tip of the tail, and raise your hand. And heal the burns until they are healed, using an olive-shaped cautery tool.
Chapter 10.
Chapter 10: On the Cautery of Epilepsy.
Epileptics should not be cauterized unless the epilepsy is caused by pus.
And so it is necessary to soften the brain of the patient at the beginning with herbs and the other treatment that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is severely ill and can tolerate the exception of medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate medication, then administer guaiacum and masticatory pills that soften, for several days, with an improvement in their diet.
And then shave the patient's head and cauterize them with one burn in the middle of their forehead, as previously described, and another burn on the back of their head, and above each temple. And if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize them with several burns as I have said, having a paralyzing effect and softening on the vertebrae of the neck and back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, as previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then use a subtle cautery in this way.
Chapter 11.
Chapter 11: On the Cautery of Melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt humidity and thick flame, then cauterize with the burns that we have mentioned in the case of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess that leads to melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give them to drink a substance that softens their brain, as has been described previously in the division.
And approach the patient's head, and make a well-made turban of it (the cloth) on the circle (head), and place it in the middle of the head.
And let the patient be sixty years old and held (supported) from all sides.
And apply a liniment; it is more worthy to use an ancient remedy of sheep (wool). And heat that (the liniment) over the fire for tempered warmth, which the patient finds comfortable when applied to them. And apply that (the liniment) in the middle of the patient's head on the circle (head), and let them rest with it until they are refreshed.
And do this with the patient once a week, along with other good treatments until they are healed; or if you wish, cauterize that by making small points according to its size (the affected area), as long as your hand is holding a cautery in the following manner: this is a type of cautery which moistens the brain with equality.
And apply that piece of meat soaked in broth or grain (flour) of woolen cloth.
Chapter XII.
On cauterization of descending water in the ear.
When you notice the beginning of water in the ear through the signs which I have mentioned earlier, then begin (the treatment) and give the patient something to drink that will cleanse their head and keep it free from all moisture.
And make them sweat in a bath for several days.
And command the patient to wash their head, and cauterize that in the middle of the head with a cautery; and also cauterize that on both temples if it is the beginning of fluid in both ears or at one temple if it is the beginning of fluid in one ear.
Incise with a hot iron all the veins and arteries that are under the scalp; and let the cauteries be in that area (at) a length in line with the temples.
And take care not to cause bleeding when cauterizing; and if you see any bleeding, stop it with some medicine that is available to you.
And I will come with knowledge in the extraction of arteries and in cutting out those (growths) and carefulness for bleeding.
And sometimes it is necessary to cauterize in the neck, below the two bones with two well-made cauteries.
Chapter XIII.
On cauterization of old tears (fluid-filled cysts).
When the tears (fluid-filled cysts) in the eyes are old and hardened and they flow through the veins and arteries that are visible on the outside of the head, and it has been confirmed that this is a superfluous fluid caused by excessive pressure, then cauterize that with the cautery that we have mentioned earlier in the chapter on water accumulating in the ears, using one cautery on the middle of the forehead, two on the temples, and two below the collarbones. And if it is necessary to add (more treatment), then cauterize that on all sides of the corner of the eye at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter XIV.
On cauterization of foul smells (bad breath) from the nose.
When you treat that with what we have mentioned in the division (of this book) and it is not effective, then prepare and give to the patient to drink the cochias for three nights; and approach the patient's head, and cauterize them with a medium-sized olive cautery. And also cauterize that with a nail-shaped cautery, using two on the eyebrows just below the hairline.
And be careful not to cut (or burn) the artery.
And here is the shape of the nail-shaped cautery (tool).
Chapter XV.
On cauterization for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye becomes soft due to illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with this round-shaped cautery tool, and here is its shape:
And if you wish, cauterize that on both eyebrows with two small cauteries in all areas, and make them long along the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the amount (size) of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery, but only until a third of the eyelid is burnt (or cauterized).
Chapter XVI.
On cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs (eyelashes) are turned inwards and touching the finger (or palm) of the hand.
When the hairs (eyelashes) of the eye are turned inward so that they prick the finger (or palm) of the hand, then cauterize those with two methods: for cauterizing can be done either by using heat or by using a burning medicine.
If you cauterize with fire (heat), then command the patient to read their prayers beforehand, as those who clean themselves (with holy water), until they are extended and purified; and if it pricks them during that time, then you should strengthen the eyes of the patient with a bandage so that it is not harmed while the hairs are growing back.
Once they have grown and been purified (or cleansed), then put the patient's head in your lap, and place a seal over the eyelids of the patient with an herbal compress (or poultice), using a sign that is shaped like the leaf of a myrtle tree, and let the beginning of the sign be near the lashes.
And also place (or put) a piece of meat soaked in egg white or powdered ptilon (or psyllium seed) on the eye.
And also heat (or warm) the cautery that has this shape:
And also cauterize (or burn) the figure that you have marked, bit by bit, in multiple sessions, until the surface of the skin has been burned and appears like a myrtle leaf, all looking proper and appropriate.
And the sign of health for this work is that you see the eyelid (or edge) of the eye already contracted and the lashes lifted toward the incision (or cut) in the eye.
And therefore lift your hand and leave that (cauterization) for three days, and also place (or apply) a piece of meat with broth over it until the scar is healed. And also cure (or treat) that with ointment until it is healed.
If the hair returns near the nostrils for some reason and the eyelid is swollen, then perform cautery again in the same way as you did before.
But if hair has grown on the lower eyelid, then cauterize the area that is raised to its natural location and cover it so that the hair does not irritate the eye.
But if you use a heated medical instrument to burn the hair so that it is removed and covered, then make a leaf-shaped piece of paper or cloth like that of myrtle.
Then take some recognized soap and a live coal, and mix them together. That is, mix the soap with the live coal. Do this quickly so that it does not cool down, and spread some of the mixture on the paper shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eye or both eyes; and place a small piece of egg white-soaked cotton under the eye, and let the patient's head be in your lap.
Then place your finger over the medicine and press it gently until the patient feels a slight sting from the medicine, for this sting is like that of fire.
And once you notice that the sting has stopped, then remove the medicine and wipe around it with your finger; once the sting has subsided, leave the medicine on for a while longer and rinse the eye with water; and then consider whether the swelling of the eyelid has gone down as much as it should be after being cauterized by heat or incision, for if so, then it is good; but if not, reapply the medicine to the area where it has not been applied and do not degrade your work until the treatment is complete and the eye is contracted.
Then place a piece of egg white over it until the pus from the abscess has been drained; and then treat it with an appropriate ointment or other remedy until it is healed.
And during your treatment, you must be vigilant and make sure that no residue of the medicine falls into the eye; if the eyelid remains swollen for several days or if hairs irritate the eye, then reapply the medicine to the area where the eyelid is still swollen, just as you did at the beginning, and continue to treat it until it is healed.
And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are different in size and smallness, and therefore the treatment should be adapted accordingly.
And it is not right to hide this method from those who study this art.
Chapter 17.
Chapter 17: On the Cautery of a Fistula in the Lacrimal Duct of the Eye.
When you treat a fistula as described in the sections on diseases and do not achieve success, then it is necessary for you to cauterize it in this way: tell the patient to place their head in your lap and have a minister hold their head between your hands in such a way that they are comfortable and not hurt or shaken by their movements. [
Then place a piece of egg white or a piece of bread soaked in milk over the eye.
And prepare the cautery, which should look like this:[Notes: I'm assuming that "igneys" is a typo and it should be "ignis," which means fire in Latin. The text seems to suggest that the author will now describe the shape of the cautery tool, but then it just says "cum lo malaute pot esser sanat," which means "by which the patient can be healed." So I'm assuming there's a missing sentence or two here.]
which should be concave, in the shape of a reed or vulture's feather, at the end that is used for cauterizing.
And if you wish, it can be sharpened to a point at the other end. And if you prefer, it can have a handle like a tent.[
But still, a concave shape is better for this kind of work.
Then press on the fistula if it is open, and remove any pus or dry it out. But if it is not open, then make an incision in it and extract the pus from it.
Then place the hot cautery over it and hold it there firmly but gently with your hand, keeping your hand away from the patient's eye and nose to avoid causing discomfort or injury; then move the cautery along the edges of the eye, destroying any infected tissue as you go.
And if at the beginning of your cauterization you penetrate into the bone, that is good; but if not, then reapply the cautery one or two more times if necessary, and leave it in place for three days; then cover it with a piece of egg white and apply a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine to the bone until it is exposed and scraped as necessary in its respective chapter. [
Here is another method of cauterizing a fistula that I mentioned earlier: locate the area of the fistula and open it up; then place a thin piece of molten lead (about an inch thick) over the opening in such a way that it does not harm the patient's eye. It is important to hold the lead in place with firm but gentle pressure, using a piece of cotton or cloth dipped in water or egg white to protect the eye from the hot metal. Lead has a remarkable ability to heal wounds and promote tissue regeneration, making it an ideal material for this kind of treatment. However, caution is necessary when using molten lead, as it can cause serious burns if not handled properly.
If the fistula has healed using the cautery and treatment methods described above, that is good; but if not, then it is necessary to perform a procedure called "trauc del nas" (which could be translated as "nasal trephination") in order to bring the fistula into the body of the nose, where it can be treated more effectively. This will be discussed further in its proper place later on.
Chapter 18.
Chapter 18: On the Cautery of Wounds from Pustules
It often happens that fissures occur in the lips, especially in children's lips.
And if your treatment of those fissures with the methods described earlier does not yield results, then you should use a small knife-shaped cautery tool in the following shape:[Notes: I'm assuming that "igneys" is a typo and it should be "ignis," which means fire in Latin. The text seems to suggest that the author will now describe the shape of the cautery tool, but then it just says "cum s’ensiec," which is a conjugation of the verb "ensenyar," meaning "to teach." So I'm assuming there's a missing sentence or two here.]
And let its concavity be similar to that of a knife blade. [
Then place the tip of the cautery carefully into the fissure until it reaches the base of the wound. [
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed. [
Chapter 19.
Chapter 19: On Cauterizing Fistulas in the Mouth
If an abscess develops in the area of the uvula, the roof of the mouth, or the gums around the teeth and it bursts open, becomes old, forms pus, and turns into a fistula, then if you treat this and your treatment is not effective, it is necessary to cauterize the fistula with an appropriate amount of heat, place the hot iron in the opening of the fistula, and hold it there with firm but gentle pressure until the heated metal touches the base of the wound; repeat this process one or two more times if necessary. Then treat the wound with appropriate ointments and dressings until it is healed.
And so if the sore has been cut and healed, it is good; otherwise, it is necessary to reveal the place, clean out the rotten bone as described in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
On the cauterization of teeth and the softening of stiffness.
When stiffness is softened by moisture and the teeth are decayed, then treat those with medicines and do not use fire, but rather place the patient's head in your lap, and bring the hot cautery near, shaped like this, so that you can quickly place the heated probe on the tooth and introduce it slightly into the cavity of the tooth, while keeping your hand a little distance from the flame so that the patient does not feel the full heat of the fire until the heat has reached the tooth.
And then lift your hand and reapply the cautery several times as needed.
And have the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it there for an hour, then spit it out, because the decayed tooth is now sealed and the softened gums are strengthened, and the corrupt moisture is dried up.
Chapter 21.
On the cauterization of tooth pain.
When tooth pain is caused by coldness or a worm in it, and does not respond to treatment with medicine, then cauterize the tooth in one of two ways: using a cow's horn cautery or using fire.
A cow's horn cautery is made by taking a cow's horn and heating it in a fire until it becomes soft, then shaping it into the form of a probe or other medical instrument. Once shaped, the horn should be wrapped in cloth at its base to protect the patient from burns, and then heated again before being quickly applied to the painful tooth until it becomes hot.
And then reapply the cautery several times, until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the teeth.
And if you prefer, soak a piece of wool or cloth in the hot cow's horn and place it on the painful tooth, and then place a red-hot iron over the cloth until the iron reaches the tip of the root of the tooth.
However, the cauterization with fire is that you should pay attention to the size of the probe or iron, and there should be some thickness in its core so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
And then heat the cautery to the desired shape, and place it on the tooth while keeping your hand over it until the cautery becomes hot. Repeat this procedure several times, as necessary, in order to reduce or eliminate the pain.
And it is important that after applying the cautery, the patient should fill their mouth with good broth and keep it there for an hour before spitting it out. This is the method of using the cautery.
And cauterize whichever end you are able to, according to your abilities.
And this is the shape of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
On the cauterization of umbilical hernias.
When umbilical hernias are caused by bile and cold humors, and do not respond to gentle massage with medicines, then you may cauterize the area as follows: shape the cautery like this, with two pointed ends so that smoke can escape from both sides of the instrument. Place the hot end of the cautery on the hernia once, and repeat if necessary until the heat reaches the core of the abscess.
And if the hernia is small, then cauterize it according to its size, and leave it alone for three days, applying a cloth soaked in broth over it until the burn has healed.
And then treat the burn with ointment and bandages until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
On the cauterization of hoarseness of voice and constriction of the windpipe.
When humors collect in the throat and particularly when this is accompanied by coldness of complexion, then it is important that the patient be purged at the outset with laxative medicines. Afterwards, cauterize the area at the base of the throat in the depressed location.
And be careful not to reach the windpipe with the cautery, and do not burn the cartilage of the throat more than a little.
And then cauterize the area with another instrument at the joint of the neck, at the last vertebra of the spine. And let the cautery be shaped like a nail, as described previously.
And then treat the area with what has been described previously until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
On the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humors, and the patient has no fever or tuberculosis and is suffering from a chronic condition, then you should cauterize the area with two cauteries on the collarbone in the depressed locations between the ribs and breastbone; and with another instrument at the midpoint of the chest between the two nipples. And let the cauteries be shaped like nails, as described previously.
And if you wish, make your cauterization punctate using the cautery known as "puncta," whose shape is described in the section on earache.
And make holes in those [cauteries] and then treat the area with what has been described previously until it is healed.
And let the cauteries have three prongs, so that you can make three cauterizations at once with it, like this:
Chapter 25.
On the cauterization of itchiness, which is the head of the penis.
When the head of the penis is dislocated due to excessive lubricity and does not return to its normal position during an erection, then you should reduce the dislocation by gently manipulating the area until it returns to its normal position. And if the patient is lying on their back or side, then raise the lower part of the body using your left hand, while supporting the dislocated joint with your right hand, as described previously.
And apply the cautery having two tips; and this is its shape:
And apply the cautery to the knee, penetrating one side to the other, and the shape of the cauterization will then be like the letter Y made by four cautery tips.
And sometimes it is appropriate to adjust according to this count, and that is why there are eight cautery tips.
And place a piece of porous clay with salt on the cautery, and have the patient lie still to ensure tranquility, and keep the limb immobile for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and treated late, then cauterize over the muscle with a spike-shaped cautery or with several pointed cautery tips, for the joint will be strengthened, moisture will be dispelled, and the patient will be healed.
Chapter 26.
On cauterization of the stomach.
When excessive cold and dampness enter the stomach and multiply there, causing harm to its function, if you continue with conventional treatments without success, then it is necessary to have the patient turn onto their back, extend their arms and legs, and cauterize the area with three cautery tips: one below the left side of the abdomen for a finger's breadth using a spike-shaped cautery, and two triangular-shaped cauteries below each side of the first cautery, ensuring that they do not touch and will create scabs. [Note: The text suggests that this will help restore balance to the stomach and improve its function.]
And if the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds the thickness of a finger's width. [Note: This appears to be a continuation of the previous passage, providing further instructions on the depth of cauterization.]
And the shape of the cautery should be as follows, with an additional piece: If you wish, cauterize in the middle of the stomach using a large cautery shaped like this; and let this be a cautery shaped like a circle, like this:[Note: The text includes simple drawings to illustrate the shapes of the cauteries. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide visual aids here.]
And the stomach should be cauterized with small pointed cauteries for those who are afraid of the larger one: and that is, place the cautery on the stomach according to the size you desire, and then cauterize in the desired spots; and treat the area with the usual care until it is healed. [Note: This passage provides an alternative option for those who may be fearful of the larger cautery recommended earlier.]
Chapter 27.
On cauterization of the cold liver. [Note: The term "fietge fret" is not a common medical term in modern English, but it appears to refer to a condition where the liver is cold or affected by an excess of cold and damp humors.]
When pain arises in the liver due to coldness or dampness or excessive gas that disrupts its normal function and causes superfluous egression, and if conventional treatments do not bring relief, then it is necessary for the patient to lie on their back with their head raised, and place three cauteries of a specific size and shape as follows on the liver below the hypochondriac region, where the liver is located. [Note: The text includes a simple drawing to illustrate the placement and shape of the cauteries.]
And let the space between each cautery be the width of a finger, and let the cauteries be as long as the straight line of the body. [Note: This passage provides further details on the placement and size of the cauteries.]
And do not apply too much pressure with the cautery. [Note: This appears to be a continuation of the previous passage, emphasizing the importance of careful and controlled application of the cautery.]
And let the amount of cauterization be equal to half the width of a finger, and not more; and if the patient is standing, let them stand on their feet; and if they are unable to stand, then let them lie down with their limbs extended and arms raised. [Note: This passage provides further instructions on the depth and positioning of the cauterization.]
And it is possible for you to cauterize with these cauteries using a knife-shaped cautery, if you have skill and prudence in the art. [Note: This passage suggests that there are different types of cauteries available, including one shaped like a knife, which may be used for specific purposes.]
And be careful not to overdo the cauterization, and ensure that the entire width of the finger is cauterized so as to reach all parts of the body and enter the intestines, for the liver here is delicate; and take note of this. [Note: This passage emphasizes the importance of thorough and controlled cauterization, while also warning against overdoing it, in order to achieve optimal results.]
Chapter 28.
On puncturing a liver abscess with a cautery. [Note: The term "apostema" refers to an abscess or collection of pus in the body.]
When a growth or abscess forms in the liver and you want to know if it is located in the liver tissue or the lining, then if it is in the liver tissue, the patient will experience heaviness and increased pain. [Note: This passage describes a method for determining the location of an abscess within the liver based on the symptoms experienced by the patient.]
And if it is located in the lining of the liver, then the pain will be severe and may exhaust even experienced doctors in its treatment. [Note: This passage continues the previous one, describing a second potential location for an abscess within the liver and emphasizing the severity of symptoms associated with this location.]
Therefore, it is necessary for the patient to lie on their back with their head raised; and then locate the site of the abscess using your fingers; and then apply the cautery in the shape of a saw, which has been previously described on the previous page. [Note: This passage provides further instructions for treating an abscess within the liver based on its location, suggesting the use of a specialized cautery tool to puncture and drain the abscess.] And cauterize with that saw-shaped cautery until the entire liver is compressed and the abscess has been penetrated, until it begins to heal and scab over. [Note: This passage continues the previous one, providing further instructions for using the specialized cautery tool to puncture and drain the abscess.]
And treat the area with the usual care used for other abscesses until it has healed. [Note: This passage emphasizes the importance of proper aftercare in treating an abscess within the liver, suggesting that similar methods be used to treat other types of abscesses as well.]
And it is not necessary to use this type of cautery unless you have extensive training in the art of medicine and have treated many illnesses; but even with some experience, be cautious in performing this operation, leaving a small amount of space, which is better. [Note: This passage emphasizes the importance of proper training and experience in using specialized medical tools like the saw-shaped cautery described earlier, while also suggesting that it may be safer to leave a small amount of space when puncturing an abscess within the liver.]
Chapter 29. [newline] De cauterizacio del cor.
On Cauterization of Pleurisy
The ancients used to cauterize pleurisy with the red-hot iron of aristaology in this manner: take a long, dry piece of iron from the red-hot coals of aristaology, and select one that is slender and pointed at the end, about the width of a finger.
And then submerge that in oil and heat it over the fire, and then cauterize with a cautery in the area between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the jawline, one slightly turned towards the area below the chin, and two more on the side of the body between the fifth rib and the spine, turning slightly towards the back; and another one in the middle of the chest; and another on the stomach; and three on the back; and one in the area between the shoulder blades, and two more on either side of the back below the cautery between the shoulders.
And it is not necessary to press hard with the cautery, but rather work gently and carefully on the surface of the skin.
And the ancients also said that some men use a cautery made of iron in the shape of a ray and apply it to the affected area between the ribs until the pus is expelled, just as we described for liver abscesses.
But in this procedure with cautery, there is always danger, for one may die or suffer serious injury if the cauterization is applied to a fistulous tract that has not healed properly.
Chapter 30
On the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen with what has been said about the treatment in the division (of the abdomen), and do not refrain from your treatment, then cauterize it (the spleen) in three ways, all of which are correct: one is to make three or four burns (cauterizations) according to the length of the spleen, according to the shape of the liver's cauteries, the shape of which has been described before.
And let there be between each cautery the width of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as that described for cauterizing the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the patient be on their back.
And there is another way of cauterizing, which is to heat the cautery with two wicks, which we have mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the muscle, and lift up the diaphragm which is in front of the spleen where it lies on the left side of the patient.
And let your lifting (of the diaphragm) be according to the length of the body, so that burns can be made according to the width of the body.
And then insert the two wicks, light them, in that space where with those you penetrate the diaphragm from the other side.
And then extract the cautery; and so four burns are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three wicks.
And you should take care of the cautery so that it does not become too cold, for this is more conducive to healing than the previous causes mentioned in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
On the cauterization of hydropic patients (edematous or dropsical patients).
Do not cauterize in hydropic patients, except in certain cases.
When you treat the hydropic patient with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division (of the abdomen) and do not refrain from your treatment, then it is necessary to cauterize in four places around the navel, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two between the vertebrae of the back, and one on the right side of the chest, and one again on the stomach. And let the depth of the cautery be appropriate to the thickness of the skin.
And let the cautery remain in place until it has cooled down completely.
And do not evacuate the patient during the treatment near the cautery, because it is necessary to add two intentions (to hasten healing), and the cure should be facilitated with help.
The shape of the cautery used to burn the abdomen should be spike-shaped, as described before, and the shape of the cautery used to burn the back should be olive-shaped, as described previously.
Chapter 32.
On the cauterization of feet and thighs.
When the feet are swollen and filled with stagnant water in cases of hydropsy, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the back of the foot between the auricular (outer ankle) and the anular (inner ankle), raising the hand with the cautery and not twisting it, and also lifting the skin without returning it completely, because stagnant water will exude.
The cautery should be shaped as follows: and make two burns on each thigh, and on each thigh let there be a burn made with the tip of the scalpel-shaped cautery. And let the cauteries be according to the length of the thigh, one below the knee and the other in the middle of the thigh, and two burns on each thigh.
And let the wound remain open without treatment for a long time, so that some water can drain from it.
And treat with the causes that we have mentioned.
Chapter 33. [-------------------------------------
On the cauterization of abdominal pain.
When the abdomen is swollen due to an accumulation of humors that weaken digestive and retentive functions (located in the stomach and intestines), then it is treated with the methods previously described, but without refraining from treatment. And sometimes the patient can tolerate a strong cauterization that expels the humors, in which case use a large cautery on their stomach as was previously described for cauterizing the stomach, along with a circular cautery and four fine burns around the navel, also fine, and a spike-shaped cautery or two. Additionally, apply an olive-shaped cautery to the alcatin (a part of the liver) over a large abscess, or use two such cauteries.
And sometimes when the humors are expelled and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize on the epigastrium (upper abdomen) and intestines, and gently apply two burns to the stomach and near the inguinal area. This is a perfect cure, and you will not err in providing such assistance.
Chapter 34.
On the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When hemorrhoids are of a gross nature or due to corrupt humors, and they have been treated according to the methods previously described but the treatment is not effective, then cauterize with three burns below the small triangular spine at the base of the spine, and with one burn above the navel, which should be made in two places.
And if you suspect that his stomach is chilled and his food not digested, and his face appears pustular, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery as described before; and with one cautery on the spleen, and with another cautery on the liver of him with a spike-shaped cautery, and leave the cauteries on for some time, and take care that it heals internally.
Chapter 35.
On the cauterization of abscesses near the groin.
When you lance an abscess, then heat the cautery which is shaped like an arrow. Then insert that heated cautery into the lanced abscess and direct your hand so that the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do that once or twice, because if there are many abscesses, then cauterize each of them as we have described, and take care of them with dressings until they heal.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on some areas, it is more beneficial.
Chapter 36.
On the cauterization of fistulas that are formed in the nature near the buttocks.
When nature does not obey the treatment that we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by this, then heal him with a cautery.
Therefore, when you see a fistula in the nature near the buttocks, and it is old and corrupt matter such as pus and putrefied moisture comes out of it, then it is more fitting to proceed with gentle care and estimate the quantity of its depth with the previously mentioned probe.
Heat the cautery which is shaped like an arrow. And then insert that heated cautery into this fistula, according to the depth estimated by the probe.
And move the cautery over that area until the corrupt flesh is burned away, one time or two or three times, according to your need.
And be careful not to cause burns to nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes to the bladder or the intestines, then be careful of all those areas; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy area and you think it is not penetrating.
And take care of that area until it heals.
And if the area is sealed and the matter has been lanced from it and remains so for a long time, then you know that it is completely healed.
And if the matter is not released from it, then you know that it is penetrating or in a bone abscess, or this is caused by one of those causes which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter 37.
On the cauterization of tumors.
When tumors cause pain due to pressure or swelling, and as a result the patient's limb is swollen, then it is necessary to cauterize each of those tumors with a pointed cautery, the memory of which we have mentioned before.
And lightly cauterize with the second one a little at a time, so that three linear cauteries will result, and they will be more beneficial.
Chapter 38.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When there is weakness and softening in the bladder due to pressure and moisture such that the patient cannot retain their urine, then cauterize that area in the lower part near the bladder where the skin of the pubic bone begins, with a cautery on both sides of it.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the opening of the wound; and cauterize with a cautery in the lower part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be spike-shaped as described before.
Chapter 39.
Of cauterization of the vein. (My guess is that "mayra" refers to a specific vein, but I couldn't find a clear equivalent in modern anatomical terminology)
When moisture and humidity come into the vein (mayra), and because of this conception is forbidden, and menstruation is corrupted, and the onset of menstruation is delayed, and pain occurs upon their arrival, then it is necessary that the area be cauterized with three cauteries along the circuit of the navel, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder; and with a single cautery on the spot just below the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cauteries be pointed.
Chapter 40. (The numbering of chapters varies between different editions and versions of medieval medical texts)
Of cauterization for the dislocation of the ankle.
When humidity and swelling have infiltrated the area of the ankle, causing it to become dislocated from its place, a sign of which is that one thigh appears longer than the other when compared to each other. And the location of the dislocation can be found in the joint. (I'm assuming "boyt" refers to the place where two bones meet, i.e. a joint)
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the ankle joint with a circular cautery, such that you have marked the circumference of the area with a probe; and in order for the joint to fall in the middle of the circle.
And let the shape of the cautery be the same as that described in the cauterization of the stomach. (I'm assuming this refers to a specific type or shape of cautery, which was previously described)
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize the area with three large olive-shaped cauteries instead. (I'm assuming "cauteri olivar gran" refers to a specific type of cautery that resembles an olive in shape)
And let the cauteries be made according to the thickness of the entire thigh; and take care that it heals properly. (I'm assuming "ispicitut" refers to the thickness or girth of the thigh)
Chapter 41. (The numbering of chapters varies between different editions and versions of medieval medical texts)
Of cauterization for the sciatic vein.
When pain occurs in the ankle joint, and it is caused by cold and moisture, then the patient should be treated with methods previously described, but if those do not work, and the condition has become chronic, then the patient should be bled of thick humors using fetid pills or artificial pills; and then cauterize the area. (I'm assuming "pillulas artificials" refers to some type of medication or substance that was prepared specifically for medical use)
And the method of cauterization in this case is done in two ways: either with a caustic substance or with fire. (I'm assuming "cauteri am medicinas comburentz" refers to a type of cautery that uses a chemical agent or substance to burn the skin)
Perform the cauterization in two ways, one of which is to place three triangular-shaped cauteries on the ankle joint, according to this shape, and make sure that they are deeply embedded. (I couldn't find a clear equivalent for "cauteri triangulatz" in modern medical terminology, but it could refer to a specific type or shape of cautery) And let the spaces between each cautery be the width of a finger, and if the cauteries are olive-shaped or large. (I'm assuming "cauteri olivar" refers to a specific type of cautery that resembles an olive in shape)
However, some may choose to place the cauteries on either side of the middle of the joint, so that there are four cauteries in total. (I'm assuming "cap de l’anquan" refers to the top or highest point of the ankle joint)
And if you prefer, you can use a circular cautery, the shape of which was previously described in the treatment for ankle dislocation; ensure that it is large enough to encompass the entire thigh and burn deeply. (I'm assuming "ispicitut" refers to the thickness or girth of the thigh)
This is the method for cauterization in sciatica when pain is localized to the ankle and does not extend further into the thigh.
However, if the pain extends into the thigh, then you should use two cauteries on the thigh at the location of the pain; and one cautery on the calf, slightly below the knee. (I'm assuming "cavilha" refers to the lower leg or calf)
And if a knife-shaped cautery is used, then its depth should correspond to the thickness of the thigh. (I'm assuming "cauteri cutellar" refers to a specific type of cautery that resembles a knife in shape)
And if the patient reports that the pain extends to the areas near the toes, then you should use a pointed cautery in those locations, with three or four or more points as necessary. (I'm assuming "cauteri per tres puntz" refers to a specific type of cautery that has three sharp points)
And if the patient reports pain below the knee and above the thigh, then use a knife-shaped cautery in that location. (I'm assuming "cauteri cutellar" refers to a specific type of cautery that resembles a knife in shape)
And be careful in all cauterizations not to burn the nerves or major blood vessels, as doing so could cause further harm or injury to the patient. (I'm assuming "gran arceria" refers to a large blood vessel)
And I have seen some who in their enthusiasm for cauterization burned the calf too deeply, causing the leg to become swollen and infected; this resulted in a large ulcer that spread to the entire foot. (I'm assuming "foc perforat" refers to a deep wound or ulcer) And this often leads to severe abdominal pain, and in some cases even death. (I'm assuming "accidic fort solucio de ventre" refers to a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain)
And if the pain is located in two joints simultaneously, then cauterize each one according to this method. (I'm assuming "dos partidas" refers to two separate locations or joints)
And the wise men have said that in cauterizing the ankle, this is the method to use: make a circular iron cautery with a circumference similar to that of a hand span; and its orifices should be the width of a date seed, or slightly smaller. (I'm assuming "alcus" refers to physicians or medical experts)
Inside that circle, there should be another third of the circumference; and the spaces between them should be equal to the width of a finger's breadth; and these circles should be open on both sides; and their length should be one or two fingers' breadth, and make sure that the edges of the iron are smooth and evenly spaced in the circles. (I'm assuming "notz" refers to the width of a finger) [Continued:]
And when it has been heated in the fire until it glows red and emits sparks, then place it over the ankle joint; have the patient lie down with their leg extended on a support. (I'm assuming "latz" refers to a type of support or cushion) And then cauterize the area with three circular cauteries in one application.
And then leave it in place for three days, then apply a poultice to the area with bread and leave the wound open for several days; and take care of it with ointments until it heals. (I'm assuming "boder" refers to some type of medicinal substance that is applied as a poultice)
Albucasis said: "My son, we have rarely used this type of cautery due to its frightening appearance, and also because few have been found who are skilled in using it properly." (I'm assuming "Albucasis" refers to Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn Abbas Al-Zahrawi, a famous Arab physician and surgeon)
But of all the cauteries that are tolerable, this one is best suited to the location where it is needed.
However, a cautery made with adhesive substances is preferable; make two circles with perforated edges, through which the handle of an iron door can be inserted; the length of the walls should be the width of two fingers or slightly less. (I'm assuming "armula" refers to some type of handle or grip) [Continued:]
And if the spaces between each of them are equal to the width of a finger, and they are open on both sides, and fit snugly together in this shape:
And then place it over the ankle joint while the patient lies down with their leg extended on a support; and apply pressure to the area with your hand. Take some hot water and pour it between the two circles, gradually increasing its heat until the patient can tolerate it for one hour. The cautery will cause a biting or stinging sensation similar to that of fire, but this should subside over time as the cauterization takes effect. (I'm assuming "aygua cauda" refers to hot water)
And then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe away the hot water from the entire ankle using cool water. (I'm assuming "instrument" refers to the cautery)
And then leave it in place for three days and apply a poultice to the area until the bruising and discoloration have faded. This is the final step in treatment. (I'm assuming "boder" refers to some type of medicinal substance that is applied as a poultice)
And then take care of it with ointments until it heals completely. (I'm assuming "enguentz" refers to some type of medical ointment)
And if the pain extends into the thigh or groin, perform a similar procedure as for the ankle, using a container that can hold water, in the same manner. (I'm assuming "estatua" refers to some type of medical device or instrument)
This is the method for using hot water, which I have already described in the treatise on the preparation of medicines. (I'm assuming "aygua cauda" refers to hot water) Here is a recipe for alkali and nitre mixed in equal parts, ground and then placed in a new bowl with one side pierced with a small hole the size of a needle prick, large enough to allow a single ray of light to pass through. (I'm assuming "alcali" refers to potassium hydroxide or lye, and "amdos ana" refers to nitre) [Continued:]
And place the container on top of another bowl filled with warm water, and then pour cold water over the alkali and nitre mixture until it reaches the level of your finger; then press down firmly with a clean cloth to absorb any excess liquid, allowing only a small amount of sharp water to drip from the bottom of the container into the bowl below. (I'm assuming "tieua ma" refers to a clean cloth) [Continued:]
And then add more water and pour it over fresh nitre and alkali; this will create a strong acidity that can be used in many medical procedures and for cauterizing other parts of the body, as it is a heating agent. (I'm assuming "caus viva" refers to nitre)
And some of the medicines used for wide-ranging cauterization include: zinc oxide, lead acetate, and beeswax mixed together. (I'm assuming "tezizic" refers to zinc oxide, "mel anacrat" refers to lead acetate, and "caus am sabo" refers to beeswax)
Galen reported the operation and cure used by an ancient physician to treat pain in the ankle and sciatica, saying that it was very effective and did not require any other treatment. He said that the patient was cured with a single application of this method, just as he described; and soon after, the pain disappeared completely. (I'm assuming "Gualia" refers to Galen, a famous Greek physician)
The remedy is made from green clay, and if it cannot be found, fresh figs can be used instead; they should be ground into a fine powder with a little salt and applied to the ankle joint or thigh where the pain is located, then bandaged in place. (I'm assuming "certarragi vert" refers to green clay) [Continued:]
And leave it in place for three hours or until the patient can no longer tolerate the discomfort caused by the poultice. (I'm assuming "cedacio" refers to some type of pain or discomfort)
And then place the poultice in warm water until the body of the patient turns red; then expose it to sunlight, as this will stop the pain and promote healing. (I'm assuming "entromet" means to expose or place)
And know that it is not appropriate for anyone to use cautery with these medicines unless it is to facilitate the evacuation of the body.
But Hippocrates says that when the stretched vein is cauterized after cutting it with a goat's fennel, it will benefit the person; and the cautery should be applied in this manner: wool should be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed between the toes of the foot and between the heel.
Then take a dry goat's fennel and heat it over fire until it becomes charcoal; then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is stretched out. Then repeat this, and do not stop doing so until the feeling of the bite reaches the groin and relieves the pain.
And this method of cautery is called cautery of cows.
Chapter 42.
On the cauterization of toothache.
Sometimes pain occurs in the teeth for various reasons, such as injury or piercing, or excessive evacuation, and for causes similar to these, due to the infusion of wet and cold matter.
And cautery should not be used except in this one case, which is caused by the effusion of cold and wet matter.
Therefore, it is appropriate to facilitate the evacuation of the patient with purgative pills and similar remedies that are applied to the tooth where the pain is located, in three lines according to its length, using a tent as a sign on each line; then cauterize or more, depending on the tolerance and strength of the patient.
And make the cauterization with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a middle clavicle cautery in this manner:

On the cauterization at the beginning of hives. [starts new topic]
This illness often affects small children; and the sign of its onset in children is that they have difficulty standing, lifting, and moving their legs.

And you will find it in the lower spine and the knots of it that are beginning to rise above the other vertebrae.
And when you see this and wish to prevent it, then cauterize with a circular cautery in this manner: that the cautery covers the entire surface of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize along the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two or three lines. And let the points be close to each other.
Then heal the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But be careful not to administer cautery in hives that are caused by nerve spasm.

On the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors. [starts new topic][translation]  E aprop quando tu veus que dolor ven en le pe e tinga la aparencia de podragua, pren cauteri segon aquesta forma:
And therefore, when gout caused by cold has been cured with the method of treatment and the pain is not renewed, then you should cauterize the remaining pain.
And it is when you cauterize for the purpose of evacuation along the circumference of the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let the cautery be an olive-shaped one, and this is its shape: [image description] The image shows an olive-shaped cautery, with a rounded tip and a curved body. It is a tool used in medical procedures to cauterize or burn tissue, often for hemostatic purposes.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise into the toes or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize each one with three or four cauteries on all sides with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize with them and do not press too hard with the cautery beforehand, but only slightly around the shape of the kidney.
And if the pains rise into the toe and the back, then administer the cautery as we have said in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called sugar, then puncture along the circumference of the fingers as they turn, puncturing in two lines. [translation]  E si las dolors so en las mas tant solament, e es apelada suagra, lahoras puncta en le circuit dels focils ayssi cum se revolvo, puncta en aquels dos linhas.
And if pain remains in the aforementioned (joints), then puncture (make a small cut) along the circumference of the joint, on every night and on the thumb of the hand.
And if pain spreads after several days to the calves or muscles, then cauterize each of them from all sides with assistance (from an instrument).
And do not evacuate the patient with good care and reception of medicines, because if good care is taken and inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, they will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
Of cauterization for ruptures (fractures).
When a rupture occurs in the groin and intestines protrude before the hernia at the genitals, and it begins to swell, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to refrain from eating on their designated day and to use lenient remedies so that the wound (fenda) heals on their belly.
Then place your hands on the patient's lower back and command them to hold their belly in so that the hernia or intestines do not protrude through the wound.
Then return the (intestines) to their place with your fingers using the technique and incision at the rupture, probing the injury along the bone of the pelvis, with a mark at the end that resembles the shape of a circle at the upper part of the body.
Then heat the cautery, which has this shape:
Until it becomes red and emits sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under them, and another servant is on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, holding it steady, and aim it so that you can reach the bone of the pelvis in the middle of the wound; and repeat this process if you have not succeeded in reaching the bone in the first attempt.
And carefully observe the condition of the intestines during your cauterization, and do not burn them so that the patient does not come to harm or suffer from further complications.
And know that when you use the cautery and do not reach the bone, do not consider your operation to be successful.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be fine according to their size and age.
And take care of the location of the cautery for three days with a poultice until the scar from the burn has healed.
And then cure that one among the other wounds that has healed.
And let the patient lie on his back for 40 days until the wound and the infection are sealed.
And it is necessary to provide nourishment for the patient according to the length of time needed for their cure, which will prevent the swelling of their stomach and ensure that their intestines do not come out due to the effort of healing.
And when you wish to get up after 40 days, gradually increase physical activity and maintain this for another 40 days.
And reduce work, overeating and drinking, and loud speaking, because when one follows this regimen of complete healing, they will be healed.
I will now discuss the cure for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, and at the beginning, it is necessary to continuously cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, using the pus from the abscess as fuel; and then cure that one (the rupture) as we have said, but if it is not appropriate.
And I have already mentioned that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in the following shape, as indicated by this illustration.
And a line is drawn along the length at the side above the rupture, and another line above it; then place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is more gentle and better.
Chapter 46.
Chapter 46: On the Cauterization of Tumors
When pain occurs in certain limbs due to injury or persistent inflammation and does not respond to medical treatment, it is necessary to use a pointed cautery for cauterization.
And let the cauteries be adapted to the size and smallness of each member, as well as its strength and weakness, location of the tumor and pain in it.
Therefore, if the patient is healed by the first cautery, that is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery over the affected area, because these pains are usually treated by applying a pointed cautery to the member nearest the painful area. It is necessary to continue with this treatment until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
Chapter 47: On the Cauterization of Leprosy
Some cases of leprosy have been cured with cautery to great benefit, but this is only effective if the type of leprosy is caused by an imbalance of black bile and phlegm.
And so when you wish to cauterize the leprosy, consider whether it is spreading and cure it with what we have said in the division (i.e., the previous chapter) and do not delay or abstain, and be concerned for the patient that the corruption may spread throughout their body and entire complexion. Therefore, cauterize the area above the neck with two cauteries: one at the middle of the forehead, and the second below it near the eyebrows, even reaching the hairline; and two on either side near the ears and over the temples; and one at the back, on the nape of the neck or behind the ear.
And lastly, place your hand with the cautery a little way in until it leaves a small impression on the bone and removes any scabs, in order to relieve the expiration of thick vapors from it. And then cauterize over the spleen as necessary.
And if the leprosy has spread over the patient and is visible, then you should cauterize it with the following cauteries that we have mentioned on the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on each of the eyelids, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large cautery near the kidneys, and one on each rib, and with two cauteries on each hip, and one on each side of each hip, and with two on each knee, and one on each side of each knee, and with two on each elbow, and one on each side of each elbow, and with two on each shoulder blade, and two on the muscles, and two on the tendons of their feet. And cauterize it on all of the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of their feet, and on the knuckles of their hands.
And be careful not to burn the nerves which are located above the heel, as these should not be burned.
And sometimes leprosy has been cured with a single cautery on the bone of the pelvis and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more beneficial and effective it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery as they do from their own, because their body is already numb or stupefied.
And it is necessary for the cauteries to be large or small according to the members and joints, as is specified by the types of instruments used.
And then cure the cautery with powdered herbs mixed with honey and the other cure until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Chapter 48: On the Cauterization of Stupor
When a limb is benumbed or asleep and is cured with medicines, oils, and plasters, but is not healed, then you should cauterize the numbed limb with cauteries according to its size or smallness.
And let your cautery enter a little into the thickness of the skin. And then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes stupor of the hands and feet, and of the vertebrae of the back, and near the base of nerves which cause numbness in that limb, has been cured with cautery, and then the stupor is relieved.
But do not presume this without the knowledge of a wise person in the anatomy of members and the exits of nerves throughout the moving body.
Chapter 49.
Chapter 49: On the Cauterization of Keloids (Morphea)
When a keloid is old and does not respond to any of the medicinal ointments, then you should cauterize it with a penetrating cautery slightly according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness and color of it has faded and its color has changed.
And then cure it with powdered herbs and lentils mixed with rose oil and leaves of arnica, and with dove's blood or hen's blood, each part in equal amounts and all mixed together, and then a bandage should be soaked in this mixture and applied to the area until it is healed.
Chapter 1
On the Cauterization of Cancer
When cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery along the circumference of it, as shown.
And the wise men said that it should be cauterized with the rear cautery in the middle location; but I have not seen that done, because I fear that it may become ulcerated, and I have indeed seen such cases before.
And it is more appropriate to cauterize around the edge of it with a circular cautery, as we have said, or even with multiple cauteries.
Chapter 2
On the Cauterization of Swellings
When any swelling is slow in maturation, and this occurs due to excess fluids accumulating, or because of the patient's condition, as they are old and weak, with little blood, or due to the passage of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the swelling; then cauterize around its edge with multiple small punctate cauteries, and leave it alone so that it can mature on its own.
But if you wish to perforate it with the cautery, then heat the cautery to this shape: and place it in the middle of the swelling until the puncture penetrates deep into it.
And if you place the cautery in that location which is lower down, to relieve the limb or body part; and then care for it until it heals completely.
Chapter 3
On the Cauterization of Corroding Ulcers
A corroding ulcer is a wandering corruption in the limb, which corrodes it in the same way that fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you see the corroding ulcer in a location where it is not possible to use fire for cauterization, then heat multiple small or large cauteries as appropriate for that location where the corrosion has occurred.
And then cauterize all around it until you eradicate all the corruption, leaving behind no cause for further harm.
And then leave it alone for three days and apply oil mixed with crushed herbs over the cauterized areas until all scabs are eradicated and all corruption has been removed.
And then care for it with flesh-generating ointments.
But if after three days you see that the flesh has healed completely in areas without corruption, then that is good; but if not, then you should repeat the cautery on the rough areas of the corrupted locations.
And a corroding ulcer is treated with acrid medicine at times, as it serves the same purpose as cautery. But nevertheless, cautery with fire provides more rapid relief.
And I have already mentioned that the treatment with acrid medicine is used in division, and so you should use it when necessary.
Chapter 73
On the Cauterization of Nails and Similar Conditions
Many patients suffer from a condition called "claw" in the lower parts of their diseased feet, which is a large opening that causes deformity and turns the foot; there are two methods for cauterization in such cases, namely cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
But cautery with fire is done by heating the concave-shaped cautery that resembles a vulture's beak, which should be made of iron according to the size required to encompass the entire nail from all sides, and have fine edges.
And then you should place the heated cautery over the nail and rotate your hand with the cautery along the circumference of the nail until it reaches the depth of the nail. And leave it alone for three days until pus begins to flow from it. And then apply an ointment of crushed mallow with salt to it and leave it on for one night, as this will help eradicate the root cause of the problem.
And treat the wound with generative flesh-producing ointment until it is healed. (The word "generatiu" suggests that this ointment promotes tissue growth and healing.)
And if it is not converted (referring to the wound or infection), and many blisters have appeared on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then it is appropriate to apply cautery with water. Take a small quantity of arsenic or iron or peacock quill, place it over the boil; pour a little hot water into the cup and hold it, while you rotate it completely with compression from your hand, making sure that the edge of the cup is on the tip of the boil, so that the hot water can enter through the opening of the boil; then let the patient bear the burning sensation of the hot water for an hour, and keep it there, because the boil with its tips will be drawn out. (This passage suggests a form of blistering or cupping therapy using heated cups to draw out impurities from the body.)
And do the same for all (lesions or blisters) until they have all been treated on their surface.
And treat the pus that has emerged from the holes of the boils with those ointments which promote flesh growth. (This passage continues the discussion of blistering therapy, suggesting that after cupping or blistering, the resulting pus-filled lesions should be treated with an ointment to promote healing and tissue regrowth.)
Chapter III. (This is a header indicating the beginning of a new chapter in the text. The use of Roman numerals suggests that this text follows a formal structure or organization similar to other medieval medical texts.)
On the cautery for tremors. (This passage indicates that the following discussion will focus on the use of cautery, a form of surgical procedure in which a heated instrument is applied to the skin or flesh to promote healing and prevent infection, as a treatment for tremors.)
When you undertake to treat any tremor caused by cold in the nerves or fever from some other cause, it is appropriate to cauterize that area with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one between each vertebra; and also on the patient's feet, and over their stomach, with an olive-shaped cautery. (This passage suggests that tremors can be caused by various factors, including cold or fever, and that cauterization can help to alleviate these symptoms. The procedure involves applying a series of heated instruments to specific areas of the body, including the back, feet, and stomach.)
And the trembling in the patient will subside and hasten their recovery from illness caused by cold. (This passage suggests that cauterization can have a calming effect on the body, reducing symptoms of tremors or shaking associated with cold or fever, and promoting overall healing and wellness.)
Chapter LV. (This is a header indicating the beginning of a new chapter in the text. The use of Roman numerals suggests that this text follows a formal structure or organization similar to other medieval medical texts.)
On the cautery for symptoms of whiteness in the body. (This passage indicates that the following discussion will focus on the use of cautery as a treatment for various symptoms or conditions associated with whiteness in the body, such as pallor or discoloration.)
When the body becomes covered in white spots and pustules, which are caused by corrupt matter, it is necessary at the outset to prepare for cauterization of the entire head of the fistula with a fine-pointed cautery made from a twig of myrtle, the end of which has been extended with fire; or with a long scalpel blade; or with a lenticular cautery. (This passage suggests that whiteness in the body can be caused by various factors, including corrupt matter, and that cauterization can help to alleviate these symptoms. The procedure involves applying a heated instrument to the head of the fistula, or opening, to promote healing and prevent infection.)
And sometimes it is appropriate to cauterize adjacent to the beginning of the opening in this manner; and these are not believed (to be true fistulas), but rather a superfluity that has been disrupted, and they heal from this. (This passage suggests that some white spots or pustules may not actually be true fistulas, but rather a superficial layer of tissue or matter that can be removed with cauterization to promote healing.)
However, it is necessary to perform this procedure with evacuation through bloodletting. (This passage suggests that cauterization should be accompanied by other treatments, such as bloodletting or phlebotomy, to promote healing and reduce symptoms of whiteness in the body.)
Chapter LVI. (This is a header indicating the beginning of a new chapter in the text. The use of Roman numerals suggests that this text follows a formal structure or organization similar to other medieval medical texts.) [
On the cautery for symptoms of bleeding caused by an injury to the veins. (This passage indicates that the following discussion will focus on the use of cautery as a treatment for various symptoms or conditions associated with bleeding, such as wounds or injuries to the veins.)
Many cases of bleeding occur when a wound is opened outside the area where it should be, or when an incision is made in abscesses or cauterization of the limb, and this can make it difficult to heal. (This passage suggests that injuries or wounds to the veins or blood vessels can cause significant bleeding, which may be difficult to stop or treat with traditional methods. Cautery may be used in these cases to seal off the wound and prevent further bleeding.)
Therefore, when this occurs, you should place your hand over the orifice of the vein and apply pressure with your finger until the bleeding stops and does not start again. (This passage suggests that cauterization may not always be necessary to stop bleeding in a limb, and that direct pressure can be an effective alternative. By placing the hand over the wound and applying pressure, blood flow can be slowed or stopped, promoting healing and preventing further bleeding.)
And then place the olive-shaped cauteries in the fire for a short time, and breathe on them until they are very hot. (This passage suggests that cauterization may be used as a follow-up treatment to direct pressure or other methods of stopping bleeding in a limb. The cautery instrument is heated in a fire and then applied directly to the wound, sealing it off and promoting healing.)
And then take from them (the instruments) a small or large one, depending on the location and severity of the wound where the artery is ruptured. Apply pressure quickly to the affected vein with your finger, then cauterize the wound until it is burned and sealed shut, preventing further bleeding. (This passage suggests that cautionery can be used as a last resort in cases where direct pressure or other methods are not effective in stopping bleeding. The heated instrument is applied directly to the wound, sealing it off and promoting healing.)[
And if blood is flowing from the orifice of the artery while you are holding the cautery and pressing it, then take another cautery that has been prepared in the fire, and do not stop doing this until the bleeding has stopped. (This passage suggests that cautionery can be used as a first-line treatment for severe bleeding or injury. By applying heat directly to the wound, blood flow can be slowed or stopped, promoting healing and preventing further damage.)[
And be careful not to burn the nerves that are here, so that another illness does not come upon the patient. (This passage suggests that cautionery should be used carefully and with consideration for the potential risks involved. By applying heat directly to the wound, there is a risk of burning surrounding tissue or nerves, which can lead to further injury or complications.)
And know that when blood is flowing from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding in those cases except by one of four methods: with cautery as we have mentioned, or through extraction if it has not already been extracted, because when it has been extracted the ends are better burned and the blood flow is restricted. Or it can be tied with bile or lime for strong constriction, or medicines that restrict blood flow can be applied and strengthened with a cushion for proper compression. (This passage summarizes the various methods available for treating severe bleeding from an artery, including cautery, extraction, ligation, and application of constricting agents or medicines.)
But the one who administers proper constriction with lime and strong compression with cloth or by means of burning causes should not be hasty, but rather cautious. (This passage stresses the importance of taking care when applying constricting agents or using other methods to stop bleeding, as improper application can lead to further injury or complications.)
But if this happens in the absence of a doctor or medicine, then proceed with caution by placing your finger on the opening of that vein as we have mentioned, and apply strong pressure until the bleeding stops. Be sure to maintain this pressure until the bleeding has completely stopped and there is no further flow from the wound. Also, be aware of any potential damage to the artery and take care not to press too hard or cause further injury. If necessary, consider using cautery or other medicines to promote healing and prevent further bleeding. (This passage provides guidance for treating severe bleeding in the absence of a doctor or medical professionals.)
On incision, perforation, blistering, bloodletting, wounds and their likenesses. (This passage indicates that the second part of the text will focus on various surgical procedures and treatments for wounds and injuries.)
We have already said in the first chapter all about the illnesses for which cautery with fire and medicine is appropriate, as well as their occasions and causes, and the necessary instruments and forms of cauteries. And we have arranged the chapters from the top of the head to the feet. (This passage summarizes the contents of the first part of the text, which focused on various uses of cautery for medical treatment, including the types of illnesses that can be treated with cautery, their causes and symptoms, and the necessary instruments and techniques.)
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that those seeking may find what they are looking for. (This passage indicates that the second part of the text will follow the same format and structure as the first, with clear organization and explanations of various medical procedures and treatments.)
And before I begin, my son, it is important to note that in this chapter, we will address the things that were discussed in the first chapter on cautery. (This passage indicates that the second part of the text will build upon and expand upon the topics covered in the first part, providing additional detail and information on various medical procedures and treatments.)
And it is important to exercise great caution in the operations discussed in this chapter, as many of them involve evacuation through blood or other means that are vital to life. This may include venesection, lancing of abscesses or boils, purification of wounds, extraction of arrows or other foreign objects, incision for stone removal, and their likenesses. (This passage stresses the importance of careful consideration and preparation when performing surgical procedures, as many of them carry significant risks and require specialized knowledge and skills.) And all of them are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in the faces of their cats, death.
And I advise you that nothing of what is uncertain should fall upon you, because sometimes it may be necessary for you to deal with ill people in different ways. And some of them become angry with their illness and are afraid that they will die from it, both due to the severity of their symptoms and the length of time they have been ill, and because of the fear associated with the illness, which signifies death.
And there are some who give you their belongings and ask for your help in return, hoping to be cured of their illness, but the illness is destructive.
And so it is not appropriate for you to consent to such behavior from those who approach you with this attitude; and your caution should be greater than your avarice; and do not presume to make any judgments on the matter without proper knowledge, but rather seek certain scientific evidence that verifies it, and through which success you will receive praise.
And use in the treatment of all your patients a prognosis and indication that converts them to health, because in this way you will have assistance in achieving fame and memory, praise and glory.
Oh, sons, may God inspire you with understanding and not deprive you of guidance and protection, for it is in His hand.
And I have organized this chapter into sections according to the previous chapter on cautery, in order to make it easier for you to understand and address the issues related to treating pain from the head to the feet.
Chapter one.
On the treatment of fluid that is contained within the skulls of infants.
Know that this illness often affects infants around the time of childbirth, especially when the nurse lifts the infant's head without supporting it properly.
And sometimes it occurs due to hidden causes that are not known.
But I have not seen this illness in anyone except infants; and for all those whom I saw with it, their lives were at risk, and thus it seems to me that there is little hope for them.
And I have seen that an infant's head was filled with water, and their skull was constantly swollen so much that it could not stop growing due to the size of their head, and in fact the moisture continued to increase until it caused death.
And this moisture can either accumulate between the membrane and the bone, or it can collect beneath the bone on top of the skull.
Because when the fluid accumulates between the membrane and the bone and the abscess is small, it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the skull with a fissure that is wide enough for the fluid to drain out. The length of this incision should be two finger-widths long, which is just enough to allow the fluid to flow out, and this is the shape of the spatula:
And so if the fluid has increased significantly and the abscess is larger, then there should be two incisions made in this manner:
And if the fluid is beneath the bone, a sign of this is that you see the sutures on top of the head open in all directions and the water is pressed out when you press with your fingers on both sides of the middle of the skull, which is not hidden. It is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the skull with three fissures following this pattern:
and you should extract all the fluid through this incision; and strengthen the incisions with cloths and cotton swabs; and apply heat from above with wine and oil for up to five days; and loosen the ligaments and treat the wound with bandages and ointments, and bind the head with equal pressure; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until their member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another way of making an incision, which you should consider based on the size and location of the abscess and fluid collection. Sometimes it is larger in the occipital region, or in front, or to the right, or to the left. Therefore, pay attention to where the abscess and swelling are located, and make an incision there as best you can.
And be aware that you should not cut the artery and cause bleeding, which could lead to death for the patient due to a flow of blood with the drainage of fluid.
Chapter Two
When catarrh or rheum occurs in the eyes or feet, and it has become chronic and does not respond to medical treatment, then the last resort in this case is to make an incision in those two arteries.
And therefore it is appropriate when you want to make an incision on the patient's head, and roughly rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the veins, and strongly bind the patient's neck with some cloth; and consider feeling the pulse of the vein; and the locations of each (vein?) above the ears, which are slightly depressed, and become visible only in some people.
And then place your hand on the artery and feel for the pulse, and then make an incision with a sharp knife into each part of the skull, reaching down to the bone, to a depth equal to the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the knife under the artery and cut it at the point where it divides above.
And the length of the incision should be appropriate for the size of two fingers, because when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating flow, which jumps out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear near the surface, then it is necessary to measure three fingers' width from the ear and feel for the pulse there, and make an incision down to the bone.
And what is necessary to drain from the blood is a quantity of two ounces. And do not drain more or less than that, and all of this depends on the amount which appears from the strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
And then consider the wound and if there remains on the bone any pus-filled abscess, then incise it to prevent a dangerous abscess from forming.
And then strengthen the wound with feathers and bandages of linen, and care for it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter III.
Of the extraction of the veins which are in the temples.
When some people suffer from old chronic headaches or acute migraines due to moisture in the temples or veins in the temples that are hardened and similar to those conditions, and medical treatments do not help, then we have resorted to this treatment for these ailments: extraction of the veins in the temples or cauterization as we have shown.
And the method of the operation and extraction of these is for the patient to shave the hairs on their temples; and then locate the visible artery in the temple, which can be felt through its pulse, and may be hidden in some people due to intense rubbing.
And if it is hidden, then the patient's neck should be tightly bound with some cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or apply hot water until the artery becomes visible. And then take a knife of this shape: And then carefully scrape the skin until you reach the artery; and then cut into it with ease, extracting it from above in parts until you have extracted it from the skull and exposed all of the surrounding tissue.
But if the artery is thin, then wrap it with the tip of your finger and make an incision in one part according to the length by which the ends will be pulled apart and contracted, so that there is no flow of blood, because if they are not incised, the blood will not flow from all of them.
And then drain a quantity of two ounces of blood from it. between three,
And if the artery is large, then it should be tied in two places with strong double thread or with long cords, and care must be taken to prevent its decay before the wound heals and there is a flow of blood.
And then cut away any excess tissue between two bandages, and do this either immediately or at another time.
And if you wish, use a pointed cautery tool to cauterize the area down to the bone, and this will serve as a substitute for that invasive procedure.
And it is better for the patient not to have a fever or be in a hot condition because cauterization helps dry up moisture, and therefore it is better to use it as a treatment.
And it is necessary to extract the veins from the sites of old wounds and place powder made with care on top of them, and then care for the area with dry medicines that promote skin growth and with bandages until it heals.
And if during the procedure you discover an unexpected flow of blood from the artery, then quickly stop the bleeding using a cautery tool or by filling the wound with dressing, and then apply pressure to prevent further bleeding. And if none of those methods are available to you, then place your finger over the wound until the blood coagulates, and apply hot water until the swelling subsides, and bind it as needed.
And a simpler method of vein extraction is to use this pointed cautery tool with two blades, after you have marked the locations with your finger and then placed one blade at each location, igniting them until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, thus elongating the tissue between the ends which are not yet fully healed, as this is done without using a cautery tool.
And this is the shape of the cautery tool:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. However, if the sharpness of two blades is less than that of two knives, then it is better because if they are too sharp, they will easily cut through the skin and not allow for careful incisions.
Therefore, if the blades are thicker, then maintain a steady heat in them and cut through the skin gently.
And this method is better than any other and easier to perform.
And let the distance between the two blades be the width of a finger.
Chapter IV.
Of the care for eyes affected by sharp and acrid tears in the feet.
When the tears are sharp and acidic, and this is due to the veins on the forehead above the eyebrows, and no remedy from medical treatment provides relief, and the patient's face becomes red and they feel a sensation in their forehead like that of ants crawling, and their feet become weak, swollen, and their skin has begun to wrinkle, and their eyelids are inflamed due to the strength of the tears, then use this ancient remedy for curing such conditions using massage.
And it is commanded that the patient shave the hairs on their forehead and then make three equal incisions in the forehead along its length. And if the length of the incision is as follows: let one incision be equally distant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly longer than the length of the eyelids which are at the lacrimal, and the third on the other side.
And be careful of the incision near the arteries which are in two places, and extend your hand along the continuation of both jaws. And make the space of each incision three fingers wide.
And have at hand a piece of sponge or dry cloths to absorb the blood.
Then insert the spatula with two sharp ends, and this is the shape of the incision: Which extends from the temple to the second incision. Excoriate the entire area between the two incisions, including the zygomatic bone which is above the cheekbone, and then do the same on the other side, from the midline incision to the second incision. Then pull the skin taut with this spatula and insert again another instrument called a scalpel, which is sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
And place the sharp edge of the scalpel against the flesh attached to the cheekbone, and the blunt edge along the bone itself, then insert it into the incision and push it through to the midline incision, cutting all the blood vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But make sure that the incision continues along the cheekbone, and then do the same for the midline incision down to the other incision.
And since a large amount of blood may flow, press on the locations of the clotted blood accumulations.
Then place a piece of clean cloth in each incision, and cover them with powders mixed with wine and oil or vinegar. Observe that they do not become infected (or "caut" in the original text, which is likely short for "cauterizare", meaning "to cauterize").
On the third day, release the ligature and administer an infusion of hot water or tea, and then treat it with basilicon salve mixed with rose oil and other substances to promote healing of wounds.
This appears to be the end of one section or chapter (Capitulum V) of the medical treatise, and the beginning of a new one. If this is the case, it would not require translation or further context.
On the treatment of headaches using catharsis and for blood vessels descending from within the skull.
When there are acute and continuous headaches, accompanied by symptoms such as small dilated blood vessels in the patient's eyes, debilitation of their gaze, ulcers on their eyelids or eyebrows, and sharp pain and pressure in the forehead, then understand that these symptoms and the catharsis are due to matter from deep within the skull.
And the best treatment for this condition is as follows: direct the patient to rub their forehead, and then make an incision in the middle of their forehead, just large enough in width (and starting at the left temple, extending to the right temple; and ensure that it goes through the bone itself; and keep your hand away from the muscles responsible for chewing). This will expose the underlying bone.
Absorb all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth, and then insert a piece of clean cloth or gauze between the two lips of the incision, ensuring that it is sterile and free from contamination. Then apply powders mixed with wine and oil on top of it, to prevent infection or need for cauterization.
And when you see that the abscess has diminished, then clean the bone where the skin begins to form, and apply a drying treatment regimen, such as a mixture of wheat flour (two parts) and colophony resin (four parts), mixed together to create an ointment or plaster that can be applied to the wound, promoting natural skin growth.
This appears to be the end of one section or chapter (Capitulum VI) of the medical treatise, and the beginning of a new one. If this is the case, it would not require translation or further context.
On the treatment of what accumulates in the ears.
The cause of what accumulates in the ears is one of four types: it can be a mineral substance similar to stone, such as iron or glass, or it can be plant-based, like wax or bean fragments, or it can be a fluid, like water or vinegar, or it can be caused by an animal (such as insects).
Therefore, when there is mineral or other foreign matter in the ear that should not be present and does not belong there, expose the affected ear to sunlight, and if you see any stone or similar substance, use a solution of oil (such as lavender or sesame oil) to dissolve it. Then perform an extraction by creating a vacuum with your mouth near the ear, covering your nose and mouth with a cloth or handkerchief, and inducing a sneeze. And then place some cotton or wool balls in the ear canal, and gently pull the outer ear upwards to straighten out any curves or bends that may have been caused by the foreign matter. This can help ensure proper removal of debris or obstructions.
And if it is not removed, then perform an extraction using the delicate curved forceps known as "gesti epicicarios", which are shaped like this:
And if it is successfully removed with forceps, then that's good. But if not, then use a small pair of delicate tweezers to extract it from the ear canal.
Therefore, if it cannot be removed by those means, then make a small funnel made of silver (or another soft metal), and insert the tip of the funnel into the opening of the ear canal. Seal the area around the funnel with wax or softened oil to prevent any air from entering except through the funnel itself. And then extract it using your breath with strong suction, as this is often effective in removing debris and obstructions from the ear canal.
But if it cannot be removed in this manner, then take some alum powder or other similar substance and place it on the tip of a thin rod (such as a glass rod), and carefully wrap a small piece of cotton or gauze around the end to hold it in place. And then gently insert the applicator into the ear canal with ease, and carefully dry out the ear from any excess moisture or fluid that may be present.
Therefore, if it still cannot be removed using all the methods described above, then you should consider cutting or removing the affected area to prevent infection or other complications from developing.
The method of cutting or removing the affected area is as follows: first anesthetize the patient using the saphenous vein, then extract blood according to its virtue (i.e., using a tourniquet or other pressure device), and then hold the ear with your hands, turning it towards the upper parts. Make a small incision at the root of the ear, cutting through the cartilage in the most compressed area. And let the wound be of lunar shape, reaching down to the bone, and, with the bone exposed, remove any dead tissue using appropriate instruments; then quickly close the wound, taking care that it heals from within.
And if the cause of inflammation in the ear is an accumulation of fatty tissue that has grown and become swollen, then administer treatment and extract it. But if the patient does not obey your orders to eat less, then take fine, subtle sponge according to this method: and apply the absorption of that fat that has fallen into the ear.
And do not do that when you think the ear is already moist from its own vapor, but place it in dry compresses and then extract it with tweezers or a thin probe, as previously described, for this makes the extraction easier.
But in the water that has entered the ear, the patient must first cause sneezing with certain conditions at the beginning, and then fill the healthy ear with cotton, and cover the affected ear with a cloth. If this clears the obstruction, it is good. Otherwise, take fine, new lint or wool the length of the finger, heat them slightly in the fire, and have the patient insert one of these into the opening of their affected ear, jump on one foot while placing the other foot on the ground, and strike the outside of the ear with a cloth-covered stone. And continue doing this with a stone until all the water is removed.
And continue doing this with a stone until all the water is removed. And when the water has been completely removed, take some paper or cotton. and place one end of it in the ear and light the other end on fire until most of it is burned.
Then place another piece of cotton in the ear and repeat this process several times until all the water is removed. And straighten it with a cannula as described above, like the stone extractor.
But in the removal of an animal that has entered the ear, if it is a small creature, do as described above in division; but if it is large and causes pain to the patient, then extract it with forceps and probes. The cause of this problem is generally easier to deal with than other causes that can occur in the ear.
But in the removal of a worm born in the ear, when you treat it with what has been said above in division and in the treatment of distillations and not confuse your treatment, then it is necessary to examine the ear in the sunlight.
And therefore, if you see any signs of worms, then extract it with forceps or a thin probe. But if no signs are visible, then take a cannula that is narrow below and wide at the top, like this in shape: And insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate. Then suck with it using strong suction, and repeat this several times until all the worms are removed.
But if the patient does not obey your orders, then seal and close the opening of the cannula with wax as described above; then administer distilled liquids that have been proven effective in treating worms by ancient practitioners. You will find information about these in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion be the one with which you pour medical oils into the ear using this instrument of this shape: And make it from silver or copper, narrow below with a small opening at the bottom and flat on top.
And let it be as a plug that fits into the concavity of the cannula where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take a piece of reed and wrap it tightly with cotton at the end, then pour oil or the juice of any herb, or whatever medicine you choose, into the concavity of the cannula, which is inside the ear. Then insert the reed with cotton over it gently into the cannula, and press on it with a moderate force using your hand, causing the oil to be expelled in the concavity of the cannula, and the patient will feel the oil inside their ear.
And what is placed in the ear should be slightly burnt with fire beforehand. And make sure that the cause you will distill in the ear is not too cold, because medical treatments for the ear do not tolerate this well.
Chapter VII.
On the treatment of blockages in the ears.
Sometimes infants in their mothers' wombs do not have perforated ears, and this has also happened to some men. The ear canal may become obstructed by flesh growing inside it due to an injury or inflammation, and sometimes this obstruction occurs within the inner part of the ear canal, which is not visible from the outside, while other times it occurs in the outer parts.
And that which occurs inside the inner part of the ear canal, which is not visible from the outside, tends to be more difficult and challenging to treat.
And in the case where you can see the visible part of the ear canal, it is necessary to examine the patient's ear in sunlight and look carefully inside. And therefore, if you see an obvious obstruction, remove it with fine sponge of this shape:
Let the end of it be narrow in width, with one side being sharp and the other not, and the sponge should be two fingers wide so as to avoid harming the ear.
And therefore, if the obstruction is due to flesh grown inside or in the ear canal, then use thin forceps and cut carefully with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is inside the ear canal, then take a thin reed and heat it slightly over fire, then gently insert it into the ear canal.
And therefore, if you feel an obstruction with what the patient finds easy to hear, and it is due to pressure on the ear canal, gently relieve the pressure with ease while being careful not to damage the nerves of the ear.
And then place a cloth on the ear according to the size of the opening you have covered with egg white, for several days until you are sure that the wound has healed. Or you can take some and soak it in rose water and grind it into a powder, which you will use. And if you see that the ear is swollen, then open an abscess and replace it with another cloth dipped in wax made with olive oil, until the abscess subsides, and then cure it until it heals completely.
But if bleeding occurs, submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the ear, and use the other treatment that restricts blood flow, which is discussed in the treatise on distillations.
Chapter VIII.
Of the cure for blepharitis which occurs in the eyelids.
Blepharitis, which sometimes occurs in the eyelids of the eyes due to either being too moist or too dry.
Therefore, you should have those eyelids or wicks, and cut them into the shape of spatulas, then place them over the affected areas for thirty days.
But if pain and fluid flow like blood occur, then you should cauterize those with a subtle lacrimal cautery.
And the best cauterization is to return to incisions and trophies repeatedly until there remains any cause of their roots. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment for a large swelling that occurs in the eyelids of the eyes.
Many times swellings occur in the eyelids due to some cause that resembles hardness and durability, and because of this hardness it is called "grandissia".
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the eyelid, both above and below. [*Note: This is my best guess as to what "e desus" refers to, as it was not clear from the provided text.]
Therefore, the operation in this case is to consider whether the swelling has originated from the eyelid and spreads outwards to all parts, and its cause is light. [*Note: I have translated "mauguda a tota partida" as "spreads outwards to all parts", assuming it means that the swelling has affected other areas of the body beyond just the eyelid.]
Therefore, make an incision in that eyelid along the length, and then remove any excess tissue from all parts with ease until it dries out. Then suspend the wick and cut off any remaining excess. [*Note: I have translated "fen" as "make", assuming it is a command to perform a surgical procedure.]
And if the wound is large, you should adjust it with stitches and care for it until it heals.
And if it is small, there will be no harm in leaving the wound open as the ointment will heal and cleanse it.[*Note: I have translated "anguent" as "ointment", assuming it refers to a medical substance used for healing wounds.]
If the swelling is receding into the inner surface of the eyelid, you should expose the eyelid and suspend the swelling with a wick. Then apply pressure to it from all sides, even if the incision on the eyelid is long. This will not cause any problems. [*Note: I have translated "inscizio" as "incision", assuming it refers to a surgical cut made in the body. I have also translated "onguent" as "ointment", which is used to promote healing and prevent infection. Finally, I have translated "encerna" as "promote healing", based on its context.
And then make the incision, wash the eye with salt water, and care for the wound with a healing agent until it is healed.
Chapter 10:[*Note: I have added this line as it appears to be missing from the provided text.]
Chapter 10: Treatment of a Chalazion on the Upper Eyelid
A chalazion is a small, round, painless swelling that forms on the upper or lower eyelid due to blockage in an oil gland (meibomian gland) located in the eyelid. Chalazia are more common in children than adults and can cause redness, discomfort, and sensitivity to light. They may also affect vision if they become large enough to press on the eye.
And so you should see that the eyelashes are always on their faces and they sleep with them; and if the eyebrows of their lower eyelids are wet, there is already swelling present, which is covered by inflammation and the imminence of a cyst is apparent in the eye. Additionally, when you press on the area with your fingers, you can feel the cyst underneath it.[*Note: I have translated "jaser" as "eyelashes", assuming it refers to the hairs that grow on the edge of the eyelid. I have also translated "cara" as "face", but in this context, it likely refers to the surface of the eye. Finally, I have translated "centes accernac" as "you can feel the cyst", assuming it means that you can detect its presence by touch.
One method of treatment is to have the patient place their head on your lap, and then place a cloth over their face and provide warmth. Create a circle around the affected area that matches its size, making sure to include any surrounding inflammation. Then, place this circle onto the affected area and press gently with your fingers to encourage the growth of a chalazion in the center of the circle.
However, in the previous method, it is necessary to cut through the entire skin until you reach the chalazion, as the cyst often protrudes through a slit-like opening in the form of white grains.
Therefore, extract the cloth that you had wrapped between your fingers to the outer parts and rotate it with both hands until it is dispersed.[*Note: I have translated "draps" as "cloth", assuming it refers to a piece of fabric or bandage used during the medical procedure. I have also translated "envolopatz" as "wrapped", assuming that the cloth was wrapped around something, possibly the instrument used for incision. Finally, I have translated "dispargut" as "dispersed", assuming that the goal is to evenly distribute the medicinal substance on the cloth before applying it to the affected area.*]
And be careful not to insert the instrument into the incision too deeply, as you may damage the eye. Instead, gently press the spatula against the chalazion and make sure that it does not move towards the eye.[*Note: I have translated "spatum" as "instrument", assuming it refers to a medical tool used for making incisions or applying pressure to a specific area. I have also translated "ajustes" as "insert", assuming that the action is to place the instrument into the incision. Finally, I have translated "ladescas" as "damage", assuming that the risk is to cause injury to the eye if the instrument is inserted too deeply.*]
However, if no pus appears at the beginning of the incision, you should gently insert the instrument into the incision until pus begins to flow. Then, extract it as we have described earlier. After that, soak a piece of cloth in a mixture of water and wine, place it on top of the affected area, and secure it with bandages.[*Note: I have translated "aygua e vi agre" as "water and wine", assuming that it refers to a common medical treatment used during that time period. I have also translated "estrenh aquels am polvils" as "secure it with bandages", assuming that the goal is to hold the cloth in place over the incision.*]
And if necessary, add salt and place it in the concavity of the incision to ensure that all remaining moisture is removed.
Then care for the wound until it heals.
But if an abscess forms in the area of the incision, then treat it with a healing plaster until it heals. [*Note: I have translated "apostema caut" as "abscess", assuming that it refers to a localized collection of pus caused by infection. I have also translated "emplastres cedatils" as "healing plaster", assuming that it refers to a medical dressing used to promote healing and prevent infection.*]
Chapter 11:
Chapter 12: Methods of Touching the Eye[*Note: I have translated "tactimi" as "touching", assuming that it refers to medical procedures involving contact with the eye. I have also translated "del huel" as "of the eye", assuming that this chapter will discuss various methods for touching or manipulating the eye during medical treatments.*]
When hairs in the eyelids are caused by natural adjustments and are overgrown, then these hairs harm the eye and bring about ways of illnesses such as constant tears, softening of the eyelids and tissue inside, which can cause destruction of the eye that is called madness of the eye. The cure is in four ways: either with cautery using fire; or with acute medicine as mentioned before in the chapter on cautery; or it is done by inserting needles and suturing; or with small rods as I will describe.
Therefore, it is necessary that you place the patient's head on your lap; then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is turned, good; and if not, insert a needle in the one where there is more discharge below the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the discharge above, and that should be - near the edge of the eyelid where the lashes come out - near the lashes, and pull the discharge upwards with the eyelid, and turn that [the eyelid] with your finger.
And then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid near the lashes with a sharp spatula from the lacrimal [gland] major to the lacrimal minor; and then extract the discharge and place small pieces of lint or cloth underneath the eyelid, and then place a bandage over the eyelid with tension, and let it be as the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that it be in the shape according to the degree of swelling of the eyelid, because this is different among humans, for there are those who need a large incision from the eyelid according to the degree to which the eyelid is softened.
And then make an incision with the spatula on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the lacrimal major to the lacrimal minor. And if your incision is near the natural lashes as is the thickness of a king's coin.
And then place the probe in one of the two angles of the wound, and clean that completely, and then align the two lips with the incision using thin wool yarn or linen, and wipe away the blood, and make what is superfluous from the discharge adhere to the eyebrows with some sticky causes, if you want to do that, and if not, don't worry about it.
And then leave the suturing of the wound for three or four days, and take care of it.
And if you want to, leave the wound without suturing and take care of it with drying and constricting agents, because the eyelid swells due to the sealing of the wound and its accumulation; but suturing is better. Therefore, I have said this about cauterization.
However, it is necessary to pay attention to the patient and it is good practice, and it is not something to be feared.
And there is another way to cauterize, which is to mark on the eyelid a shape like a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three separate and connected probes according to this form:
But if that is not possible, take the probes and insert one with thread in the middle of the shape, and then place the other discharge near the lacrimal major, and the discharge near the lacrimal minor, and align the threads equally between your fingers, and then lift the eyelid with equal elevation, raise all the wound on which the mark has been made as we have recommended.
And then align the two lips of the wound with suturing, and take care of it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs at your incision or wound, calm that abscess with cerote and similar things, and with ointment.
And sometimes the eyelashes turn inward, then it is necessary to use what we have said about incision; but suturing is more artificial in each case.
Inserting needles is according to this form: And it is that you turn the eyelid and make an incision in the inner figure as I have described; and then, with skill, make two needles or two thin splints of which the length should be according to the length of the eyelid and the width smaller than the width of the spatula. And you have already made incisions at the ends of each partition, where the threads are.
Then attach each one with delicacy on what is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and constrict the needles of each partition with strong tension, and leave that for several days, because the wound due to the tension will dry up, become necrotic, and heal by itself as it falls off.
But if it takes too long, then break the attachment with tweezers, and then take care of the wound until it is healed.
Therefore, when it has healed, the eyelid is raised and the lashes do not prick.
And this is the form of two needles that you will make according to this form: [Here, an image or diagram would be provided in the original text.] and let it have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.

Chapter 12: On the elevation of pricking eyelashes in the eye with a needle when the lash is hard.
When there are non-natural, hard and rough, and prickly eyelashes, then the operation for this is that you take a thin needle and place it in a fine, subtle, and lion's fat, and then adjust the ends of it so that each one is placed in a subtle manner. And let the length of the threads be the quantity of one palm.
And then you should make another fine thread from the remaining one soon, and use the ends of it if you wish.
And then place the patient's head in your lap, and let it be near the sunlight so that your work is visible, because this is a subtle and small operation.
And then insert the needle into the base of the lash that requires adjustment with care, and make it penetrate into the eyelid quickly until you extract it from under the natural lash.
And then pull the lash upwards and insert it into the incision, and let there be one or two or three lashes and not more.
And then pull your hand away with that which the lash has been extracted, leaving it in alignment with the natural lash on the eyelid using adhesive.
But if it is adhered with adhesive and the lash is not extracted, then you will pull the adhesive down towards the base of the eyelid using the thread that you have made until it becomes adhered to the upper track.
And close that with the vision of the eye, because then you will remove the adhesive and thread, and close each eyelid, and leave it closed for two or three days until the lash adheres to its place and grows back with good flesh.
And if the hair is sparse, then attach artificial hair that matches the natural hair, and lift it up or let it stay as you extend it for some distance, and then lift it up.

On the treatment of a sty (an inflamed boil) that appears on the upper eyelid.
When a sty appears on the eye and is a contraction of the eyelid when it contracts above, to the right or left side, due to poor healing of a wound, cut or cauterization, and is called "leporina," and this sty can be either natural or accidental, and is caused by poor healing from wounds, cuts or cauterization, or similar neglect.
The method of the operation in this case is to cut open the wound and separate its lips, place a piece of linen cloth inside, between them, and bind it closed until healed.
And it is not necessary to use drying or astringent treatments for this condition because if you do so, the infection will worsen and become more severe than ever before.
Instead, use remedies that soften and promote healing such as fenugreek. Boil this herb in water with elder flowers and seeds, or mix it with vinegar or oil which has been heated with some other oils, submerge the cloth in this mixture and treat the sty with it.
And the success of your treatment lies in penetrating completely through any unhealed wounds, as you began at first.
And this procedure that we mentioned is simply a correction of the sty that does not restore the eyelid's appearance to its original state.
Chapter 14.
On the treatment of a sty (an inflamed boil) that appears on the lower eyelid.
This sty (an inflamed boil) that appears on the lower eyelid is truly called a sty and can be either natural or accidental in origin.
But an accidental sty is caused by wounds, cuts, cauterization or similar causes.
The method of treating this sty is to thread a double-pointed needle and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the inner corner of the eye (nearest the nose) to the outer corner (towards the ear), so that the thread passes through both edges of the eyelid.
Then pull the skin taut with the needle and stitch it together with the needle, cutting a wide incision. And when the eyelid's appearance is restored to normal, it is good; but if not, then take a thread and place it in the cut incision, using this thread to pull the eyelid into shape, and make two cuts on either side of the lower eyelid.
And the ends of these two cuts should be at the two corners where they converge, forming a shape that resembles their natural form when they come together.
And this shape resembles the Greek letter lambda (λ).
Then remove the excess skin from the eyelid to match the size of the cut below it.
Then join the separated parts and stitch them together using wool thread, and treat the wound with the remedies we previously mentioned, including softening agents and poultices until it heals.
And if the sty is caused by a cut, stitch or cauterization, then it is necessary to make an incision along the eyelashes of the eyelid as described earlier. Then separate it with a poultice between its two edges, as we previously mentioned.
In summary, the treatment for stys on either the upper or lower eyelid should follow the procedure we have outlined, depending on their shape and form which is often irregular and varied.
And wise practitioners always prepare various methods and techniques to restore the appearance of the affected area as closely as possible to its natural state or near it, depending on what is appropriate for each patient in terms of the procedure and instruments used.
Chapter 15.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in some people, such that the eyelid is stuck to the white part of the eye, and movement is difficult and interferes with natural functions, then it is necessary to insert a thread below the eyelid, lift it up or stretch it using a hook.
Then you should carefully cut the adhesion with a sharp blade that is not too sharp or pointed, so as not to disturb the patient during the operation, and leave the blade in place without touching the eye itself.
And your incision should separate the adhesion easily, allowing the eyelid to return to its natural shape and heal completely.
Then rinse the eye with salt water, or drip on it juice from crushed juniper berries that has been dissolved in water.
Then use a poultice made from the same herb to separate the eyelid and eye, apply wool soaked in egg white over the eye, and for three days use remedies that promote healing until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
On the incision of an ingrown nail and a fleshy growth on the tear duct.
Know that there are two types of nails, one is nervous and hard like a thin piece of ivory, the other is non-nervous, similar to white congealed moisture, which when cut or forced to be trimmed with a hook, becomes detached but does not allow the hook to penetrate.
And both types of nails begin growing from the inner corner of the eye, gradually covering it and preventing light from entering and interfering with blinking.
However, the method for treating it is as follows: have the patient tilt their head back and open their eyes wide, lift the eyelid with your hand and use tweezers with a small loop at one end to gently pull out the ingrown nail, stretching it upwards. Then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair or ox or cow hair, or something similar, or strong thread, then gradually sharpen the tip of the needle and insert it into the middle of the nail, penetrating with the needle and tying the nail with the strong thread. Stretch it upwards and scrape away with the horsehair the layer of skin attached to the nail that covers the pupil. And you continue to do this with the horsehair until you reach the base of the nail.
Then you should carefully cut the remaining piece of skin attached to the corner of the eye with a sharp blade or small scissors, leaving behind only the natural skin of the tear duct so that an incision does not cause continuous tearing.
Sometimes the nail can be stretched with just a hook or strong thread as previously mentioned, but other times it needs to be scraped away with a scalpel that has this shape:
And be careful not to touch the corneal membrane with the scalpel and make sure that it cuts through without damaging the pupil.
Then apply a little crushed salt or onion juice to the eye and leave it for a day before treating it with appropriate remedies until it heals.
But if the nail is not nervous and you cannot insert the needle, nor pull it out with the hook, then many times this type of ingrown nail can be cured with medication and heals as previously mentioned in the division.
But if you want to incise it, then open the patient's eye and take a thin scalpel shaped like this: I translate the line as follows: I translate the line as follows:

Once the incision is completed and all the flesh is opened up, then fill the wound with crushed salt, or distill on it a red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place a compress soaked in beaten egg white inside until it is protected from developing an abscess.
And if there remains any cause of inflammation and bleeding in the wound, and you fear the development of an abscess, then leave the wound open and treat the abscess with whatever will alleviate it, and repeat this operation until it is healed. Similarly, do the same for the surrounding flesh that may be affected by this type of inflammation.
However, you must avoid any cure of the wound by natural or accidental means using iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the member can withstand the operation.
Chapter 18.
On collecting pus in the wound.
Pus is red veins that are swollen on the surface of the wound and prevent urination by obstructing its operation, causing the wound to remain open for several days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning to consider whether the wound in which there is pus is strong and not affected by any other ailment but pus, then you can collect it.
And you should instruct the patient to place their head on your lap, and then suspend those veins with an ounce or two according to your judgment; and let that ounce be made of delicate material in the following manner:
Or make two ounces in one piece in the following manner:
And then bind those veins with gentle forces and carefully clean the blood away periodically until you see that the veins have separated from the wound and are relaxed.
And be careful not to damage the wound with the ends of the spatula; and perform this procedure in the afternoon facing the sun, and be very precise in your operation so that you only incise those veins.
And when you have finished, then distill onto the wound either green or red vinegar to dissolve with its corrosive power what has been separated from the pus.
But if it is not possible for you to collect everything in that hour, then bandage the entire area with something that alleviates its pain, and leave it for several days until the pain subsides and there is no risk of abscess formation.
And then repeat the procedure in the same manner until it is healed.
Here is the shape of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
On reducing a deviated septum in the nose.
When you treat a deviated septum with cauterization or corrosive medicine, as described earlier, and it is not healed, then do not give up but rather make an incision on the abscess until its maturity is reached, and extract all of the moisture within it until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then use an instrument of this shape:
And it is called an instrument with a rough tip, made of iron and round like a finger, with many small holes created by grinding or filing. Here is its shape:
And place this instrument on the corrupted area of the bone, and then carefully move it between the teeth, while applying gentle pressure with your hand until you feel that the corruption has been scraped away.
And repeat this process several times, and then restore the area with drying and styptic agents.
Therefore, if after 40 days the area has become solid and healthy tissue has grown, the pus-filled flesh has been removed, there is no renewed infection or abscess formation, and no other complications have arisen, then you will know that it is healed.
But if not, then do not give up but instead work to reshape the fracture in the nose, using this method: First, remove the covering of bone using iron or corrosive medicine. Once the bone is exposed, take hold of it as follows:
The end of the iron should be triangular in shape, and the stem should gradually taper towards the end as needed.
And place the instrument on the bone, positioning it near the tear duct. Gently pull back the skin around the wound and then carefully rotate your hand so that the forceps penetrate deeply into the bone. The patient will feel a sensation of pressure as they exhale when you apply gentle traction to their hand.
Therefore, after this procedure, restore the area using styptic and drying agents as instructed.
And when the flesh has grown and the area has hardened, the material that was expelled to the surrounding parts returns to the nose, which is a lighter burden for the patient.
Chapter 20.
On reducing a prominence in the wound.
When the wound protrudes in its entirety and causes no harm or reduction in function, then it is necessary to relax the patient by having them follow you and apply cupping glasses to their neck without scarification, drawing out the bad humors through vigorous suction. Additionally, apply a liniment made from aloes, wax, pitch, and gum tragacanth to the wound, followed by a strong emplaster on the wound with many powdered herbs.
The method for making the powder involves taking linen cloths and cutting them into four layers, then grinding these layers into a powder.
And then layer these powders one on top of the other according to the quantity required by the size of the wound. And then apply a strong, tight bandage over the powder using a hard cloth. Repeat the cupping glasses with suction but without scarification. Then remove the cupping glasses and leave the wound tightly bound day and night.
But if during this time the ligament becomes softened, then it is necessary to make it tight.
And then bind the ligament day and night, as we have said.
And if you see that the wound has already been reduced, that is good, but if not, then repeat the application of the poultice with the powders and tight binding and cupping glasses until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
On incising the prominence of the uveal tunica (choroid).
When there is a disruption in the tunica uvea and it protrudes like a raisin beyond the eyelids, making the shape of a man's face, and you wish to make an incision in this area, then the operation is as we have recommended: insert the needle into the slit of the uvea from the lower part towards the upper part, and then insert another needle with double thread on the side near the tear duct. Make it penetrate and leave the first needle as it was positioned; and then make an incision in the area of the double thread and lift the part of the uvea along the curve of the needle, and strengthen that spot.
And then remove the needle and place wool soaked in beaten egg white over the wound, and leave it until the thread comes out with the grape (the protruding tissue).
And then heal the wound with something that comforts the interior so that the wound can be healed.
Sometimes, gather all the edges of the wound with a circle of cloth so that it is raised and even, then pierce it with a fine probe to reach the depth of the wound and allow any pus or fluid to drain out, reducing swelling and allowing the wound to heal quickly.
And strengthen it so that it heals.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of cataracts.
This illness that is called "alconati" is nothing but an opaqueness that has formed on the eye, resembling water descending and not actually being so.
The method for treating this condition involves having the patient sit on a specially prepared chair with their head positioned so that you can see the opacity in their eye. Then, using your hands, gently press on either side of the patient's head to prevent any fluid from draining and obstructing the view. This will allow you to observe the causes of the condition as the patient sees them.
And if it does not drain downward, know that it is water.
But if the fluid or material has not been prepared for draining as we have described, then position the patient between your hands and use a fine probe to gently create an opening in the conjunctiva just above the cornea, taking care not to damage the surrounding tissue. Continue this process until the cataractous material has been removed.
Once the cataractous material has been removed, then distill some warm water with caudal (a type of animal fat) in which you have mixed honey or water that has been boiled with fenugreek and honey into the eye.
And then it should be treated with other causes until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of watery eyes.
We have already discussed the types of water in the eye and how to identify them by their appearance. Now, based on the health of the patient, you should proceed accordingly.
Therefore, you should position the patient between your hands with their head resting on a cushion and gently hold their eyelids open.
And place your left hand near the patient's upper eyelid, if the affected eye is the left one; or use your right hand, if the affected eye is the right one.
And place your right hand on a clay compress, if the affected eye is the left one; or use your left hand, if the affected eye is the right one.
And place the end of the clay compress near the crown by the inner corner of the affected eye, close to the smaller tear duct, and then roll the clay compress gently with your hand, applying some pressure.
And place the compress so that it penetrates into the eyelid and ensure that the clay has made contact with the eyeball.
It is necessary for the thickness of the clay compress to be equal to the width of the space between the pupil and the edge of the eye, also known as the crown of the eye. This is because you will be able to see the pupil with clarity through the transparent cornea, allowing you to ensure that the compress covers the entire area.
And place the clay compress on the affected area where the watery fluid is present, and gently press down several times, repeating this motion until the fluid begins to drain. Once the fluid has drained, have the patient slowly open their eye, and ensure that the compress is properly positioned over the eye.
And pause for a moment; if the fluid has drained, then continue to press down gently several more times before removing the compress.
And when the fluid has stopped draining, gently remove the clay compress and clean the eye area with your hand. Dissolve a small amount of clear gemstone salt in water and use this solution to irrigate the eye. Then apply a dry bandage or gauze infused with rose oil and egg white to the patient's closed eye, securing it in place.
However, in our time, we do not use a compress made of three hundred-year-old egg whites.
And if the patient is unable to tolerate the clay compress due to its hardness, as some people have very hard eyes, then it is necessary to use a different instrument called an alberite, which has the following form:
And use the alberite to pierce the conjunctiva, taking care not to penetrate too deeply into the eye and instead creating a small passage for the clay compress.
And then insert the clay compress as previously described.
And at this point, the treatment is complete. Prepare a suitable resting place for the patient, with a bed that allows them to lie on their back in a dark room, and instruct them to remain still and avoid any movements.
And allow the treatment to take its natural course, so that it may be effective without causing any harm or adverse effects, either to the patient's head or in any other direction.
And the bandage should remain in place for up to three days, depending on the patient's individual needs and circumstances.
And remove the bandage in a dark room and uncover the patient's eye, allowing them to see various objects and stimuli. Then replace the bandage within seven days.
And it is not necessary to perform this procedure during the hours of infusion or immediately beforehand. It is necessary that you be cautious when performing this procedure, as the water can easily flow out due to the force of the eye's natural movements and blinking.
However, if an abscess forms in the eye, then it is necessary to uncover the eye within seven days and treat the abscess with appropriate medical interventions.
And now you have completed the treatment for the patient's eye and should place a protective covering over their face to prevent them from touching or rubbing their eyes for several days while they recover in a dark room.
And then, gradually reintroduce the patient to normal light and activities, allowing them to engage with their surroundings and daily routines as they recover.
And know that in the practice of alchemy, it is not uncommon for students to experience visual hallucinations or sensations. Therefore, you should be bold and confident when performing this operation.
And now, some of those who practice the art of alchemy have reported that they create a fire in the magical air using a perforated clay vessel, which causes water to flow or gather.
However, I have not seen or heard of anyone in our land who has perfected this technique, nor is it mentioned in any of the ancient texts. It is possible that this method is new and has not yet been widely adopted or studied.
And these are the forms of the types of magic vessels that can be used by those who are unfamiliar with them:
And these vessels can be made of clay or iron specifically, with their outer edges tapering to a sharp, triangular point, giving them this particular shape.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of a fleshy growth in the nose.
When various fleshy growths appear in the nose, which are caused by some factor that resembles the sting of a scorpion with heavy motions or a fleshy polyp that resembles a foot; this condition is called polyps because it resembles the shape of a foot. And this growth is cancerous, ulcerated, and dark in color; and it is a lion-shaped flesh that is not dark in color.
And in the case of a non-cancerous, lion-shaped flesh growth, it is necessary to have the patient sit between your hands and expose them to the sun, while you hold their nostrils open and gently prick the growth with a needle or other sharp instrument. And then carefully remove the growth from the outside, and use a sharp spatula to cut away the flesh from the inside, ensuring that you have removed all of the tissue. If there is any remaining cause for an abscess to form, then gently and carefully use one of your fine instruments to remove any remaining tissue or debris. However, if the growth is accompanied by bleeding or forms an abscess, then you should stop and apply appropriate treatment; in the case of a malignant abscess, you should be cautious and carefully cauterize the area to ensure that all pus-filled cavities are removed.
And then the wound should be rinsed with vinegar and water or wine. However, if the nostrils are open and there is moisture present between the nasal passages and the palate, then you should know that the patient has healed.
However, if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you should know that inside the patient's nostrils there is a fleshy growth on the upper bones of the nose, which has not been reached by the incision.
And in this case, it is necessary to insert a piece of liver from an animal with some thickness into the patient's nostrils, and leave it there for several minutes, repeating this process multiple times. Gently insert one end of the liver into the nostril using a thin rod or other instrument that is suitable for this purpose.
And when this is done, the liver's scent will be released and will enter the nasal passages, exiting through the nostrils and reaching the patient's throat. This action is similar to what young children do in school, and it is a simple process for those who wish to perform it.
And then place both ends of the liver inside the nostrils, with one end protruding outside and the other remaining inside. Administer small bites or sips of flesh from the liver using the teeth, continuing until you know that the patient's nasal passages have been fully treated with the liver's juices.
And then remove the liver and insert some gauze or cloth into the nostrils to absorb any residual blood. Repeat this process for three days or more, until all remaining tissue from the growth has been completely removed.
And at the end of the treatment, insert a tube made of lead into the nostrils for several days until the patient has fully healed.
However, if you find that the treatment is causing dryness or irritation, use this alternative method instead:
And this is the form of the instrument called "capipurge fazedor," which is used to distill oils and medicines into the nostrils:
And this instrument should be made of silver or clay, resembling a small lamp or basin with an opening at the top, similar to a small dish or container.
And if desired, you can also create a closed nozzle or spout that resembles a small pipe or straw, while the nozzle of the capipurge fazedor instrument should be flat and open. Attach a handle to the back of the instrument, allowing you to hold it securely when heating oil or other liquids or vapors in the device.
Chapter 25.
On warts found at the edges of the nose.
Warts often appear at the edges of the nose and can become enlarged or swollen over several days until they are easily noticeable.
Therefore, it is necessary to incise or cut into the wart as soon as it appears, and remove all of the affected tissue. And then apply a cauterizing agent or burn-inducing medicine directly to the affected area, in place of the removed tissue.
However, if the incision is delayed until the wart has become enlarged, then consider whether it has become hardened, thick, dark in color, and with reduced sensitivity. If so, do not touch it with iron, as this could cause a cancerous abscess to form. In many cases, those who incise such growths suffer great harm as a result.
And if the abscess has a bluish-red appearance and is not dark in color, and incision is possible in its entirety, then evacuate the patient and make an incision without fear, and cure the area with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter twenty-six.
On suturing the nose, lips, and ear when continuity is dissolved by wounds or similar causes.
Know that when there is dissolution of continuity in one of these cartilaginous structures, you should not engage much in this operation except for experienced men.
Therefore, when you attend to any such cause (i.e., an injury), consider whether it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then you should approximate the two lips of the wound with suture, and then cure that area until it is healed.
And if the lips of the dissolution of continuity are already separated and both are made healthy, then it is appropriate that you dissect each part of its edge that appears until blood comes out. Then bring together the two lips with suture and constrict those areas, and over them sprinkle dragon's blood powder and apply three hundred of it, and place on top of the powder a piece of emplaster defragrated or of another consolidating plaster, and leave that application for two days or three. Then undo it and replace the plaster and leave it until the pus has been discharged by itself, and then cure with ointment until it is healed.
However, the method of suture is that you bring together the dissolution of continuity with needles as we have recommended in the suturing of the abdomen, or bring together the dissolution of continuity with thread as I have shown you.
Chapter twenty-seven.
On the extraction of those causes that arise within the two lips of the divided parts.
Often it happens that unwise men develop hard abscesses similar to goose fat in the divisions of their lips, and some of them are smaller while others are larger.
Therefore, it is appropriate that you incise and cut open each of those hardenings in its entirety, and then make an incision and fill that area with three hundred units of cautery (sagi trissat) until the blood is constricted, and then wash it with vinegar and cure the location with something astringent, until it is healed.
Chapter twenty-eight.
On the incision of tight skin on the gums.
Often it happens that a tight skin on the gum, which the ancients called "albulus," becomes swollen. In this case, you should suspend it with an onci (a surgical clamp) or hold it with forceps and make an incision along its length, allowing the pus to drain or the blood to flow.
Then, place on the area sage trissat or another powder that is astringent (stiptic) or desiccative (excicative).
And if the tight skin returns, then you should make an incision again and cauterize it, because the cautery will not return (i.e., cause further damage).
Chapter twenty-nine.
On the extraction of teeth with forceps.
When sharp, rough edges are found on the surface of teeth in their divisions or roots, and they are tight between the gums (gingivas) and cause dark coloration or are made citrine or greenish, and through this, corruption is seen in the gum, causing loose teeth.
And therefore, it is appropriate that you make the patient sit between your hands and place their head on your lap, and file down the teeth where those sharp edges and causes similar to sand are present until no cause remains, and do this for the darkness, citrinitis (yellowish discoloration), and other issues until they are corrected.
Therefore, if this happens at the beginning of the treatment, it is good; and if not, then you should repeat the treatment on those (affected parts) every day for two or three days until it takes effect as you wish.
And know that teeth require words of various forms and many figures, depending on what is required for your operation. (I'm assuming "operation" here refers to some sort of dental procedure) And so, since the blades with which you cut away the part of the tooth are different from those used for cutting between teeth, you must prepare yourself for various forms of blades, which you will see shortly.
Capital Chapter 30. (or just "Chapter 30" if that sounds better)
On the extraction of teeth.[**line break***\*\*
It is necessary that you cure the tooth of its pain with all caution and gradually during the whole process of extracting it, because there is no reason to hasten its removal once extracted, as it is a subtle substance that should be carefully removed during the extraction procedure.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is causing pain, because often the pain deceives the patient and they think it's in a healthy tooth, leading you to extract the wrong one, and the pain persists until the actual sick and painful tooth is removed. We have seen this happen during barbers' operations.
Therefore, how do you determine which tooth is painful? Well, when you are unsure, then it is necessary to scarify the gum around the tooth with a spatula containing some substance that can dissolve it, until it separates from both sides of the gum, and gently use those tweezers or fine forceps to extract it gradually.
And also use strong tongs to firmly hold the patient's head and place it between your knees so that they cannot move, then pull the tooth carefully in a straight line so as not to break it or cause them more pain.
And so, if it is not already loose, then take one of those instruments and gently insert it under the tooth from all sides with ease and apply gradual force to loosen it as you begin.
But if the tooth is broken or corroded, then it is necessary to wrap a piece of cloth around the fracture and secure it with a thin wire, so that it does not break during your forceful extraction using tongs.
And you must operate carefully with scarification around the entire gum area and be cautious not to break it while making sure that it remains partially attached. Then gently return the patient's mouth to its original position, being mindful of their discomfort which may be greater than the initial pain.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their eagerness and recklessness during tooth extractions, without administering what has been recommended. They often cause greater injuries that are difficult to heal and require further treatment or even removal of bones from the jaw, as we have witnessed many times.
And also rinse the patient's mouth with wine vinegar or wine with salt after extracting the tooth.
And if bleeding continues after that, then apply some crushed egg and sprinkle it over the wound, and if there is still no relief, cauterize the area to stop the bleeding.
The shape of the forceps and fine tongs used to extract the tooth should have a long shank, short handle, and wide grip to avoid bending when using them.
And they should also have a thick handle so that when you squeeze with them, they don't bend and have short shanks.
And they should be made of iron from India, straight in shape with long handles. On the ends of these handles, there should be teeth that fit into each other and squeeze forcefully. Sometimes, the ends of these tools have a bird's beak-shaped form called "guanta," which has strong squeezing power.
Capital Chapter 31.
Chapter 31: On tooth extraction and bone removal from fractured jaws.
When should you extract a tooth that has become loose but still cannot be removed? In this case, it is necessary to place a compress on the affected area for one or two days until it becomes soft. Then, use tongs with thin handles resembling the beak of a bird called "ciconia" or "guanta," which have strong gripping power, similar to forceps.
The ends of the tongs are shaped like a file or rasp.
If the tooth does not respond to your efforts with these forceps or tongs, then you must saw along the root and remove all the flesh until you can insert an instrument called "atali," which is a small lever with the following shape: (description follows)
And it should have a short, thick end that is not curved to prevent it from breaking.
Therefore, if the root is removed through this method, it's good. If not, use these other instruments with the following shapes: The first instrument has a triangular handle with some thickness to it.
The shape of the second instrument is also triangular, but more slender in its ends.
And now you can assist yourself with this instrument that has two hooks, whose shape is as follows: And also with other dental instruments that I will mention. They assist in tooth extraction and their shape is like a large ounce (unit of weight), and its form is as follows:
With a triangular, twisted or short end that has some thickness and is not curved to prevent it from breaking.
And know that dental instruments are similar to other surgical instruments.
But skilled and clever surgeons can find suitable instruments for themselves based on the operation and various diseases because there are many types of conditions that ancient doctors did not mention or create specific tools for due to the variety of forms and species.
But if the jawbone or other bones in the mouth are fractured or broken, then treat it with appropriate instruments and forceps as we have mentioned during tooth extraction. Also, use a lever with the following shape: (description follows)
And it should have some thickness gradually, and be held tight in the mouth so that it does not escape or drain until the bone is fully extracted. Then restore the area with suitable medications for healing.
But if there is a small fracture in the bone, then scrape away the broken pieces and any blackness around it, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter 32.
Chapter 32: Treatment for prominent teeth.
When teeth are prominent and do not follow their natural form, especially when it happens to women and young girls, then you should consider: if the tooth is too close to another tooth without any possibility of removing it or creating space between them, then root that tooth; but make sure it's not attached to another tooth. If the tooth is separated from other teeth but still protruding, then use this instrument with a sharp end similar to a pig's snout made of Indian iron. [**line break***\*\*
And the incision you make to cut the tooth should be made gradually over several days due to the hardness of the tooth and to avoid damaging other teeth.
And if it is an exposed tooth susceptible to filing down, then file it down with a file made of Indian iron with the following shape: (description follows)
And let it be made entirely of Indian iron with many small points like the file used for making needles. With this tool, the tooth should be filed down gradually over several days with ease to avoid damaging other teeth or causing discomfort. And smooth out the rough edges of the tooth at the end and remove any sharpness with some razors.
And if it is a tooth where a part of it has broken off and you can feel sharpness when you touch your tongue to it, then you should file down the rough edges until the sharpness is removed and the area is smoothed out so that your tongue does not get hurt and your speech is not affected.

Chapter 33: Restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver alloy. [**line break***\*\*
When a tooth is loose due to trauma or extraction by percussion or forceps and the patient cannot bite down on it, and you have treated it with styptic medicines but to no avail, then use gold alloy to strengthen the weakened tooth instead of silver alloy, as silver can turn black and discolor over time, while gold remains unchanged.
And let the alloy be of such fineness and thickness according to the quantity that can fit between the teeth; and the shape of the filling is to take the alloy and place twice as much between two healthy teeth, and gradually increase the thickness of the alloy between two weakened or broken teeth, until the filling reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. [**line break***\*\* And repeat the filling process gradually, starting from where you began, applying gentle pressure with your hand until it is securely in place and not damaged.
And the tool used to press down the alloy into the teeth should be designed so that it does not create any gaps or spaces.
And remove any excess alloy from the ends with forceps or tweezers and press it down into the spaces using a lever tool. Then shape and conceal the excess in between the healthy tooth and weakened tooth, to avoid injury to the tongue. And let it be as tight as a Roman road.
But if it becomes loose or broken, strengthen it with more alloy in the same manner at any time. [**line break***\*\*
And this is the shape of teeth and the pattern of aligning two healthy teeth with two weakened or damaged teeth, as shown in these illustrations. [**line break***\*\*
When it is necessary to realign and replace a tooth or teeth in their proper position, and they are strengthened as we have recommended, then:
And only an experienced and skilled practitioner can perform this task well.
And sometimes it is appropriate to use cow bones as a substitute for teeth, which are shaped like actual teeth and placed in the area where the tooth is missing, strengthened and used for a long time. [**line break***\*\*

Chapter 34: Incision of the ligament that causes speech impediment. [**line break***\*\*
This ligament under the tongue can be congenital or acquired through injury or illness that has already healed. [**line break***\*\*
And the operation on the patient is for you to open their mouth, with their head positioned in your lap; and lift their tongue, and then make a incision in those tight nerves at the latitude where the tongue is freed from its base.
But if there is any hardness or stiffness there, and that is caused by consolidation of the wound, then you should pour vinegar and cut through it at the width where you have made the incision, so as to loosen the knot.
And be careful not to make a fissure in the skin of the flesh, and that you cut too deeply so as to cause bleeding.
And then let the wound be washed with water or sour wine or warm water, and place a soft piece of linen under the tongue; that is, a piece of linen that keeps the patient's tongue down, so it does not become consolidated again.
But if there is a flow of blood, place vitriol tripoli on the spot; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a lancinating cautery, which is appropriate for that purpose. And perform that treatment until the other causes are healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula from under the tongue.
Sometimes, small abscesses occur under the tongue that resemble little grapes, preventing the tongue from its normal operation; and it is easy for them to grow until they fill the mouth.
And the procedure for this is that you should open the patient's mouth wide in front of the sun and examine the abscess.
And if you see that it is of a dark or black color and hard, and the patient cannot feel it, then do not touch it because it is cancerous.
And if it tends towards whiteness and has moisture, then you should pour vinegar on it and make an incision with a sharp scalpel, cutting through all sides; and if bleeding occurs during the procedure, then place vitriol tripoli on top of it to stop the flow of blood.
And then return to your work until you have treated it completely and washed it with sour wine and salt; and treat the area with other treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
On the extraction of abscesses in both ears and those that are located in the throat, as well as other abscesses.
When abscesses occur in the throat, they are usually tonsilloliths (glands) that are soft and round, which sometimes protrude outside and are called ears (aurelhas); when you treat them with what we have said earlier and they are not healed, then you should consider whether the abscess is hard, dark in color, and has little sensation; if so, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and swollen, then do not touch it with iron due to the risk of bleeding; instead, allow it to mature first before attempting to extract it or letting it break open by itself.
And if it is white and soft, then it should be incised.
And the procedure for this is to consider before your operation whether the abscess has rested completely or if it has diminished in some way; and then, have the patient lie down facing the sun, with their head in your lap, open their mouth, and a servant should hold the patient's tongue down using a noble instrument of this shape:
And let it be made of silver or silk, and be fine like a knife.
Then, as you hold the instrument against their tongue and expose the abscess, place your finger over it and then take vinegar and apply it to the wound; next, pour some vinegar into the spoon and use it to irrigate the area around the wound while pulling out the pus gently but firmly. Or if you extract any pieces of tissue, then use an instrument with this shape:
Or if you extract any pieces of tissue, then use an instrument with this shape: And it is similar to forceps, except the ends are curved so that the tips of each side face one another and are very sharp, with the entire instrument made of iron.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then use a scalpel with this shape instead: It should be sharp on one side and dull on the other.
And once you have incised one abscess, then proceed to the next using this same method of incision, and ensure that the patient's wound is cleaned with warm water.
But if there is bleeding, clean the wound with a decoction of chamomile or myrtle leaves and similar styptic agents until the bleeding stops, and continue to care for the wound until it heals.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those two "ears," and you should incise these as well using the same technique I have described for two abscesses.
I once treated a woman with an abscess in her throat that had turned dark purple and lacked sensation; it had already closed off her throat, causing her to breathe with difficulty, and she had stopped eating and drinking water, leaving her on the brink of death if not for timely intervention.
And the abscess had grown so large that it took two months to finally rupture and drain through two openings.
I carefully inserted a probe and then one of my fingers into one of the openings, extracting a large piece of pus, followed by inserting the probe into the other opening to ensure complete drainage; then, I opened the patient's mouth wide and held their tongue down while reinserting the probe into the abscess.
I then proceeded to cut away a large portion of the remaining abscess, which only released a small amount of blood. And so the woman's throat was healed, and she began drinking water and eating food soon after; I continued to treat her abscess with frequent incisions for a long time, as new abscesses kept forming in place of the old one, which required ongoing treatment until they were completely resolved.
I then applied a cautery to her throat and sealed it, thus ending the procedure; but as for what became of her after that, I cannot say for certain.
Chapter 37.
On incising a swollen vein when it has become abscessed.
When catarrheal matter accumulates in the vein and it becomes swollen and abscessed, with a lengthy appearance, then it is called perpendicular; but if it appears thick and round in the lower part, it is referred to as a bubo.
But when it has been healed using the methods I have described and yet there remains some residual swelling that does not respond to treatment, and an abscess forms again, appearing rounded; or if it extends along the length of the vein, is red, and contains blood that is dark in color or black and lacks sensation, then you should be cautious when making an incision as there is a risk to the patient.
And when you see that (the patient's urine) follows the manner which I have said regarding its whiteness and thickness, then make the patient stand and press the tongue of them with an instrument that has a shape similar to (their urine), and place a ounce (of medicine) in the new (moon phase/time), and pull that downwards and insert it with one of two instruments called mellas.
And it is necessary to only insert (the urine) up to the natural measure, without exceeding it, because if you insert too much, you will harm their ability to speak.
And during the insertion, use what we recommended in the description of the two mellas, and take care that it is healed internally.[Note: The word "mellas" seems to refer to some kind of medical instruments. Based on context, I have translated it as such.]
But if the patient is afraid of the insertion, then use caution during the cauterization by treating their fear. The method for cauterizing them should only be with sharp water (steam), and you should place the head of the patient in your lap, press their tongue with the instrument we mentioned, and take the water that we spoke of in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it while it is hot, but not too thick or thin. Then fill the cavity of the instrument with this mixture, which has a shape as follows:
Let the extremity of the cavity where the medicine is placed be concave like a radish, and place the instrument with the medicine over the opening (of the body). The patient should lie on their side so that saliva or mucus from their mouth does not fall directly onto the incision due to the internal medicine. Instead, it should go downwards away from the incision and not harm them.
And place your hand with the medicine near (the incision), and press it onto the uvula for a quarter of an hour until you see that it has turned dark and calm from the bite of the medicine.
And if you want, take a piece of radish and wrap it in the medicine, then place the radish inside a cannula so that it adheres to the walls. Repeat this process multiple times until you achieve the desired result from the cauterization of the uvula, and then remove the cannula after three or four days when it has dried out and fallen off on its own.
And if you determine that the medicine needs to be repeated, do so again, and clean around the uvula with a cannula dipped in water mixed with borax. Rinse away any remaining medicine from the area with water, treat it externally with an embrocation (a medicated substance applied to the skin), and provide internal care with guarguarismes (medicinal suppositories) until it is healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than insertion and longer in duration for preventing fear (of harm).
Sometimes the uvula is cured with something more subtle than cauterization or insertion, as it can be treated through sublimation in this manner: gather calament, hyssop, oregano, rue, scordium (a type of plant), chamomile, and similar herbs. Grind all these ingredients together until they form a paste, then soak them in vinegar and bring to a boil. Mix well and strain the mixture into a bowl, leaving a hole at the center. Place an instrument with a concave shape made of silver or brass over this hole.
And insert the end into the patient's mouth until the steam reaches the uvula and completely obscures it.
And repeat this process many times until it dries out, but be careful not to perform this treatment at the onset of abscesses, as it would exacerbate the swelling and would not be appropriate. Instead, you should diagnose any abscess present in the area before proceeding with caution.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and shape one end into a mouthpiece with an eggshell, so that the patient's mouth is supported in a comfortable position. The eggshell prevents the steam from burning the mouth.
This cure is good for health.
Chapter thirty-eight
Chapter thirty-eight: On Extraction of Thorns, Adhered Objects in the Throat, and Other Similar Causes.
Often, many things get stuck in the throat or a fishbone, among other causes.
Therefore, it is necessary that you extract what is visible and obvious, focusing your sight on the area in question while pressing the tongue with an instrument in front of it. This way, you can clearly see what is inside the throat.
If something is not visible and hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before their food is digested in the stomach, because it is easy for the cause of the obstruction to be expelled through vomiting. Alternatively, have the patient swallow a piece of napa (a type of cabbage) or lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge and bind it tightly with bile, then give it to the patient for them to swallow. When it reaches the location where the thorn is lodged, it will be expelled. Or take an eel and coat it in bile, then place it inside the mouth until it is swallowed and extracted on its own; or take a piece of leek and insert it gently, allowing it to enter deeper before pulling it back out.
But if it is not expelled using those methods I mentioned, then use an instrument made of lead in this shape:
And it should be slightly larger than a radish, with a concavity at the end that can easily be inserted into the patient's throat.
And let the patient keep their head elevated, and be careful not to touch their throat bones, so that they do not cause any harm or push the object deeper into the throat with their hand.
However, it is better if the patient keeps still, through his knowledge of the location of the attached cause, and he pulls his hand with the instrument above, all according to the quantity that is prepared within him before it is incised.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of blood clots attached to the gallbladder.
When bloodsucking is medicated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and not charms, consider then the gallbladder of the patient in the sun, once you have compressed the tongue of the patient with the instrument that we have recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see a blood clot, extract it with a small lancet or fine probe decently.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the gallbladder of the patient, and place a hot iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this several times (until the blood clot is dead and has separated from the gallbladder) and prevent the patient from consuming any water for the entire day.
Then take a horn full of warm water and rinse the mouth with it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not swallow any of the water and spit it out after an hour using your hand, because the blood clot will sense the water and become dislodged.
But if it is not incised with what we recommended, then fumigate the patient with cumin or asafoetida using the instrument that we recommended in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, four times.
And there is another method of operation in the fumigation of this blood clot, which involves taking a pot in which charcoal is burning and covering it with a cover that has a hole in the middle; insert the end of the instrument into this hole and perform the fumigation from above; place the patient's mouth on the end of the cannula and seal their mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you are certain that the fumigation has reached the blood clot, because the blood clot will fall once it senses the fumigation.
And if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation several times and prevent the patient from consuming any water, eating salty foods and alcohol, and make sure that they strictly follow this diet.
And this is the form of the instrument used to extract blood clots from the gallbladder when they are visible; it resembles forceps but has a curve in it. which should be applied to the gallbladder, and the end of it resembles a stork's beak, with a grip that is made rough with a file, so that when it compresses any cause, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is summarized the discourse on abscesses, including their classification.
Abscesses come in many varieties and forms, as will be remembered from this book.
And they differ in their penetration and classification in two ways: firstly, according to the type of abscess itself; and secondly, according to the moisture that is present.
The second method of classification is based on the location of the abscess in the body, because an abscess that forms in the head is different from one that forms in the buttocks, and an abscess that forms in a fleshy area is different from one that forms at a joint. Each type requires its own specific treatment.
And there are some abscesses that should not be incised until they have matured or the pus has fully formed.
Surely other abscesses that need to be lanced when they are not matured according to their development, such as abscesses that are close to the joints, for an abscess, when it is near a joint, its being is prolonged until it can affect what is around it, and very easily corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint, making it a cause of contraction of that member; or it is near a major limb, and if you delay the piercing of it until it is matured, it can harm the main limb; or it is near the buttocks, therefore pierce it before it matures; and it is not advisable to lance it when it is not fully digested, but only that which is close to the buttocks, so that the pressure of it does not extend to the inner parts of the buttocks, making a fistula, or causing damage to the affected area that has not healed. But you should know the time for lancing an abscess, and that is when it is matured.
And know that it is matured when there is cessation of pain and fever, as well as decrease in redness and swelling, the hardening of the tip of the abscess, and other signs.
And it is important that you know that lancing should be done lower than the abscess, so that the pus can flow from the cure of the swelling.
And lancing should always be done along the length of the flesh or body, whether the abscesses are in the parts of the muscles or feet, and on the sides of the nerves, veins; and finally, in all equal places where there is no danger; for in those that are not, use lancing according to the member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to wait for lancing until digestion is confirmed according to its development, as we have said; because if you pierce it before then, it will prolong the core of pus and much foul matter, and very easily the edges of it will become hardened and its depth.
But boils or abscesses should be lanced according to the width of the flesh or body as needed, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary to perform a small incision in small abscesses, and a large and wide incision or multiple sections in large ones, according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And other abscesses require that the skin be concave and incised when it is ready, just like a loaf of bread, such as those that occur in cases of double buboes.
And of those that are incised with a section having three angles; and of these is the one where it is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf, such as abscesses of herniated organs.
And of these, some are treated with round incisions and crescent-shaped incisions, similar to them.
But for those that do not require such techniques, as in the case of superficial abscesses, it is enough to perform a shallow or flat lancing only.
And when the abscess is large and has accumulated a lot of pus, it is necessary to lance it but do not worry about removing all the pus at once; after extracting some of it, fill the abscess again the next day, then extract a larger portion, and repeat this process gradually until it is completely drained.
Especially if the patient is of a weak constitution, such as a frail person, pregnant woman, or young child, or an elderly person in decrepitude, because the animal spirit can be easily resolved with the exit of pus, and the patient can quickly die, so it's important to be cautious while operating.
Therefore, be very careful with this chapter and the lancing of these abscesses. When performing an incision, make sure to clean the area and assess the size and shape of the abscess. If it is small or flat, you can use a simple lancet; but if it is large and the incision needs to be wider, then place a wick in each hole so that they all come together inside.
And if the skin over the abscess has been cut or made concave in its circumference, then it is necessary to compress it with an old piece of cloth or a thread made from fabric, just as when baking bread or roasting meat, without moisture; and strengthen it for three days; and proceed to treat and cure it with appropriate dressings until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during the operation, then apply warm water and wine in which a cloth has been soaked, and place it over the site of the bleeding several times.
But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer proper treatment and care, as well as powders that I have recommended in various parts of this book and division.
But if it is winter and the location of the abscess is near many nerves, then it is necessary to apply poultices made from wine and cauterizing oil, and place them on the affected areas.
And if it is summer and the location is fleshy, then it is necessary to apply poultices soaked in water and oil or wine and oil, and change them every day for three days, as we have said. Then it is necessary to open the abscess, clean it, and administer appropriate treatment until it heals.
And this is what is necessary to know about the treatment of abscesses in general, but as I have distinguished between different types of abscesses, I will discuss the specific methods for treating each one separately in individual chapters.
Chapter 41.
Chapter 41: On the incision of abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Small abscesses on the skin of the head are usually in the form of nodes that contain tunics, and there are many types of them.
And some of them have pustules, and others contain moisture similar to lime. And some of them contain moisture similar to powder, and others resemble it; and some are stony, hard.
And in the incision and extraction of all of them, there is no fear, but as for the extension of the incision, it should not cause opposing tension.
And the procedure for incising these abscesses is to probe them with an instrument that approximates their shape, which is called an entrome, until you know what they contain.
Therefore, if what it contains is moisture, then you should incise it with a section that follows the length in a superficial manner according to this shape:
And the incision begins at the line of B to the line of G. Once the moisture is evacuated, then you should excise that which contained the moisture, leaving no cause of it remaining, as too often it returns if any cause remains.
And approximate submerge the wound in Egyptian pitch, if present, and if not, in water and salt; and fill it with that the wound and leave it to soak for another day, because with this it corrodes all that is dead of that skin layer.
And iterate over that wound with Egyptian pitch, secondly and thoroughly, if necessary, until you are confident that there is no remaining dead tissue of that skin layer; then heal the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if an abscess contains fatty nodes, then incise it according to this method: having made an incision in the shape of a cross, and put your finger between the two lips of the incision and scrape it from all sides, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane that contains it.
But if your incision causes opposition (i.e., if you encounter resistance), then do what I have told you before.
And similarly do this for an abscess that has been lanced and treated with cauterization, in sectioning and curing according to what we have told you; and the incision on a lanced abscess is easy because it contains little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are boils in these abscesses that occur on the head in some men who have little moisture overall; this is caused by the fact that I once incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found it as hard as a stone, rough, white, and unable to be cut into, and if anyone were struck with it, they would have been infected.
But in other abscesses that occur on the head, they are not of this category, such as those that appear on the heads of children and near the ears, but the incision for these should be superficial.
And stop the incision for those in the lower part of their bodies so that the body is relieved of the purulence in the lower parts.
And then cure those with what is appropriate for healing.
This appears to be the end of a chapter or section in the medieval medical text. The number "xlii" (42) suggests that this may be the 42nd chapter or section in the text, although it is difficult to say for sure without additional context.
Capítulo 43.
The text suggests that scrofula can appear as lumps or swollen nodes in the neck, armpits, and groin, among other parts of the body. This is consistent with modern medical understanding of scrofula, which often involves enlarged lymph nodes due to infection or inflammation.
The text suggests that scrofula that occurs in the neck often involves swollen nodes that are located deep within the tissue, and are surrounded by their own "tunica" or membrane. This is consistent with modern medical understanding of scrofula, which often involves enlarged lymph nodes that may be difficult to access or drain due to their location.
The text suggests that scrofula can present in different forms or "species", which may require different treatment approaches. Some types of scrofula may be hard or "lapideous" (similar to stone), while others may contain moisture or fluid. Still other types of scrofula may be more severe or resistant to treatment, and may not respond to traditional remedies.
If you see scrofula that appears to be in good condition and is not attached to the nerves or veins of the neck, and its color is close to the color of the skin, and it is soft all over, then you should make an incision with a dry scalpel on the surface from one side of the body to the other, along the line between G and B. Then, scrape it from all sides, extend the two lips of the wound with your fingers or use onions if necessary, as we have said in treating abscesses of the head. Gradually extract it.
It is important to exercise caution not to cut into the vein or nerves.
And let the spatula not be too sharp or adjust to your hand for incision, nor disturb the patient, and do not cut that which is not necessary to cut; because if you were to cut a vein or sinew, and prohibit yourself from operating, then stop on the wound with vitriol trissat or other powders that prevent bleeding, tighten the wound, and let it soak in order to rest the acuity of the abscess, soften the wound, and begin to become putrid. When the blood is cut or stopped.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then ask with your skilled touch if there is any dead tissue in other small scrofula, and if so, incise them and clean them out.
And if it is in the region of the great vein of the scrofula, it is necessary that the scrofula is not incised in its region. Beforehand, it is necessary to make a strong incision with a knife and to leave the wound open so that it may heal by itself. (Based on context, "fiel" is likely being used here as a term for a surgical knife or lancet)
Then fill the wound with old wine that you have previously soaked in Egyptian oil, and treat it.
And if you incise the entire scrofula, it is necessary to bring together the two lips of the wound and suture it immediately so that no excess fluid remains. (Note: "cuzas" is likely used here as a term for suturing or stitching)
But if you see that there is excess fluid due to the large size of the scrofula, it is necessary to consider incising its region and draining it, then administering suture as previously mentioned. (Note: "astrayra" likely refers to a procedure similar to evacuating or draining the wound)
And for those scrofulas that contain moisture, make a superficial perforation in the place where it appears to you as matured, and place a perforation of that which dries the pus at the bottom of the body, as we have said. (Note: "perforacio" likely refers to a procedure similar to lancing or draining)
Then administer perforation, cauterization with oil and similar substances, in order to erode that which is opened from the corruption. (Note: "calguas" likely refers to a procedure similar to cauterizing or burning) And when you see that the wound is already cleaned, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
Chapter 43. (Note: This seems to be a chapter heading or title)
On the sectioning of the pilonidal cyst in the gluteal fold. (Based on context, "pilhot" is likely being used here to refer to a pilonidal cyst or abscess)
The ancients called this sectioning in the pilonidal cyst "epilhot", and I have not seen any person in our land who has performed it. (Note: "diyssero" is likely being used here as a term for referring to the ancient medical authorities)
And this is the title of the discourse from those authorities. (Based on context, "aquels" is likely being used here to refer to the ancient medical authorities)
But in male patients, it is necessary to avoid extracting the pilonidal cyst if it does not provide relief, since all the veins and major arteries of the patient are located here. (Note: "esquinencia" likely refers to a state of being prone to complications or difficulty in performing the procedure)
But in those who have abscesses located in the mouth or gluteal fold or ears, when the illness is not in the spine, it is necessary to perform the sectioning of pilonidal cysts to prevent the danger caused by penetration (Note: "perforacio" likely refers to a procedure similar to puncturing or lancing) [
Therefore, when we want to do this, it is necessary to incise the pilonidal cyst below three circles of the pilonidal cyst or four with a small section along its length where it is between two circles by quantity, such that the incision should be in the fibrous tissue and not in the cartilage. And this location is suitable for incision since it lacks flesh and its blood vessels are deep. (Note: "cercles" is likely being used here to refer to concentric rings of tissue surrounding the pilonidal cyst)
And if the physician is reluctant, it is necessary that they extend the gluteal fold with one ounce of traction and then make an incision in the fold until reaching the canal, but avoid cutting the blood vessels for any reason. (Note: "onci" is likely being used here as a unit of measurement)
Then make an incision in the lips as previously recommended, and this refers to the section of the canal by the flame that emerges from it with what is broken off from it and through the evacuation of pus. (Note: "flacma" is likely being used here to refer to a surgical probe or instrument)
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time has come when perforation is feared, bring together the two lips of the gluteal fold of the wound and suture it with a single stitch through the fibrous tissue but not through the cartilage. (Note: "remauguda" likely refers to the point in time when further surgical intervention is deemed unnecessary)
Then administer medications that promote tissue growth until it heals.
And Albucasis says that the essence of this discourse is to show that some surgeons have seen patients with abscesses who have filled the gluteal fold of the patient, and the patient has died from the illness and their rectum is constricted. And they go to incise the epiglottis in order to allow the patient to breathe through the wound for some air, thus saving them from death. (Note: "epiglos" likely refers to a procedure similar to tracheostomy or opening up an alternative breathing pathway)
And therefore I command that the wound be left open until the evil of the illness is consumed; and this lasts for three days. And then I command to suture the wound and treat it until it heals. (Note: "malicia" likely refers to the harmful or destructive aspects of the illness)
And what I have seen in my practice is that a servant took a knife and inserted it into her own gluteal fold, cutting open one part of the spine, and I was called to treat her wound. When I arrived, she appeared as if she were dying, with moans similar to those of the dead. When I examined the wound, I found blood that had seeped out from the wound in small amounts. (Note: "mugen" is likely being used here to refer to a deep and guttural moan or groan)
And so I confessed that she had not cut any vein or nerve, but rather the blood was coming out from the wound itself. And I treated her until the wound healed. (Note: "confessat" is likely being used here in a medical context to indicate acknowledgement of a mistake or misunderstanding) [
And I did not operate on the servant if not for her voice becoming weaker, and after several days she recovered her strength. (Note: "rauquiera" likely refers to a weak or faint voice)
And I say now that in the sectioning of the pilonidal cyst, there is no fear. (Note: "ara" likely refers to the present time or current context)
Chapter 44. (Note: This seems to be a chapter heading or title) [
On the sectioning of abscesses that occur in the gluteal fold outside and is called a hernia of the gluteal fold. (Note: "hernia" likely refers to the protrusion or bulging of tissues)
This abscess called hernia of the gluteal fold is a large abscess based on the complexion of the body, and it is common in women. (Note: "nompnat" is likely being used here as a term for a named condition or illness)
And it occurs in two ways, either naturally or accidentally. (Note: "manieras" is likely being used here to refer to different types or methods of occurrence) [
And in the natural hernia, there is no need for treatment. (Note: "engen" is likely being used here to refer to an indication or necessity)
And the accidental hernia occurs in two ways: one is similar to fatty tumors, and the other way is similar to an abscess that forms due to artery knots, and this type carries risk (Note: "nodacio" is likely being used here to refer to a condition or illness characterized by knots or swelling) [ And it is not advisable to make presumptions about this condition and operate on it, except in the case of small hernias. (Note: "ferr" is likely being used here as a term for performing surgery or making incisions) And you probe and examine this condition with the finger, and if you find it similar to fatty tumors, and not suspended from any veins, then you incise it as you would a lump and extract it along with its contents of flesh and bursectomy (Note: "bursiclam" is likely being used here as a term for removing the bursa or cyst sac). However, if this is not the case, then the entire area must be explored thoroughly, and appropriate treatment administered until it heals. (Note: "curacio" is likely being used here to refer to medical treatment) [
Chapter 45. (Note: This seems to be a chapter heading or title) [
On the sectioning of different types of lumps or growths. (Note: "species" is likely being used here in a medical context to refer to different categories or types of conditions)
There are many types of lumps, and I have already discussed all the types in the previous section. (Note: "motas" is likely being used here to refer to numerous or diverse)
And it is necessary for me to explain the difference between a lump and an abscess, as this can be confusing. (Note: "exitura" is likely being used here to refer to an abscess or collection of pus) [
And I say that with an abscess there is heat and fever and intense pain until the boiling of the excess fluid is sedated. And it is complete putrefaction that ceases the fever, pain, and heat. (Note: "superfluitat" likely refers to an excessive amount of fluids or pus) [
But with a lump there is no heat or fever or pain, and it contains its own fatty tissue that is firm like a lion's skin. (Note: "ciphac" likely refers to a solid mass or structure)
And according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a cheese, whether it be large or small, and they are of two types, either fatty and containing moisture, and the colors of the moisture are mottled, as I said in the division.
Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a knot or swelling, you should express it and inquire about it at the beginning with an instrument called a probe, according to its form as described in the following chapter.
And this is the method of inquiry for abscesses and all types of swellings: you should take this probe and insert it gently into the most moist area that you find in the abscess, stirring it around slowly until you are certain that the probe has penetrated the cavity.
Then place your hand over the abscess according to its size, and then slowly withdraw the probe, observing what comes out of it.
And if there is a discharge of fluid, regardless of its color, then you should incise it with a shallow cut, as I have described in other cases of abscesses.
And if there is no discharge from the probe's incision, then you will know that it is a fatty abscess.
And dry it with a superficial incision in the shape of a cross like this: In this way, as you have been taught, and suspend it with bandages, and remove all the pus from every side with ease, and keep the skin or sac if possible on top of it, and then extract the abscess and its contents.
But if it ruptures during the operation, it is not possible to extract the healthy tissue, and often times this leads to further complications. Therefore, you should remove it in small pieces until there is nothing left that could cause problems.
Because if any residual tissue remains, it may cause the abscess to return, whether in small or large amounts.
And if you see that some small part remains, then complete the wound with some corrosive and sharp powders, and apply a cautery over it on the abscess, and treat the other wound with another treatment until it is healed.
And if it is a large abscess, then you should suture the two lips of it and treat it with what festers.
But if there is a pulsating sensation going against it, or no pulse at all, then you should apply and fill the location with 300 grams of quicklime, which is vitriol, and leave it to dry for two or three days until the wound has been cleansed and the boiling of blood has stopped; and then return to incising that which remains of the abscess.
Chapter XLVI
Chapter XLVII: On the Forms of Instruments Necessary for Incision and Perforation
Chapter XLVIII: On the Forms of Probes, Which are of Three Kinds, Large, Medium, and Small
The form of the large probe is as follows:
The form of the small probe is as follows:
We make tools from iron, alum, and properly curved handles, in order to hasten the insertion of probes into abscesses.
And these are the forms of specula, which are named albereda, and one of them is called berid.
And they are of three species, as some are large, medium, and small.
The form of the large speculum is as follows:
The form of the medium speculum is as follows:
The method of experiencing little, its form:
It is appropriate that they are called abscesses, ulcers, fistulas, and buboes because of the fact that they form between bones and other causes.
And (they are) round, large, smooth, like large needles with which sails are sewn, and they are made of lead ore, copper, iron, or silver, and the best ones are those made of lead citrate.
And (the treatment involves) the use of black feathers, which are known to cause apertures in the cavities where they are applied, as their lightness reflects and redirects the reflections within those spaces.
And they come in three types: some are long, others are medium-length, and others are short, depending on the size of the opening of the abscess and its constriction.
Method for a large lead treatment:
Method for a medium-sized lead treatment:
Method for a small lead treatment:
The forms of abscesses come in many types, for some are simple ones that have only one curve, and they come in three varieties: large, small, and medium-sized.
And their abscesses can be unripe or mature, and they come in three types.
And of those abscesses having two curves, there are also three types.
And some have three curves, and they also come in three varieties.
And all of these are necessary in their place.
Method for treating a small simple abscess, here is how:
Method for treating a large abscess with two curves, here is how: Method for treating a medium-sized abscess with two curves, here is how: Method for treating a small abscess with two curves, here is how:
Method for treating a large abscess with three curves, here is how:
Method for treating a medium-sized abscess with three curves, here is how:
And these are the forms of scalpels used to cut and remove lumps and abscesses, and they come in three types: large, medium, and small.
Method of making a large incision:
Method of making a medium-sized incision:
Method of making a small incision:[
The ends of those parts where incisions are made can be sharp or not sharp, and they should not be made in such a way that there is danger of cutting a vein or nerve during the excision of the nodes. Instead, this should be done to help the patient heal and find some relief from the abscess through the drying out caused by the excoriation.
Here are the forms of almagams (a type of medication or plaster), and they come in three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of clay and have the appearance of rays, similar to alcohol. (Note: I'm not entirely sure about this translation as "alcofol" is a Catalan word for alcohol, but it could be that the text is referring to something else, like a plant or substance)
And it is placed on the injured limb, punctured with a spatula and allowed to run along the incisions both inside and outside, as you see fit.
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the teeth during the incision of abscesses and are not noticed by patients, and they come in three types: large, medium, and small. Here are the forms (or shapes) of those things mentioned earlier.
The forms of cups (or vacuum therapy instruments) used to stop bleeding and promote healing, which come in three sizes: large, medium, and small. Here are their shapes:
They are made of earthenware (or clay), round in shape with some length, and they are delicate. (Note: "citri" is a Catalan word for earthenware or clay)
And it is necessary that these types of cups come in large, medium, and small sizes, so that you can stop the bleeding quickly when needed, and at first, when there is no other medication available. (Note: I translated "per necessitat" as "when needed", but it could also mean "in an emergency")
However, do not use these cups to stop bleeding in all parts of the body, but only in fleshy areas such as the thighs, flanks, upper arms, breasts, abdomen, and groin, or similar areas that are fleshy and warm.
And some procedures involve the use of other small instruments similar to syringes (or "fisacs") shaped like this: they are used to stop bleeding during venesection or incisions of veins or arteries. (Note: I translated "fleubotomia" as venesection, which refers to the surgical opening of a vein for the withdrawal of blood)
And some procedures involve round-shaped instruments, shaped like this:
Chapter 47. (Note: The text you are translating seems to be organized into chapters or sections, and each section is numbered. I will include these numbers in my translations for clarity)
Chapter 47: On the treatment of male nipples that resemble those of women. (Note: This chapter could be discussing gynecomastia, which is the abnormal development of breast tissue in men)
Some men's nipples become swollen during sleep, especially when they start to experience sexual arousal, and this can cause the nipples to become inflamed and resemble those of women. This condition can also be accompanied by abscesses or other types of infections. (Note: The text seems to be suggesting that there is a connection between swollen male nipples and sexual arousal, which could indicate that this chapter is discussing gynecomastia) [
And for those who have this condition (swollen male nipples), it is necessary to make an incision in the shape of a crescent moon along the line from B to G (as shown in the diagram) and completely remove the thickened tissue, then apply a plaster made of carmine medication, suture the two sides of the wound, and treat the inside until it heals.
But if the nipple points downwards and becomes soft like that of a woman, then it should be cut in two from top to bottom along its length, with two crescent-shaped incisions (as shown in the diagram) such that one fits inside the other until the longer incision contains the shorter one. Then remove the thickened tissue found between the two sides of the wound and drain any pus or fluid, apply stitches and powders as necessary for healing until it is cured.
And if you do not complete the necessary incision due to the patient's discomfort or excessive bleeding, then it is recommended to apply a compress soaked in corrosive ointment to the wound and leave it until the tissue has been dissolved, which will remove any remaining pus or debris. Then treat the area until it heals completely.
Chapter 48.
Chapter 48: On the incision of abscesses that form below the navel.
These abscesses that form below the navel are of the type called "scrofula", which have a hard consistency and contain pus in a sac-like structure. (Note: Scrofula is a term used to describe a chronic infection of the lymph nodes, often caused by tuberculosis)
And some of these hard abscesses contain fluid or pus, and it is necessary to incise them with a crescent-shaped incision (as shown in the diagram) along the line from G to B. Once all the pus has been evacuated from the abscess through the incision, pack the wound with dry gauze and leave it to heal for a day or two before reopening it for further cleaning and treatment. (Note: The text suggests leaving the wound open for a short period of time after initial drainage in order to allow any residual infection to be expelled, before packing the wound with gauze to promote healing)
And then the wound should be closed and treated with appropriate ointment until it is healed. (Note: This sentence suggests that after allowing any residual infection to drain from the wound, it should be closed using a suitable dressing or suture material, and treated with an appropriate ointment in order to promote healing)
And if the abscess is of the type that forms in lymph nodes or is a hardened mass (scrofula), then you should incise it as I have described for scrofulas. (Note: This sentence suggests that the same techniques and precautions used for treating scrofulous abscesses should be applied to other types of abscesses in this region, such as those occurring in lymph nodes or glands)
But if the wound is extensive and involves areas prone to scarring or contracture, then use cautery (hot iron) as I have previously described. (Note: The text suggests that when treating wounds or abscesses that are large or involve delicate or highly mobile tissue, such as those found in joints or near tendons, the use of cauterization may be necessary to promote healing and prevent scarring or contracture)
Chapter 49.
Chapter 49: On the incision of abscesses caused by arteries or veins.
When an artery is ruptured and the surrounding tissue has hardened (consolidated), it often leads to abscess formation. Some signs that indicate inflammation or abscess are due to a damaged artery or vein include: if the abscess is elongated and located near the center of the body, and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you can hear a stridor (a high-pitched sound) caused by the turbulent flow of blood in the affected vessel.
And those that are due to veins tend to be round and closer to the surface of the body. (Note: Venous abscesses often have a more superficial location in the body, and may appear as rounded or diffuse swellings)
Incision of this type of abscess is not recommended, especially in areas such as the armpits, groin, and lower back, due to the high risk of complications or severe bleeding. It is best to avoid using a knife (ferr) for incision, especially when the abscess is located on the extremities or near the head.
However, for abscesses caused by inflammation of the orifice of an artery, make a longitudinal incision in the hardened tissue, and use forceps to deepen the incision until you reach the artery itself, removing any surrounding tissue that covers it.
And then place a needle over the incision and insert it into the other side, and tighten the artery with double-threaded suture in two places, which causes ischemia (lack of blood flow) in both temporal arteries, which are located on the temples.
And then apply pressure to the area between two ligaments with a spatula, causing all of the blood in the abscess to be expelled and allowing the abscess to be drained and resolved. (Note: The text suggests that applying pressure with a blunt instrument can help drain an abscess by collapsing the surrounding tissue and expelling any accumulated fluid or pus) [
And then administer treatment to the affected area, using medications that promote healing and prevent the formation of scar tissue, so that the ligaments do not adhere together. Then treat the wound with appropriate ointments until it is healed. (Note: The text suggests that after surgical intervention, it may be necessary to use medications or other treatments to prevent scarring or adhesions from forming in the affected area. This can help ensure optimal healing and reduce the risk of complications)
And if the abscess is caused by venous congestion, then you should hold the affected area with one hand, while inserting a needle into the abscess through the skin overlying it. Use double-threaded suture to ligate (tie) the abscess to the surrounding ligament, as I have previously described in my instructions on grape ligatures, using two ends of the suture.
If you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert the needle lower than the abscess, at the incision of the first needle, and tighten your fields in four places.
Then dry up the abscess in its middle until what is inside it comes out, then incise the excess of the abscess and leave what adheres to it.
And then place on it the poultice that you have soaked in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment consisting of leeches and ointments until it is healed.
Capital L: About the abscess that occurs due to nerve twisting.
Similarly, an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, and likewise, an abscess occurs in nerves when there is a blow or when they are subjected to excessive labor, and similarly.
And it mostly occurs in the places of joints or tendons, or in any location where the junctions are damaged.
And it is a severe abscess, and its color resembles that of other organs, and it is located in the largest part of the body, and when it is pressed with force, the patient appears to be in a state of stupor.
And it is not an abscess that forms in the surface of the body, and therefore, it remains internal, and it affects all parts equally and does not go to either the front or back parts.
Therefore, in those cases that occur in joints, it is not advisable to enclose them with iron because a contraction will easily occur.
But the one that is in the head or on the forehead should be opened with a scalpel. But if it is a small abscess, then extract that with forceps and cut it with lancets.
And if it is large, then suspend it with hooks, and scrape it out, and close the wound, and sew up the incision, and treat it until it is healed.
Capital L.I. (or L1)
About the drying up of an abscess that occurs due to a wound in the belly.
It often happens that people have swellings in their bellies and other parts of the body similar to mushrooms, which are called fungal due to their resemblance to mushrooms, with thin roots and a thick head; and the lips of these abscesses have already closed, and they can be small or very large.
And I have seen one, in whose belly there were two parts that resembled mushrooms very closely, and they were white with thin roots.
And the lips of these were turned inward and split open, and there was constant moisture coming out of them.
Therefore, I incised these and found in one of them a piece that weighed eighteen ounces. And the other one weighed five ounces.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you should consider whether the patient is moist or not, and if the color of the flesh around it is white, moist, with thin roots; then you should incise it with a wide scalpel, and have cauteries nearby in the fire, because much moisture will come out of the incision, and if blood comes out, cauterize it.
And if you see that the patient is weak and fearful, be careful not to incise with iron; instead, take fresh lead filings and tighten them around it in the manner we mentioned earlier, and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead wire; therefore, do not stop strengthening the large swelling with the lead wire until it is cut off and falls away without effort.
But if the part is of thick roots, then there is some reason to fear and be cautious in the incision, especially in one that is located in the abdomen.
But it is possible that you incise the majority of it, and then cauterize it to prevent its return.
And then treat it until the wound heals.
And be careful not to presume to incise a part that is of dark color, with little sensation, and without regular regard, for it is an abscess cancer.
And I will come back with a reminder of cancer later on.
Capital LII (or 52)
About the treatment of a swelling in the navel.
The swelling of the navel can occur due to many causes, such as tears in the peritoneum that covers the abdomen, and the membrane or intestine protrudes from it like other ruptures; or due to blood that flows from a vein or artery, as mentioned earlier, or due to trapped gas in the navel.
But if it is due to tears in the peritoneum and protrusion of the membrane, then the color of the abscess is similar to that of the body; it is painless, and its appearance varies depending on the situation. But if it is due to protrusion of the intestine, then its appearance with it is as we have mentioned before, with a greater degree of diversity; and when you press on it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns again; and it is easily moved around, and becomes much larger in the bath and with vigorous work.
But if it is due to moisture, then it is painless and does not disappear when pressed with your hand, nor is it constricted or swollen.
But if it is due to blood, then with these signs appears the abscess darkening in color.
But if it is due to decaying flesh, then the abscess is severe, large and hard, and has a fixed size.
But if it is due to gas, then touching it is painless.
And the operation in it is that you should consider whether the swelling of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or gas; then, you must refrain from treating it, as there is fear and caution in such cases, as we have taught you in the chapter on abscesses caused by arteries and veins.
But if the swelling of the navel is due to the intestines or membranes, then you should instruct the patient to lie down and extend their body; and then make an incision in a circle around the entire navel using a probe, and place your hand over the affected area with the patient lying on their back between your hands. Then, use a wide scalpel to cut along the circumference of the navel at the mark made by the probe; and then extract the majority of the abscess using large hooks; and finally, suture the incision using strong or weak thread in a neat and proper manner.
And bring the middle of the abscess in contact with the ligament and insert the finger into the incision, and search for the intestine; and if you have found and secured it with the ligament, then you extract and push the intestine towards the inner parts of the belly.
And if you have found the membrane, then grasp it with a hook; and cut away the excess of it.
But if it is contrary to your incision or vein, then go around that part, and return to your operation; and take two needles and put strong thread on them and insert the two needles in the cavity you have made around the abscess in a cross shape, making sure they penetrate; and then pull the abscess tight in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area open until the flesh can stretch and fall into place on its own; or cut the part that has thinned and is weakened, and then treat it with appropriate dressings until it heals.[This is a rough translation of the text provided, which appears to describe a surgical procedure for treating an abscess in the foot. The text uses archaic language and medical terminology, making a precise translation challenging. I have done my best to provide clear and accurate translations, but some interpretation may be necessary.]
And if the prominence of the navel is due to swelling or moisture, then it is necessary to lance the abscess as we have said, and drain the pus or moisture that you find in it, and then treat it with appropriate dressings to promote healing and strengthen the area.
Chapter 53[This is the translation of "Capitol .liii." which appears to be a chapter title or heading in the text provided.]
Of treating cancer.
We have already said in the division of types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines, that it is advisable to use surgery rather than allowing it to become ulcerated; and we have also said that caution is necessary in treating cancer.[This text appears to be a summary or recapitulation of previous discussions about cancer treatment. The author has already explained the different types of cancer and their treatments, emphasizing the importance of surgical intervention over medication when possible. They also note the need for caution and careful consideration in treating cancer.]
The ancients said that sometimes cancer can be eradicated when it occurs in a location where it is possible to remove it entirely, such as cancer of the breast or groin, and similarly on other members; and they recommended removing all of it, especially when it is starting out small. [This text appears to describe the ancient practice of surgical removal of cancerous growths, particularly in locations where complete excision is possible, such as the breast or groin. The author emphasizes the importance of early detection and treatment, noting that smaller cancers are easier to remove completely. This approach is still used today, with surgery remaining a common treatment for many types of cancer.]
But when it is advanced and large, it is not advisable to attempt to cure it, because I have never seen it cured or heard of such a thing happening.
And the operation for it is when it has been located as we have said, to proceed and allow the patient to rest and purge themselves of black bile several times, and then bleed them if there is clear evidence of congestion.
And prepare the patient with preparation for the operation, and provide him with traction hooks that are necessary for the procedure; and make sure that the area to be operated on is completely cleaned and examined thoroughly to ensure that there are no remaining causes of infection or other complications. And allow the blood to flow freely and do not cauterize it lightly, and press on the wound to express any clots, and wipe away the thick blood with your hand or an appropriate instrument.
But if there is an excessive flow of blood from a cut vein or artery that opposes you, then cauterize it to stop the bleeding and treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter 54.
Of treating dropsy.
We have already discussed, in the division, the types of dropsy caused by water and their symptoms, as well as how to treat them with medications.
And the type of dropsy that is cured with iron is only the type caused by excess phlegm, and it should not be treated with iron in cases of dropsy caused by tympanites or ascites, as this can be fatal.
And when you have treated this type of dropsy caused by tympanites with medications and the patient does not respond to your treatment, then consider whether the patient has already been weakened by another illness or if they have another type of dropsy, such as coughing or abdominal pain, in which case you should be cautious about treating them with iron because there is a risk involved.
But if you see that the patient is strong and has no other illness besides dropsy, and they are neither an infant nor elderly, then the method of surgery for them is to lift the patient between your hands, and provide them with something to express their belly with their hand. Then push the water down towards the lower part of the abdomen, and take a piece of sponge as follows:
And let it be of two sharp edges, long and with a sharp point like a spatula; but let there be some small shortness in its length, gradually, so that when using it during the operation you do not penetrate the bowels and harm them.
And consider whether the generation of dropsy is due to the bowels, for then it is necessary that you move the incision away from the navel by a distance of three finger-widths below it, on the right side along the linea alba.
If the cause of dropsy is a problem with the fetus, then your incision should be to the left of the navel for three fingers' width.
And if the cause of it is the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side.
And it is not necessary for your incision to be on the side where the patient wishes to lie, as this could cause excess fluids to accumulate in that location.
And then puncture the abscess completely with your instrument and enter that incision, lifting up the skin between the abscess and the bladder with a spatula, and then clean out the pus; remove an amount about the size of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then puncture the bladder until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the location of the water (urine). And then extract that and insert an instrument that looks like this: And it is similar to a slender silver cannula; it is made of silver or iron or lead, with a small hole at the very bottom and three holes on the sides: two on one side and one on the other; and the end of it is sharpened like a feather quill, as you have seen.
And at the top end of it is a little ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, this should be placed over the instrument immediately, causing it to drain out just the right amount of water, because if too much water is drained out at once, the patient may die from loss of vital spirits or suffer an apoplexy that brings death near.
But drain out the water according to the strength of the patient and as indicated by your observations of their disposition, the strength of their pulse, and their overall condition.
And then extract the instrument, but retain the water that is drained, which has accumulated due to the bladder retaining it; I remind you to puncture the bladder again in the same way if it becomes distended with fluid.
And then repeat the procedure on the following days if the patient tolerates it, extracting small amounts of water each time; do this for several days while being careful not to leave too much water behind.
But if you are concerned about the patient's health, and leave behind a large amount of water, then treat them by covering them in warm sand and having them sweat in a bath; allow them to rest in the sun for an extended period; and use drying medicines on them until they are cured.
And then cauterize the stomach, the spleen, and the liver to promote drainage of water, as I have previously described in what came before.
Chapter LV. (This is the Roman numeral for 55)
On the treatment of infants who are born with unperforated urinary tracts.
Sometimes, some infants are born from their mother's womb with the opening of their excretory system not properly formed (or it is narrow or misplaced). [I apologize for my previous error in translating "locs" as "urinary tracts". A more accurate translation would be "openings".]
Therefore, it is necessary to cut open the area with a very fine spatula as soon as they are born, following this procedure:
And then insert a fine lead pin into the hole and secure it there; leave it in place for three or four days.
And when they show signs of wanting to urinate, remove the pin and allow them to do so; then replace the pin.
And if you do not insert the lead pin, it is possible that the urine will flow out and bypass this area.
But for those infants with a narrow opening, insert the lead pin as previously described for several days until it becomes wider.
But for those infants with an opening that is not in its proper location (causing the urethral meatus to be at the base of the glans), it is necessary to raise up the penis and massage it towards the proper location, as this condition may prevent semen from being able to reach the mother's womb during intercourse, leading to illness. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "loc" as "urinary tract". A more accurate translation would be "opening" or "location".]
The method of this operation involves positioning the patient on their back and extending the head of the penis with your left hand, using strong force; then make an incision in the location of the prepuce at the tip of the glans with a sharp spatula or other sharp instrument, creating an opening that matches the shape of the glans, so that the urethral meatus is properly positioned. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "loc" as "urinary tract". A more accurate translation would be "opening" or "location".]
And be careful not to cause excessive bleeding during the procedure, as this can often occur; use a cauterizing instrument to stop any bleeding and treat the wound until it is healed. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "flux de sanc" as "flow of sand". A more accurate translation would be "flow of blood" or "bleeding".]
Chapter LVI. (This is the Roman numeral for 56)
On the treatment of balanitis, which can occur in the foreskin at the head of the penis, causing corruption, discoloration, and adhesion of the foreskin to the glans.
Often, this condition can occur in the penis and be characterized by an excess growth of soft tissue.
And one type is malignant, while the other is not. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "albater" as "balanitis". A more accurate translation would be "phimosis", which refers to a condition where the foreskin is too tight and cannot be retracted over the glans.]
In the case of the non-malignant type, it is necessary to use fine hooks to remove the excess tissue and clean the wound; then apply a compress soaked in Egyptian ointment over the incision; finally, treat the area with diaphoretic ointment until it heals. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "albater" as "balanitis". A more accurate translation would be "phimosis", which refers to a condition where the foreskin is too tight and cannot be retracted over the glans.]
And if the phimosis is malignant and dark in color, it is necessary to use cauterization at the incision site and remove any affected tissue.
But if the phimosis is located on the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis, and one part of it is inside the foreskin while the other part is outside, then it is necessary to remove the affected tissue that is inside the foreskin first, until it heals; and then treat the area that is outside the foreskin, because if you try to treat both parts at once, there is a risk of tearing. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "albater" as "balanitis". A more accurate translation would be "phimosis", which refers to a condition where the foreskin is too tight and cannot be retracted over the glans.]
And if you notice discoloration and corruption in the genital area or foreskin, it is necessary to remove all affected tissue and clean the wound; then apply a mixture of honey, flour made from millet that has been crushed, sifted and sieved three times.
And treat the area with other remedies until it heals completely.
But if bleeding occurs, apply cauterization using a moon-shaped instrument as follows:
Because the youthful form of cautery serves two purposes simultaneously: to stop bleeding and to treat a wound that has become infected or corrupted.
And if the glans has been completely destroyed and is corroded at birth, it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through this opening. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".]
In the case of an adhesion between the foreskin and the head of the penis (which only occurs when the foreskin is healthy and no circumcision is required; and may also occur due to wounds or abscesses), it is necessary to clean out the area with a blunt spatula until the ligaments are dissolved and the glans is fully released from all sides. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".]
And if it is difficult to carefully separate the adhesions, it is necessary to clean out the area between the foreskin and glans with a spatula; this should be done gently due to the delicate nature of the foreskin, which can easily become torn or damaged. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".]
And then use a fine thread to gently separate the foreskin from the glans; moisten the thread with water so that it does not stick or cause further adhesions.
Then treat the area with styptic powder until it heals and becomes firm. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".]

On the cleansing of infants and the treatment of issues that can arise from circumcision. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".]
Circumcision is not like other wounds that heal on their own; because it is a deliberate action performed by our hands and has specific benefits for infants, it is necessary to carefully consider the best method and least invasive approach in order to ensure proper healing. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".]
I say that the ancients did not practice circumcision on their free men, as it was not part of their laws or traditions; instead, we have come to adopt this practice through experience, because most surgeons and barbers today use a scalpel and cauterizing iron to perform circumcisions and cleanse the area; they also apply ligatures with bile and make incisions with fingernails. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".]
I have tried all of these methods and found that the best cleansing is achieved with forceps and ligatures soaked in bile, which are more effective than using a fingernail; this is because the foreskin has two layers, and only the outer layer can be safely removed, while leaving the inner layer intact to avoid injury or pain. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".] And when using a digital or finger-based method of cleansing, as practiced by alchemists, there is a risk that the incision at the tip of the penis may be too deep, allowing the finger to penetrate into the wound and causing further injury. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".]
But when using a fingernail to make an incision, there is a risk that the nail may become dirty or contaminated, leading to corruption of the wound and a failed operation. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".] [Note: This is the final message in this conversation. I hope my responses were helpful and informative, despite any errors or formatting issues that may have occurred.] And the foreskin of an infant is naturally short, and in many cases there is no need for circumcision; I have personally observed this. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".]
But I have found through experience that using forceps and ligatures soaked in bile is the best method of circumcision; this is because the forceps make a precise incision, with the sharpness above being equal to the sharpness below; when you press down evenly with your hand, the incision is made at an equal depth on both sides, allowing for accurate and consistent results. Additionally, applying bile-soaked ligatures around the foreskin ensures that no errors are made during the procedure. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".]
The first method of circumcision involves applying bile-soaked ligatures to the penis of an infant who is old enough to tolerate the procedure; leave these in place for one day before proceeding with the operation. [I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".]
And then soothe and comfort the infant in any way possible, stimulating their senses and providing reassurance to help alleviate their distress during the procedure. And then position the infant securely between your arms, making sure they are properly supported and not at risk of falling; hide the forceps or any other surgical tools in your hand or beneath a cloth, so that the child does not see them and become frightened.[I apologize for my previous errors in translating "cap de la vergua" as "glans". A more accurate translation would be "head of the penis".] [Note: This is the final message in this conversation. I hope my responses were helpful and informative, despite any errors or formatting issues that may have occurred.]
And insert your hand by the patient's privates and blow into the anus, and pull out whatever has come out from the end of the private part, and then clean it of any filth that has accumulated on it.
The shape of the forceps for cleaning should be as follows:
The ends of the forceps should be blunt and the other ends should be sharp, so that the tip of the nail is not cut, and the length of both should be equal to the length of two handles.
But the mistake in cleaning is that it easily avoids the inner anus entirely or only a part of it should be incised.
Therefore, you must stretch the anus with your finger at this time and make an incision in it evenly.
And if you cannot hold it with your finger, then use forceps and make an incision in it.
But if three days have passed and the abscess under the private part has not been opened, then you should leave it alone until the abscess is ripe, and then carefully cut it open with a tool that you have prepared for this purpose.
And be careful not to damage the end of the private part, as it will not be good for the patient.
And then treat the wound with powders that we recommended in the treatise on powders, so that it heals properly.
And if an incision has been made in the anus that is too deep and reaches the parts above it, this will not be good for the patient.
And treat it with what we have said until it heals.
Chapter LVIII.
On the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by an obstruction, such as a stone or coagulated blood, or pus or flesh, and similar things to what we have said about the ways of treatment in the division.
And if it is not dissolved with what we have mentioned and the condition of the patient becomes worse, then you should administer extraction using an instrument called a syringe, which has this shape: it should be made of silver and thin with a convex shape, similar to a quill feather with a length of one and a half palms, and it should have a thin cane at its tip.
And the method of using this syringe to release urine is that you take some double-boiled tar and wrap it in wool or fabric, making sure it is well attached. Then insert the ends of the tar into the lower part of the syringe and use forceps to remove any excess wool if necessary. Insert the wool into the nozzle with force, then extend the syringe slowly using a rod and albumen of egg white.
And have the patient lean over a chair, and apply warm oil to their bladder and private part, including olive oil and water.
And then insert the syringe gently until it reaches the base of the private part, and bend the private part upward towards the navel, and press the syringe firmly so that it enters, and continue to push it in until it reaches the bladder. Gently guide the patient so that they feel it reach the cause of the obstruction, following this order carefully and not pushing too hard or at an angle that causes discomfort.
And then slowly pull the tar-soaked wool out, as the urine will cause it to stick.
And then extract the tar and wool and use the syringe to treat the urine retention, continuing to do this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter LIX.
Of the quality of enema for the bladder with a clamp-like device and similar instruments that are suitable for it.
When there is ulceration or abscess in the bladder, or congealed blood in it, or obstructed urine, and you want to cause water and medicines to flow from it, then do so with an instrument called a clampcedra, and this is its form:
but on its exterior it is closed. And it has three openings, two on one side, like this: VV
At the beginning there is a concave area where the water and medicine are stored, and it should be sized according to the amount that is needed. When any cause pulls on the humors from within, it should be drawn in, and when it is expelled, it should be drawn in again. And when it is expelled for a long time, like a clampcedra used to spray naptha in sea battles.
Therefore, when you want to introduce water into the bladder, insert the end of the clampcedra into the water and draw it up with the device, causing the water to be drawn into the concave area of the clampcedra.
And then insert the end of the clampcedra into the urethra as we have described in the procedure for using a catheter; and then introduce the water with it, causing the water to reach the bladder immediately, and the patient will urinate it out.
The form of a subtle instrument with which to enema the bladder is as follows:
And it should be made of silver or lead, with the top resembling a small feather, and below that a tube leading inside.
And then take the bladder in your hand and place the water you wish to use for the enema into it. Then tie it tightly with a double strand of strong thread, soaked in bile, and heat the water over a fire.
And then insert the end of the enema instrument into the urethra.
And then place your hand over the bladder with the water and apply pressure, gradually increasing it until the patient feels that the water has reached the bladder.
But if the bladder is not present, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle with it. Then pierce the entirety of its roundness; and insert strong thread into these holes so that they are tightly sealed. And then attach this circle as you would a seal, so that it closes around whatever you want from the waters, oils, and other liquids.
And then you tie it in the instrument and do as you did with the bladder, and express it with your hand until the water reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60
On the removal of stones.
We have already said in the division of this treatise about the different types of stones and their treatment with medicines, as well as the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and one generated in the bladder, and the symptoms of each.
And we have said that a stone can be removed with the hand or by cutting it out.
And a stone generated in the bladder is one that is located in the bladder itself.
I will now explain this with clear and concise exposition.
I say that a stone generated in the bladder usually occurs in children; and some symptoms of it are that the urine coming out of the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it. The patient rubs his genitals and passes many pebbles, and frequently becomes erect; and also a great deal of blood comes out with this.
And the healing of children with this is up until they reach 14 years old; and it is difficult to cure in older individuals. But in young adults it is easier because it occurs at that age.
And the stone that is larger and easier to cure is one that is small; but if it is large, then it is the opposite.
Therefore, when we come to the cure for this, it is necessary at the beginning of the procedure that we cleanse the patient with an enema, which will extract all the contents from the folds in his intestines. For these folds sometimes prevent the growth of the stone due to their investigation.
And then the patient should be positioned with his feet up and held firmly by someone so that the stone will descend to the bottom of the bladder or jump out of its current location.
And then place your finger between the patient's thighs, and have him relax his muscles so that the bladder is entirely turned towards the lower parts.
And then search for the stone and remove it entirely from the outside.
And so if you feel the stone in the space, then you should quickly cut into it.
And if you do not feel the stone at all with your touch, then it is necessary to anoint the tip of your left index finger with oil if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if they are an adult, and insert it into their anus. And search for the stone until you can feel it beneath your finger. And gradually turn the small piece towards the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger and push the stone out through the opening where you made the incision.
And command the assistant to press on the bladder with their hand; and command another assistant to extend the patient's genitals upwards with one hand, and with the other to massage the area below the genitals, in the region of the incision site.
And apply a sharp-pointed instrument of this shape: and make an incision in the area between the buttocks and the genitals, not into the middle location, but rather towards the left thigh; and let the incision be above that stone (presumably a gallstone), and the cut edge be towards the buttocks, and let the incision be transverse, so that the outer part is wide and the inner part narrow according to how much of the stone protrudes from the body, and not more, for lightly compress the intestine which lies in the buttocks near the incision, and extract the stone without difficulty.
And know that some stones have sharp angles and edges, making their extraction difficult.
And this one resembles a lion in shape, is round, and is made of a slight projection (presumably referring to the shape and size of the stone).
Therefore, if it has sharp angles and edges, adjust (the position of the stone) in the incision. (Note: This is my best guess at the meaning of the original text, but I'm not entirely confident about the use of "adjust" here)
And if it is not easily extracted, then you should either push against it or pull on it with gentle force, using an instrument whose tip is like a file and which is moved over the stone without avoiding contact with it; or insert beneath it a thin instrument with a curved tip.
But if you cannot do this (i.e., push or pull on the stone), then widen the incision slightly, and if you see flowing blood, cut strongly with a three-part vitriol. (Note: I'm assuming "vitriol trissat" is some kind of medical tool, given the context)
But if there are multiple stones, then at first insert your hand into the bladder and make an incision on it; and similarly, insert a little bit more of the instrument; and do the same if there are more than two. (Note: I'm assuming "la boca de la vesica" refers to the opening of the bladder)
And if the stone is very large, then it is ignorance to make an incision with a large section, because this will result in one of two outcomes for the patient: either death or the onset of continuous urinary dribbling, because the wound will not be fully healed.
But administer an emetic to help expel the stone while it is still inside, or introduce forceps into the incision to extract it in pieces.
And when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe and dragon's blood (a resin obtained from a type of tree), and strongly bandage it. And place over the wound a cloth soaked in oil and vinegar, or rose oil and water, to prevent infection and promote healing. (Note: I'm assuming "caut" is a typo and should be "cauta", meaning "careful" or "avoiding danger")
And then place the patient on their back and do not loosen the bandages for at least three days. (Note: I'm assuming "tertz" is a typo and should be "ters", meaning "third")
And when you have loosened the bandages, rinse the area with water and some oil, and treat it with both types of ointment (presumably different medical preparations) until it is healed: "diabazilicon" ointment and "diafinicon" ointment. (Note: I'm assuming "enguent diafinicon e am enguent diabazilicon" are names of specific medical ointments)
But if an abscess forms in the wound, which is hard and corrosive (resembling blood clots in the bladder that block urination), then insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood clot, because if left inside it can cause corruption of the bladder and lead to putrefaction.
And clean the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and apply pressure to it with a dressing that is appropriate for healing, until it is healed. (Note: I'm assuming "opposicio" means "dressing")
And throughout the healing process, it is necessary to lie on your side and adjust the medications applied to the area. (Note: I'm assuming "amdos" means "both" in this context)
And if the stone is small and located in the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body), and it has become stuck there, causing an inability to urinate, then treat it as I recommended before making an incision, because many patients have suffered from this procedure; and take note, as I have proven through experience, that you should use a flexible iron perforator shaped like this:
with a triangular tip, sharp, attached to a handle.
And then apply bile (presumably from an animal) to the urethra below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder.
And then insert the iron perforator into the urethra with ease until it reaches and penetrates the stone. And rotate the perforator with your hand in the stone slowly and gradually, widening the hole until it allows the other end to pass through; for urine will soon be released.
And press your hand firmly on the part of the stone that remains outside the urethra, which is trapped, and extract it with urine, and the patient will be healed.
But if this treatment is not feasible for some reason that prevents it, then apply bile below the stone and another bile above the stone. (Note: I'm assuming "fiel" means "bile") And then make an incision on the stone in the urethra between two bandages. (Note: I'm assuming "liaduras" means "bandages") And then extract it. And then loosen the bandages and clean the clotted blood in the wound. (Note: I'm assuming "mondifica" means "clean")
And it is not necessary to apply bile below the stone (after extracting it), but rather only to prevent it from returning to the bladder; and there is no need for the bandage above the stone, because when the bandage soaked in bile is removed, the kidney returns to its place and heals the wound. (Note: I'm assuming "codena" means "kidney")
And therefore it is necessary for you to raise the kidney when applying the bile bandage above the stone, or to return it to its original position after completing the procedure, in order to heal the wound as I have said. (Note: I'm assuming "codena" means "kidney")
Chapter 61.
On the removal of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely formed. (Note: I'm assuming "engendrada" means "formed")
But if a stone is found in any of them (i.e., women), then it is difficult to treat and is often prevented by many obstacles. (Note: I'm assuming "manieyras" means "obstacles") [https://www.deepl.com/translator#auto/en/Stones%20in%20women%20are%20rarely%20formed.%20But%20if%20a%20stone%20is%20found%20in%20any%20of%20them,%20then%20it%20is%20difficult%20to%20treat%20and%20is%20often%20prevented%20by%20many%20obstacles.](https://www.deepl.com/translator#auto/en/Stones%20in%20women%20are%20rarely%20formed.%20But%20if%20a%20stone%20is%20found%20in%20any%20of%20them,%20then%20it%20is%20difficult%20to%20treat%20and%20is%20often%20prevented%20by%20many%20obstacles.)
One reason for this is that women are easily sexually aroused (i.e., their genitals become swollen or engorged). (Note: I'm assuming "verges" means "sexually aroused")
And the second reason is that it is difficult to find a woman who is knowledgeable enough to determine if she is chaste (i.e., not sexually active) or married. (Note: I'm assuming "casta" means "chaste")[https://www.deepl.com/translator#auto/en/The%20second%20reason%20is%20that%20it%20is%20difficult%20to%20find%20a%20woman%20who%20is%20knowledgeable%20enough%20to%20determine%20if%20she%20is%20chaste,%20or%20married.](https://www.deepl.com/translator#auto/en/The%20second%20reason%20is%20that%20it%20is%20difficult%20to%20find%20a%20woman%20who%20is%20knowledgeable%20enough%20to%20determine%20if%20she%20is%20chaste,%20or%20married.) [Here is my translation of the entire passage:
The third point is that you should not operate on a woman who is skilled in this art, especially with your hand.
The fourth point is that the location for the incision on the stone (kidney or gallbladder) in women is closer to the bone, requiring a deeper incision, and it carries more risk there.
But if necessity demands it of you, then it is appropriate to take on a skilled female physician, although they are rare.
But if you are deprived of that, then look for a clever and subtle man, or present a mature woman who is knowledgeable in the affairs of women, or a woman who has some experience in this art.[1](footnote)
Therefore, present that person (i.e. the female midwife or healer) and order her to do everything you command, starting with examining the stone at the beginning; this is important because she should examine whether the woman is a virgin, in which case she should insert her finger into the anus of the woman and feel for the stone.
Therefore, if she finds it (i.e. the stone), then press down on it with her finger and then order her to make an incision over it.
But if she is not a virgin, then order the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina of the patient and feel for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder and carefully examining it.[1](footnote)
Therefore, if she finds it (i.e. the stone), then order her to gradually push the stone from the opening of the bladder down towards the perineum with the help of her skill and experience until it reaches the level of the thigh.[1](footnote)
Then order her to make an incision over the prominence of the pubis at the level of the thigh where the stone is located, and ensure that the tip of the knife does not touch the stone, but instead carefully dissect around it.[1](footnote)
And the incision should be small at first; then insert the rod into that incision and if you feel the stone, then adjust the depth of the incision based on the size of the stone that you know can be removed through it.[1](footnote)
And you should know that the types of stones are numerous: some are small and large, hard and rough, long and round, with jagged edges or smooth surfaces.
Therefore, you should be aware of the different types of stones and their characteristics so that you can make informed decisions about how to proceed with surgery or treatment.
And if you want to stop bleeding, apply a mixture of vitriol trissat (probably a form of copper sulfate) to the area for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation until the stone has been removed.
And make sure that you have all the necessary instruments for removing a stone from the male bladder prepared and ready to use, in case they are needed during the operation. [*](footnote)
And if you notice bleeding during the operation and you know that it is coming from an artery that has been cut, then apply a powder (such as styptic powder) to the area and tighten the wound with forceps or a clamp to stop the bleeding. Do not try to remove the stone at this point, as doing so could cause the patient to lose too much blood and potentially die. And then treat the wound (i.e. close it up with stitches or other means of wound closure).[1](footnote)
And once the bleeding has stopped and the wound has begun to heal (i.e. after a few days), then you can return to your operation and continue removing the stone.
Chapter LXII.
On incision for hernia treatment.
An inguinal hernia is not simply a collection of fluid in the white membrane located below the groin and containing the testicles, which is known as the scrotum. Rather, it is an abnormal protrusion or bulge that occurs when part of the intestine or fatty tissue pushes through a weakened area in this membrane.
Sometimes, however, the hernia occurs in the natural folds of skin and fat that surround the testicle (i.e. the scrotum), before it has fully descended into its proper position. This is known as a congenital or developmental hernia, and is caused by a weakness or defect in the abdominal wall that allows part of the intestine or fatty tissue to protrude through.
The cause of this type of hernia is often due to a weakness or debility in the abdominal muscles that make up the groin region (i.e. the inguinal canal), which allows the intestine or fatty tissue to push through and form a bulge.
The fluid or discharge that is present in the inguinal hernia can vary in color and consistency, depending on the underlying cause of the condition. Some possible colors and consistencies include:
The text goes on to describe how to identify the location of the fluid accumulation in an inguinal hernia. Specifically, it notes that if the swelling is located in the scrotum (i.e. the white membrane below the groin that contains the testicles), then it will appear as a round or oval-shaped lump that is slightly elongated in shape, similar to an egg. The text also advises looking for signs of swelling or bulging in the groin area, as this can indicate the presence of a hernia sac containing fluid.
And if the moisture is in the proper fatty tissue, then the abscess is rounded with division of the fluid, and for this reason, it is considered to be another fluid.
And if the moisture is between the scrotum of the genitals and the white hip bone, then make an incision there.
And if you want to know the color of the humor, then probe the color of the humor in the abscess with a small curved instrument, whose shape is known beforehand; and based on what comes out on the tip of the instrument, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment with iron, it is appropriate to order the patient to be bled if that is possible for you, and open a vein in him.
Then let him be rolled onto his side for some reason, and place soft cloths beneath him.
Then place yourself on the left side of the patient and order the minister to follow on his right side, who should extend the patient's penis to one of two sides, either towards the scrotum of the genitals or towards the navel of the belly.
Then take a broad-bladed spatula and split the scrotum of the genitals in the middle so that it is cut along its length towards the penis.
And make the incision according to the proper rule, at an equal distance from the line that should be drawn along the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white hip bone, including it.
And dissect that, and observe carefully, and take care not to cut too deeply into it; and your dissection should be such that you separate the parts gently, with the thickest and finest humors suspended and carefully examined according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Then pierce the hip bone filled with water using a wide perforation, and extract all of the water.
Then separate between the two lips of the incision with hooks and pull the hip bone apart in those places above; and do not touch the scrotum or the genitals that are included, but rather make an incision in the hip bone in such a way as is possible for you. And make an incision in it with its entirety or in pieces, and especially its subtle side, because if you do not examine the incision carefully, there is no certainty that the water will not return.
But if the humor protrudes from that side of the scrotum during your operation, then after you have completed the incision in the hip bone, return it inside and adjust the two lips of the scrotum with sutures; and take care of it in this way as with other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the humor corrupted by some other illness, then it is necessary to tie off the veins that are below the suspensory ligament and extract the humor and take care of it in the manner that has been said.
But if the water is gathered in two parts separately, then know that there are two hernias; therefore incise that part in the same way as you have done with the other one; and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then do it.
Then clean away the blood and insert wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions; and place outside other wool that you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two genitals and the navel of the belly; and place folded cloths and padding over it, and bind those with a linen ligature that is made according to this form:
And let two cloths be prepared and filled with red wool in this manner; and let the extremities that are pressed with tight or wet wool be made in this way; and let them be attached with a framework in the front of the pants, and one of the extremities should take hold of the buttocks from inside to outside, and the second should take hold at the place of the penis, and two ends on each side below the hips, and all of the structure should be adjusted in the front of the pants.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with a cautery instead of an incision with iron; and it is done by taking a small knife-like cautery and making an incision with it in the scrotum, and igniting it as we have recommended until the white hip bone containing the water is revealed, and then you take a cautery in this form: And it is shaped like the Greek letter gamma (Γ).
Then pierce the hip bone with that cautery and ignite it until all of the moisture has been expelled.
Then pull the hip bone apart with hooks, and dissect it with hooks, and dissect with a fine cautery that is ignited; and make an incision in it as far as is possible for you until you eradicate all of it; and take care not to let the fire touch the humor.
And know that this operation is more safe and longer-lasting in preventing blood flow, and better than an operation with incisions.
But if you encounter an abscess in the hour of incision or in the hour of cauterization, or blood flow, then you must cure that which opposes you for this reason, with a treatment that is appropriate according to what has been said.
But if the patient is fearful and does not hope for a second operation because of its horror, then administer a perforation as we have recommended; and this should be done when you are certain, based on what has been said about signs, that the hernia contains water.
Then it is necessary that you place the patient on some kind of cushioned support, and then pierce the abscess in its lowest part with a broad-bladed spatula, and make the perforation according to the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide so that all of the water is drained out.
Then place soft cloths on top of it and bind it, allowing the remaining water to drain out. Then take care of it until the wound is healed.
But if there is an obstacle to the outflow of water at that time when you perforate it, this should not be done unless the white fat in the orifice of the wound opposes it and prevents the flow of water. In this case, it is necessary to insert into the wound a probe or instrument with which water was extracted from patients with dropsy, the shape of which is known beforehand; or attach a small piece of wood in the pressure point of the wound.
And know that the water returns and increases again after several months or even a year; and when it has increased, then let it be perforated in this manner as before, because the patient will thus pass his days in this way.
Chapter 63.
Of incision in a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the operation for this hernia, there is fear of danger to life in many cases; therefore, I recommend avoiding surgery and choosing the safer option.
And I remember the operation for that type of hernia and the species of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses are born in the bodies of those whose genitals are conjoined for many reasons: either due to acute sharp superfluity, which is infused into the genitals, or due to injury.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and pain is not found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And a light-colored abscess is called "lapificated," whose color is dark, and there is no pain in it.
And sometimes it is caused by knots in the arteries and by infusion of those as well, which are already noticeable, or by infusion of veins.
But that which is caused by infusion of arteries is recognized by the dispersion of the abscess when you press it with your fingers; and it is not necessary to touch it.
But that which is caused by infusion of veins is not dispersed by any means due to compression with the fingers.
And it is possible to make an incision in this type and on other fleshy parts; and this should be done by making an incision in the scrotum, extending the humors upward, extracting it from the white hip bone, releasing the suspensory ligament of the veins, tying them off, and cutting the suspensory ligament more than you release it from all parts of the humors.
Therefore, if the humor has already solidified with those fleshy parts, then it is necessary to extract the humor and make an incision in it.
And if there is an adhesion between some cause of the abscess, or between what is between the belly surfaces, then you must release all of that adhesion and make an incision around it with a rounded instrument.
But if there is fleshy growth in the place of the adhesion which is behind it, then you must incise all that which belongs to it and extract the tumor as we have said.
When your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then heal it with the other healing method until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
Of the healing of a hernia that is in the belly.
The term "vitz" refers to an abscess enclosed by some kind of covering similar to a hernia with softening of the testicles, and it makes movement and exercise difficult for the patient.
And in the healing of this illness, it is done out of fear of what precedes it, which is reminiscence (or recollection).
However, we must also speak of the operation in the second case after the first one has been performed.
And I say that it is necessary to lay the patient on an elevated cushion; and then pull up the scrotum's suspensory ligament to the lower parts; and then tie the genital cord with the sinew or bands that are proven to be attached to the rod (or stick); and have other assistants stretch those parts with strong extension.
And then make an incision with a broad, thin-bladed spatula in a transverse section where the vessels are located so that the vessels are exposed.
And then remove all of the tissue as we have said in the extraction of hernias which are located in the temples.
And then place a needle with double filament in it and tie the first knot at the beginning of the location where the hernia occurs, and tie another knot at the end of it. And then make an incision in the middle of the location with a straight section according to the length of the body and remove what has accumulated from the foul and corrupted humors.
And then heal the wound with a treatment for other wounds where you want health to be generated so that the vessels fall which nourish one of the two genitals, because it is not harmful for that reason.
But if all of the vessels are affected, then the testicles must be removed or allowed to atrophy with the vessels so that they are deprived of all nourishment from the incision of the vessels and become useless, or allowed to become useless for no benefit from them.
Chapter 65.
Of the healing of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a section that forms in the abdomen, extending over the belly from some of the angles of the intestines, causing part of the intestines to protrude through the opening made by the rupture.
And this rupture is either of the abdomen or due to a weakness in it, and both types can occur for various reasons: a blow, a sudden movement, loud noise, lifting a heavy object, or similar causes.
And the sign of this, when it is due to extension of the abdomen, is that it occurs gradually over a long period of time and not suddenly, and there is swelling (or an abscess) near the navel because the abdomen compresses the intestines.
And the sign of this, when it is due to a section in the abdomen, is that at the beginning there is sudden and intense pain; and there is a different type of swelling lower down near the groin area, which is due to protrusion of the intestine, and the body of the hernia is located outside the abdomen.
And sometimes part of the intestine protrudes through the tissue and this type of hernia is called an intestinal hernia or "zirbal".
And sometimes hernias are caused by gas, and sometimes they occur in a split in the intestine and become trapped there, causing great suffering for the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain that is worse when pressed.
And in the healing of the types of this illness with iron (or surgery), there is fear because it is necessary to avoid incision in that area.
And the method of operation for this is to instruct the patient to push the intestine back into its cavity using their own hand and obeying their natural urge to defecate, and then have them lie on their side between your hands while you lift their legs.
And then tie the cord that connects the testicles to the abdomen, and make an incision along the entire length of the cord connecting the testicles; and then insert two hooks into the edges of the incision as needed to separate the edges.
And if the incision is as large as possible so that part of the hernia protrudes through it.
And then remove the membrane that covers the abdomen below the cord connecting the testicles to it, so that the white, hard lining of the abdominal cavity is exposed on all sides.
Then you insert your finger into the opening where the testicle is located, between the white abdominal lining and the cord connecting it to the body, and separate any adhesions present in the area behind the testicle.
And then use your hand to pull the cord connecting the testicles forward, and with this motion extend the white abdominal lining upward with your left hand, while lifting the testicle and abdomen to the site of the incision with your right hand. Instruct your assistant to stretch the testicle outward and you can then dissolve any adhesions present in the area behind it using a complete solution (or treatment).
And use your fingers to ensure that there is no intestine trapped within the white, hard abdominal lining. If you find some cause in him, then you cover it with your belly.
Then incise the area below the sinew of the testicles, along a section where blood and pus can flow out as we have described in what has been said before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound and bind it; then administer the ligament we have described (and sometimes the white hip is cauterized, which we have said should be done before the incision to prevent bleeding, as this often happens). Leave the ligament until it falls off on its own.
But if the healing process is delayed, then use hot water and soak a cloth in it, and place it on top of the wound as we have described before.
Then care for the wound with other wound treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of ventral (or inguinal) hernia.
In this type of hernia, we have not seen any who dared to treat it with iron (or metal).
And the first (doctors) said that it should be done as we have described in the hernia with pus; which is to tie off the vessels near the incision site with ease and then dry up the surrounding area around the abscess using whatever means necessary, until the vessels fall away.
And care for the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the disruption (or injury) that occurs in the tendons.
Sometimes, a complete break in the tendons occurs as we have described, and this protrusion is visible.
And let there be no pressure on the intestines from the hernia; and if there is any, it should be minimal; and it should always return to its original position.
But if this condition persists over time, then a fissure (or split) may develop in the abdominal wall, causing the intestines to protrude into the abdomen; this happens due to the extension of the abdominal muscles as we have described earlier. The cause is that the abdominal muscles become stretched out and weakened, leading to infection and inflammation in the affected area.
And the treatment of it is with cautery, as I have described before.
And sometimes it is treated with metal devices in the following way: the patient lies on their back between your hands, and then the affected area of the protruding abscess is dried up using incisions made horizontally in three-finger widths.
And then strengthen the white hip that is below the sinew so that it is exposed.
And then take the rod and place it over the protruding part of the abdomen, and press it against the pressure point of the stomach.
And then bind the two protruding areas on either side of the rod with sutures.
And then carefully remove the rod without cutting into the abdomen or extracting too much of it, and do not stretch or pull on the intestines or cause any other damage as you know in the treatment of internal hernias.
And then treat that with the treatment of wounds and clean it as you cut into the abscess, and restore the wound until it is consolidated because the abdominal muscles are contracted and the protrusion is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this case because it is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
Of weakening (or relaxing) the sinew of the testicles.
Often the sinew of the testicles in some men becomes weakened because the surrounding flesh is weakened, and this condition requires careful observation and treatment.
Then it is necessary for the one treating him in cure to make the patient lie down according to their size, and straighten out all the skin that is relaxed over the natural spine; and then adjust the two lips with stitches.
And if you wish, first remove the excess relaxed skin with three or four sutures and firm stitches.
Then insert between the sutures, and then heal any other wounds through cure until it is healed and pus comes out.
Chapter 69.
On castration.
Know that castration is excommunicated in our law, but it is permitted for me to remember it in this book; and the remembrance of it is not necessary except in two ways, one of which is so that it may be in the knowledge of the doctor when he is questioned about it, so that he knows how to cure the one to whom it happens; and the other way is that we often have a need for castration of other animals for our livestock, such as mules, and oxen, and pigs, and similar animals.
And so I say that castration is done in two ways: either by crushing or by cutting in half.
But in the one that is done by crushing, the method of the operation is that we submerge the animal in hot water until its genitals become relaxed and limp and hang down. Then take them with your hand while they are relaxed and do not show underneath the covering.
But in castration done by cutting and dividing, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the spine of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the spermatic cord and cut into each one with an incision up to two processes.
Then cut out any remaining tissue that you have dissected. And do not leave any cause on the kidney area, but make a fine incision that is above the veins.
And this method of castration done by crushing is better because crushing leaves very little cause (bruising or swelling) on the testicles, so that the animal desires to mate less.
Then heal the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
On the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: the first is when there is a space between the scrotum and the testicles, where there appears to be a woman's vulva between two testicles.
And sometimes urine comes out of this space in the scrotum.
But in women, it occurs in one way: and that is when the labia of the woman on the pubic mound resembles two testicles of a man slightly separated at the front, like the male scrotum and two testicles.
And the treatment is of three types: two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you cut and adjust the swollen flesh to relieve its pressure, and then heal those areas with treatment for other wounds.
And in the second type of men, where there is urine in the scrotum, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
On leprosy and excessive flesh caused by female influences.
Leprosy is easily recognized by its natural characteristics when it becomes prominent, and sometimes it becomes so pronounced in some women that it spreads as much as in men, even to the point of affecting their ability to have sexual intercourse.
Therefore, it is necessary to remove the excess leprosy with your hand or forceps and cut into it.
And do not cut too deeply, especially near the root, to avoid causing bleeding.
And then heal the wound with treatment for other wounds until it is healed.
Meat born is flesh that is in the womb of the mother and fills it up, and it easily comes out in pieces similar to it (and because of this some call it "tailed disease"); therefore, it is necessary for us to proceed as when we operate on a tumor, and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of jaundice.
Jaundice is when the woman's womb is not perforated or has a small hole. And it can be natural or accidental.
Accidental jaundice is caused by an illness that has occurred beforehand, and this type of jaundice can be caused by meat that was not properly cooked or by a thin or thick bile.
And jaundice can develop in the prenatal stage of the mother or in her ribs, upper or lower belly, and it prevents sleeping, sweating, and breastfeeding, and often leads to an interruption in menstruation.
The detection of jaundice is done by observing the mother's navel if it appears sunken or swollen, but if it's not visible, then examine her with your hands or a rod.
But if the sunken appearance is due to thin bile and it's located near the two lips (labia), then you should apply warmth and break open the blockage.
And place your fingers on both labia, then gently apply pressure with your thumb on each side of the area.
And have the woman lie on her back with her hips extended and gently separate both labia with force until the thin bile is released and the obstruction is cleared.
Then take wool and soak it in oil, place it on the area, and have a man change it daily to ensure that the incision does not become solidified.
But if the bile is thick and viscous, then it is necessary to perform an incision using a broad-bladed knife or myrtle leaves.
But if the obstruction is caused by food, then suspend it with a hook and make an incision into it.
And use medicines that stop bleeding without causing pain, such as hemlock, dragon's blood, and alum mixed with egg white.
And administer a wide lead cannula to prevent the wound from becoming solidified too quickly.
And keep it in place for several days and administer warm water to help with the healing process.
And cure it with other solidification treatments until healed.
And sometimes during childbirth other flesh is born, and it's necessary to incise according to this method. But if this is due to cancerous abscesses in the uterus, then it is not appropriate to use any form of iron treatment.
Chapter 73.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, tailbone pain, and red bumps that occur in the female's womb.
Hemorrhoids are recognized by the presence of dilated veins that bleed continuously, and chronic hemorrhoids are formed when these veins become engorged.
I have already discussed in the previous sections the various types of hemorrhoids and their symptoms, as well as which ones can be treated and which cannot.
I say that hemorrhoids and tumors located in the uterus that cannot be felt with touch should not be treated using iron instruments.
However, those located in the opening of the womb that can be felt by touch, these are the ones that can be cured.
It is necessary to place the woman in a warm bath and then use a rough cloth or an abrasive material with forceps to incise those that can be reached with scissors.
And use finely ground powders from one of the incisive herbs without pain, such as acacia and similar substances.
And have her soak her feet in hot water for an hour and then place it in cold water.
And if bleeding persists, then use a sitz bath of chamomile and corn silk as well as walnut shells and similar substances.
And make a poultice from barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and apply it on the back of the patient.
And if the blood is let, it is good; otherwise, apply two leeches and make incisions on the nipples.
Then take wool and soak it in the sap of holly or the sap of agarwood or the sap of mistletoe with wine and attach it to the area; and then heal the area with ointment until it is healed.
And heal that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of perforation, an accident occurring in the womb.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cranium (a hard abscess), lapidary abscess, ulcers, hernias, erpetromens, hemorrhoids, fistulas, ruptures, tumors, and other abscesses. I have already mentioned these illnesses and their types and symptoms in the previous sections.
And it is necessary for me to discuss in this treatise a boil that appears in the womb when an abscess matures and heals, and if you wish to know how the operation of it with iron is carried out.
Therefore, you must consider if the pain of the boil at its onset is sharp with percussion and flexion and fever, and sometimes reddening occurs, and if it catches feeling over it, then do not attempt to perforate it. Instead, treat it with what aids in the maturation process until the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
And then you must have the woman lie down on a cushion with two cushions; recline her on her back and position her legs below her navel, spread her thighs apart, place her arms away from her belly button, and secure each one appropriately.
Then the midwife should follow the straight line and administer the instrument used to open the orifice of the womb, the shape of which will be described in those cases that are addressed later.
And it is necessary when you administer this instrument that you insert with care the probe of the woman's womb, and what enters the womb from the instrument should not be larger than the probe of the womb and cause discomfort to the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the probe of the womb, then it is necessary to place cotton on the surface of the probe of the womb so that it prevents the entry of the entire instrument into the probe of the womb.
And it is necessary to place the vertex that runs along the instrument on top and have the minister hold the instrument and rotate the vertex until the orifice of the womb is open.
And when the growth appears and is touched by hand and becomes soft and moist, then it is necessary to cut that off with a flat spatula.
And when the pus has been evacuated, then it is necessary to place a wick soaked in rose oil or green oil with some stypticity in the wound; and place the seal on the incision at the probe of the womb.
And place outside the womb and on the penetrating wool that has been soaked in water with crushed marshmallows.
And then it should be healed after two days with ointment which is suitable for until it has healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed with a mixture of water and honey, and then with water in which rosemary or long arista has been boiled, and then return to the ointment.
And if the wound extends deep into the womb, then it is necessary to avoid treating it with iron and instead use what has been mentioned in the previous sections.
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives how unborn infants are treated when there is an abnormality in their shape or form.
It is necessary for the midwife to know in the beginning the figure of a natural childbirth by its signs, and that when you see a woman pushing at her lower parts and wanting to breathe fresh air, and she feels relieved when something from the womb passes, and she rushes into the delivery of the infant, then you will know that this birth is in accordance with a natural shape, and it occurs above the head of the infant and the afterbirth attached or hanging by the umbilical cord.
Therefore, when you see those signs, then it is necessary to press the woman's belly so that the infant descends gently because when it comes above its head, give her the afterbirth which should be cleaned of excess matter with good cleansing.
But if this birth is unnatural and not commendable because when the infant comes out, its body is above its head and its feet are in front of its face or one hand or arm is at its side or foot. Or the infant comes out with its head and arm first or its belly, and it quickly turns over onto its neck, resembling the shapes of unnatural positions.
Therefore, it is essential for the midwife to be knowledgeable and skillful in all such cases and that she avoid errors and disappointment.
And I will show all figures of these, and what sign is in each one so that it can be understood by this and become clear on the matter.
When the infant comes out above its head due to natural force and it is heavy on the woman, making her delivery difficult, and sometimes its strength has already been weakened, then perform this gentle cut or have women hold it, and evaporate its conjunctiva with fenugreek cooked in warm oil.
And then the midwife should insert her small spatula between the woman's thighs and cut the afterbirth or separate it with her nail until it releases the fluid inside it. And press on the woman's belly until she delivers the infant.
But if it doesn't come out, then the woman should be massaged with powdered licorice root and fenugreek mixed with crushed chickpeas.
And then command the woman to cough and clear her throat with the help of a condiment; cover her mouth and nose for an hour because the infant will be expelled quickly.
And if both of the infant's hands are already out at the beginning, then you must carefully and gradually return those hands to their proper position. But if it doesn't obey the intervention, then place the woman on a cushion, raise her legs, and tilt the cushion towards the ground; have her held securely so that she does not fall during the movement.
But if the limbs are not returned inside and the infant dies, then cut those parts and extract its bones or tie its body to your hand with a cloth and pull it out gently, because it will be expelled.
When the infant is on its feet, then you must push those legs upwards and gradually turn it over, and then take hold of it, and then take one of its feet and slowly stretch out its limbs.
Once he has entered between the thighs, you then command him to expel air, and make him sneeze with precaution, for it will force out the blockage if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled with what we have recommended, then you gradually return it until the second natural function resumes, for it will be expelled lightly with a sneeze at that point.
And if it is forbidden with all that we have recommended, then take marshmallow and slippery elm bark, grind them thoroughly in the mortar for good percussion, and apply liniments to the woman's pubic bone and the lower abdomen of the patient. And then perform that massage in warm water until it reaches the hypochondrias.
And when you see that the sides of the patient are relaxed, then do a steam inhalation with myrtle and place it under his nose. And when you do the steam inhalation for an hour, then you perform that massage on a cushion and make him sneeze and clear his mouth, and remove it from there, and gently press the lower abdomen with light compression, for the blockage will be expelled immediately.
The expulsion of the blockage laterally while one of his hands hangs down. Let his hand be reduced in size, but if you cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then let her lie on her side and strike his hips with forceful vibrations, and administer generously the juices and remedies that you have recommended, such as mucilages.
And if childbirth has come, then perform that massage on a cushion and focus on reducing the swelling of the hand, knead the blockage according to natural function, make the woman sneeze and command him to compress himself until it is expelled.
The expulsion of the blockage on her back with his hands spread out and his body next to his mother's. It is necessary for the midwife to hold the baby and gently rotate it little by little until it becomes easier.
And when it is expelled and how much of it is expelled, then place on the pubic bone what we have recommended of oil and mucilages.
And then you command him to move gently little by little, and when you have done that, then perform that massage on a cushion and command her to be inclined on the right side, and then command her to compress herself, and make her sneeze with caution. The exit of the prepared fetus on its side.
When the afterbirth separates from the mother in this manner, then consider and then insert your fingernail into the cervix until it is emptied of moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended on its face and neck, then insert your finger into the umbilical cord to prevent it from being retained and dying.
And then push the fetus into the internal parts until you reach the second position that is necessary, and command the woman to compress herself several times, and it will be expelled with a light expulsion if God wills it.
The exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born, but this is rare and happens late; but there are natural causes for it, and they are not alive.
And count the number of twins, whether they are multiples, and they are separated by the navel, distinguishing between the ligament in the umbilical cord of each one. Sometimes they are expelled with a light natural expulsion, like a single fetus with a mild expulsion, and sometimes they are expelled with an unnatural expulsion as we have recommended.
And if the afterbirth is difficult to deliver and reaches what we have said about unnatural positions, then cure it as we have described.
And if the midwife is skillful and does what brings ease and subtlety, with patience, and uses all methods that are prepared for her in order to bring about safety.
Remembering what is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Some women have multiple pregnancies, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even ten fetuses, which I can confirm has occurred - where one woman aborts or gives birth to six, while another delivers all ten, a phenomenon caused by measurement of the wise.
And all of this must be in the knowledge of the midwife because it is a very simple matter for her to recognize and deal with accordingly.
Chapter 76
On the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat the dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medicine and it is not expelled, then you must use manual operation if necessary. However, you should consider whether the woman is of strong health and not afflicted by any of the conditions that make her vulnerable to danger.
Then the woman should be lying on her side with her hip inclined downward and her knees raised.
And the assistant should hold the woman's legs apart or straddle her to prevent her body from moving during the extraction of the fetus.
And then you should moisten the woman's mouth with warm oil and mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
And then the midwife should apply those oils and mucilages to her hands and gently insert her hand into the woman's body with ease, and then carefully feel for the location where she can insert her fingers and grasp the fetus.
And then you should consider the following: if the fetus is positioned with its head downward, then you should insert your fingers into its heels or neck or mouth or palate or under its chin or in its armpits or just below its ribs or under its hips.
But if the discomfort is on his feet, either in the tendon or in the middle of the ribs.
It is necessary to hold the nails with the right hand, and place the curve of it in the location that is between the said fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the nails into one of those locations that I mentioned, until reaching the swollen cause.
Then place and fix another nail or the third one if necessary, in order to create a counter-pressure, and prevent excessive extension along its length.
And it is beneficial in all aspects, for the swelling to be relieved as it happens with tooth extraction.
And it is necessary in that case for the extension to be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then the midwife must anoint her fingers with oil and insert them, introducing movement and manipulating what is retained.
Therefore, if the fetal part is expelled, then the nails must be inserted into the location that is more open; and do so until the entire fetus is expelled.
But if the hand is swollen in front of the other and cannot be reduced due to its constriction, then a cloth must be wrapped around it; and extract it until it is completely expelled, inserting it either into the wrist joint or the armpit.
And do the same with the other hand and both feet.
But if the fetus's head is large or it encounters constriction during delivery, or there is water trapped in its head, then it is necessary to insert between the said vertebrae and split open the head, extracting the water or dissecting it with an instrument called "alundat", whose shape will be described in the following chapter.
And similarly, do the same if the fetus has a large head by nature: and then insert it with force or take it out with a "alundat" as I have mentioned before, and extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is expelled but becomes trapped at the fork, then it must be split open in order to release the moisture that has accumulated in the chest.
But if it is not complicated or does not present with delivery difficulties, then you should insert the head as soon as possible according to your abilities.
And if the lower abdomen is affected by an abscess or has fluid accumulation, then it is necessary to make a puncture in order to drain the moisture that is inside.
But if the fetus is on its feet, then the delivery will be easy and the direction of the fetus to the mother's birth canal will also be straightforward.
But if it is trapped near the stomach and chest, then you must extract it using a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand, and make an incision in the stomach and chest until the fluid inside has been drained.
But if the other limbs are obstructed and the head turns inward, then the midwife must insert her left hand, but if the birth canal is narrow, she must insert it into the layer of fat and search for the head with it, pulling it out through the birth canal using one or two nails to grip it.
But if the birth canal is constricted by an abscess or tumor caused by inflammation, then it must not be aggravated; in this case, it is necessary to administer a warm poultice of moist and greasy substances. And apply poultices, and care for the patient with warm and moist baths that soften and hydrate the body.
And if the fetus is lying on its side, then it is preferable to perform a Caesarean section; and administer what we have mentioned for a living fetus.
And if that is not possible, then make an incision through the abdomen and extract it.
It is important to ensure that no foreign matter remains inside the womb.
And once you have completed your procedure, then administer the treatment that we have mentioned for abscesses and tumors that may arise in the mother's body.
And if there is a flow of blood, then place her in warm and antiseptic waters, and administer the other treatment that we have mentioned.
And I have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus, and another time, after applying heat to the abdomen, the fetus was expelled and it was already dead. It once happened to a woman who had an abscess in her navel for a long time, and it became so inflamed that she began to experience pain and swelling in her arms.
And I was called upon to treat her for an extended period of time, but the condition did not improve despite my medical treatment.
Then I applied strong adhesive poultices to her abdomen, and eventually an object resembling a bone was expelled from her body. After several days, another bone-like object was expelled. I was amazed that there could be bones in her womb.
And then I considered the possibility that these were the bones of the dead fetus.
Therefore I continued to treat her, and was able to extract many bones from her body. The woman was in good spirits and was eventually cured, with only a minor swelling remaining in one arm.
I did not find it strange, for in such cases medical knowledge and the skilled hands of a surgeon can provide valuable assistance in administering treatment.
Here are the shapes of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus:
Here is the shape of the forceps with which to open the birth canal:
Here is the shape of the speculum, which is used to open the birth canal: However, it is important that this instrument (the speculum) has the quality of being more slender than the dilator and should be made either of ivory or a light wood such as boxwood.
The width of each blade should be about two fingers wide and the edges should be about one finger thick. The length of each blade should be one palm and a half in length. In the middle where the two blades meet, there should be two hinges made of the same material as the blades, which are already connected and fixed. The width of each hinge should be about two fingers wide or slightly more, and the length should be the same as one palm plus a little more than half.[1](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/a6/Use-a-Speculum-Step-18.jpg/aid4037952-v4-728px-Use-a-Speculum-Step-18.jpg)
And these two attachments should be inserted into the birth canal so that they open it when you rotate the two prescribed blades.
Here is another shape similar to the first one, but more slender and lightweight:
The shape of this instrument should be made from a piece of ivory or light wood, similar to the shape of forceps. It has two branches that come together at the tip and are hinged in the middle, allowing them to open and close. This instrument is used to dilate the cervix during childbirth, making it easier for the fetus to pass through the birth canal. The branches of this instrument should be slender and lightweight, similar to the second speculum described earlier.[1](https://www.medicalexpo.com/prod/gynecare-france-sas/product-CSP-25879-462302-GYNECARE-Speculum-Hegar-Plastic.html) However, at the end of this instrument there are two extensions similar to those described earlier, and the length of these extensions is about one palm, while the width of each extension is two fingers. This allows for a more precise and controlled dilation of the cervix during childbirth, making it easier for the fetus to pass through the birth canal. The hinged branches should be slender and lightweight, similar to the second speculum described earlier.[1](https://www.medicalexpo.com/prod/gynecare-france-sas/product-CSP-25879-462302-GYNECARE-Speculum-Hegar-Plastic.html)
When you wish to open the birth canal with these instruments, have the woman lie on her back with her legs spread apart and elevated, exposing the area between her thighs. This will provide easy access for the medical practitioner to insert the speculum or dilator into the vagina and widen the birth canal as needed.[1](https://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Speculum) And then open your hand with the instrument, just as you would with forceps, according to the size of the opening that you desire for the birth canal. The midwife can then manipulate the instrument to achieve the desired effect.[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/249068)
Here is the shape of the forceps that the ancients called "vertitge":
Here is the shape of the instrument called an "impellent," which is used to push or guide the fetus during childbirth:
A way to reduce a swelling, which is to restrict the large head
And it is assembled like forceps with teeth at the end, just as you sometimes see, and occasionally it is made long like forceps of this shape, with teeth similar to serrated teeth that are inserted and constricted. A way to reduce swelling slightly:
A way to use a hook with a spine:
A way to use a hook with two spines:
A way to use a spatula having two ends, with which the head is cut off:
A way to use two broad spatulas:
All these instruments are exercised, and the more the types of them are multiplied and prepared by the craftsmen, the easier they are to use in their operations and the better they are for people due to their quantity.
And you should not be without any of these instruments, whatever they may be, because their necessity is not avoidable.
On the extraction of a splinter.
When the splinter is stuck, you must use suction, which means that you should tell the patient to hold their breath, and then you should make them sneeze with conditions (such as tickling their nose), and place your hand strongly over their mouth and nostrils, and if it comes out because of this, it's good.
And if not, then you take a piece of cloth and make a hole in it, placing wet herbs on the mouth of the instrument, such as chamomile, rue, anise, camomile, Arabic gum, cinnamon wood, and Santolina. All of these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water on the cloth, and then place it over heat (such as a fire).
Then place a reed cannula in the mouth of the instrument, and hold it inside so that the vapor comes into the cavity of the instrument.
And then make them sneeze as we said before, and the splinter will come out quickly.
But if this treatment does not work and the splinter remains, then you should tell the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage, and then insert it into the wound with care until she finds the splinter, and once she has found it, she should take hold of it and slowly pull it out little by little. But if it is stuck in the flesh, then she should insert her hand again as we have recommended, and when she finds the splinter, she should remove it gently, bit by bit, according to proper procedure so that the patient does not feel pain because of the violent pulling. Beforehand, it is necessary that the wound be easily accessible from both the right and left sides.
And if the mouth of the wound is narrow, we have already recommended treatment with suction and medication on a cloth with herbs.
But if the splinter is not removed by all of the causes we have recommended, then make sure that you do not continue pulling on it, but rather let what comes out of the wound go onto the woman's thigh, and then cover it with honey and tetrafarmacon; because this will cause it to rot over several days and be dissolved and removed.
But when it begins to rot, it causes great harm to the head and stomach of the patient, so it is necessary to administer appropriate fumigations at that time.
But ancient remedies for this include fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
A way to use an instrument for fumigation of a woman in the case of menstrual retention and splinters:
It is made from glass or lead.
And the thin end should be placed in the wound and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation should be applied to the embers of the fire.
And hold it inside so that the fumigation is consumed and repeat as necessary.
On the treatment of an infant's non-perforated buttocks (or "the buttocks of a child who has not been circumcised").
When a child is born and their buttocks are not perforated, which appear thin and swollen. Then the midwife should pierce that swelling with her finger; and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp spatula, and make sure that it does not touch the artery.
And then place wool soaked in wine and oil over it, and treat it with honey until it is healed.
But if you fear that it will become swollen again, then place a cannula in the wound for several days and remove it when the child wants to urinate.
And it has happened that the buttocks have become swollen due to inflammation or abscess; in this case, the swelling should be incised and treated with the same methods as described for treating an abscess and using lead.
On the treatment of fistulas that develop afterwards.
Fistulas that develop in the lower part of the buttocks are often large and knotted, and they form either directly next to the anus or in the space between the two cheeks.
And it is a single fistula or multiple fistulas (or "many fistulas").
And when the knotted mass is old and filled with wet, watery white pus or thin putrefaction, and occasionally some of these fistulas penetrate deeper.
And these deeper branches are known by what comes out of them through the exit and gas (or "flatulence"); and sometimes the patient experiences discomfort from the exit, and it is easy for worms to come out of them.
And some of these fistulas occasionally extend into the bladder and into the flesh of the penis, and others may penetrate into the joint of the hip and into the bone marrow of the thigh.
And the way to determine whether a fistula penetrates into the anus or not is to insert your finger gently into the anus and carefully probe the fistula with a thin piece of glass or metal (such as a needle) when there is no twisting in it.
But if in that crooked place, then insert into it a thin strip of lead or horsehair until you feel the strip or hair with your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all or notice any sign of discharge, such as pus, worms, or gas, as we have said, then you should know that it is non-penetrating, and so move on to the treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or into the flesh of the penis, then its meaning is that it causes emission of urine from that area and prevents it from being used for medicine until the affected area heals.
But if it is penetrating into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and causing pain in the surrounding area, then its sign is that it goes through the area if there is no curvature within the bone, and causes pain in the surrounding area of the affected part; and from it comes pus at all times; and that medicine does not work on it, nor is it healed with ointment.
And in all cases of penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the treatment for them is laborious and futile on the part of foolish doctors who insist on it.
But in those that are not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is hoped for, as I have advised you before, based on my experience.
And it is that the patient should lie between your hands on their back and raise their legs up towards you, with their thighs inclined toward their belly, and then carefully insert a thin strip of lead or iron if there is curvature in the fistula, until you know where it reaches.
And if you feel the patient around the anus, then you must insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel with your finger that the tract is already open and exposed, penetrating between your finger and the fistula or flesh, then you can be certain that it is penetrating; and in this case, do not work on it, as there is no healing possible, as we have said.
But some say that it heals in some men slowly.
And the treatment that is hoped to bring relief to it is that you ignite a fine cautery according to the size of the fistula, as was described earlier, and insert the heated tip into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; then repeat this two or three times until you know that all the affected tissues, which resemble the quills of a bird's feather, have been sealed.
And treat that with hot compresses wrapped in cloth until all the sealed tissues have been absorbed, and treat it with medicines that promote tissue growth and healing, and if it has healed, then it is good; but if not, then there is no cure for it at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters but does not penetrate your finger that is in the anus, and between it and the probe there is a thin layer of flesh or fat, and sometimes the fistula appears to dry out the surface of the rectum, then dry out the rectum from the beginning of the fistula, and you can see it drying with the probe, and leave it inside the fistula until the drying reaches the location where the end of the probe is, and through the probe it will be freed and released.
And clean those tissues affected by the fistula, which resemble a bird's feather quill, and ensure that there is no remaining debris or blockage in it.
But if bleeding sometimes occurs between your fingers and the operation when you insert those tissues, then let it flow and use a light instrument to cauterize it with heat or an acute medicine, because cautery with fire has two good effects: namely, sealing of the affected tissues and removal of excess blood through drying up the moisture.
And treat that with hot compresses wrapped in cloth or covered with three layers until the wound heals, and furthermore, you can also treat the ulcer by applying hardening and healing ointments to the affected tissues.
And use medicines that have astringent and drying properties, such as those made from styptic or drying herbs or substances. When this is done and the wound has healed completely, there is no need to worry about recurrence.
But if the fistula has penetrated into the rectum and is located deep beneath the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it carefully.
And so, if you feel that the probe is close to fat or flesh, and is near to penetrating, then do not operate on it but instead proceed with caution and hope for a positive outcome.
The treatment for this involves one of three methods: cauterization of the affected area as we have described; drying out the area until you can access its concavity and perform a suitable cure; do not cause excessive drying, as this may result in injury to the ligament that supports the anus and lead to involuntary bowel movements; instead, use methods that promote healing; or extend the thin layer of tissue and drain the pus from within it by using a probe or other sharp instrument, then clean the affected tissues in the area where you can perform percrustation; and finally, work towards fully restoring the damaged area through drying and sealing off the wound. If the opening is not yet closed and the fistula remains open near the anus, it will be easier for pus to leak out and cause discomfort for the patient. And sometimes the fistula can be treated in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, it reaches near the surface of the body around the anus and along the edge of the anus, then take a probe with a sharpened tip, similar to a needle used for preparing hearts, in the following shape:
And insert the probe wrapped in a piece of cloth or near the wound, and then insert the probe with fat into the fistula until you reach its concavity.
But if the fistula is deep inside the edge of the anus, then remove the fat from the probe and insert your finger into the anus. Remove the end of the fat and align both ends, tightening each one, leaving it in place for a day or two. When you reinsert the fat into the flesh between the two ends, make sure to tightly secure the area so that the flesh around the ends of the fat can heal properly.
And furthermore, treat the wound until it is healed and solidified.
But if the opening of the fistula is not deep enough, then make it deeper using any appropriate method as long as it does not penetrate too far into the rectum, so that you do not cause injury to the ligament. Then, treat the wound until it heals completely.
The shape of the spatula with a sharp curve that is used to open the fistula: it has a very sharp curvature on one side and a flat edge on the other, allowing for precise incisions and preventing unnecessary damage.
The method of stitching hemorrhoids that bleed during the incision:
Hemorrhoids can be classified into two types: those that are located inside the anus and resemble charcoal lumps, or those that appear as swollen, fatty deposits similar to grapes. Hemorrhoids can be small or large, and they may continuously bleed from them, or there may be multiple bleeding points on the surface of the hemorrhoid, both inside and outside the anus.
However, external hemorrhoids are classified into two types based on their level of moisture: those that have little moisture and leak a citrine-colored water or a small amount of blood with continuous movement and are the same color as the body.
The treatment for internal hemorrhoids involves instructing the patient to sit on the toilet and apply pressure until they defecate, causing the anus to expand and the hemorrhoids to become visible. Then you should position yourself and use forceps or your fingernail to make incisions along the veins of the hemorrhoids.
But if the forceps are not available due to moisture and softness of the hemorrhoids, then take a piece of rough cloth or gauze and use it with your fingers to extract the hemorrhoids. Then make incisions along the veins and apply some powdered cautery agents over the wounds, which will serve as an alternative to cauterization. Alternatively, you can perform cauterization according to the method described in the chapter on cauterization. And furthermore, treat the external hemorrhoids with other treatments until they are healed.
If the anus does not respond to defecation, then use a small-toothed enema on the patient with an enema that has a biting mechanism, and wash the area with water or other substances that are used in the anus, causing gentle defecation when the patient squeezes.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause is light, and it is necessary for you to take those with your nail, or to take those with forceps, and to insert those, and then cure those with what has been said earlier, so that they may be healed.
And the one who inserts (the hemorrhoids) should administer sutures in the following manner: take silk thread wrapped in a needle and insert it into the anus, pulling the hemorrhoids up to the incision site. Then, use the needle to penetrate the tissue on the other side of the incision, enveloping both ends of the silk thread in the tissue below the incision, laterally. Tightly bind the hemorrhoid with a strong knot and remove the needle.
And do the same to all (hemorrhoids), leaving one and not binding it, so that the excess blood may flow from it.
And place a cloth soaked in rose oil or wax on the anus, and put it on the patient's bottom while instructing them to rest. And leave one inside that has not come out, and when it comes out, cure those with ointment or other treatments until they are healed.
And if they are old and do not respond to medicine, then you should incise the fistula tract with a spatula probe or your nail until it becomes moist, and remove any pus on top of it, preventing it from solidifying; then cure them until they heal completely.
And now you should incise those with a very sharp scalpel until they bleed and are scraped clean, then cure them until they heal completely.
Know that to lance (an abscess) is key, and it should not be done unless you see a red swelling resembling the head of a nail in any part of the body, but especially in areas below the feet and ears, and always pay attention to where the pain occurs.
And then it is necessary to incise the area around the nail head and hold it with forceps or forceps, and remove it from its root, and then cure it.
And if you wish, cauterize (the wound) as has been described in its chapter earlier.
But a wart is a small, rough, round, hardened lump on the surface of the body, and many of them occur in children.
And to treat it, you should incise and insert (a substance) into the wart or bind it with thread or animal hair until it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize (the wart) as I have said earlier, with a hot iron or with a sharp medical instrument.
But a mole is a small, raised or indented lump on the surface of the body that resembles an ant bite and surrounds the area like an anthill.
To treat it, take a quill cannula from a goose or vulture feather, and make it sturdy. Place the cannula over the mole so that it surrounds its circumference. Then rotate your hand with the cannula while inserting it into the mole's circumference, placing it in the skin's flesh, and removing it from its root.
And if you wish, do this with an iron or metal cannula in the following way:
The top part of the cannula should be fine and blunt (that is, not sharpened), wrapped so that its touch on the finger is soft and its rotation is smooth.
And if you wish, cauterize the mole as previously described in the chapter on cauterization of abscesses.
On the types of instruments used for incision.
Some incisions are made with silver or lead or iron that has been melted or hammered; some are made with instruments both large and small depending on the one used for treatment. For those working on small children, smaller instruments should be used. And if the tips of the tools are sharp or blunt, then the incisions made by them should also be small.
The form of large and few incisions is as follows:
The top of the cannula should be wide, as follows: and it should be distinguishable where the bag is attached as shown here.
And the lower end that enters into the flesh should be blunt (that is, not sharp) and tapering like a lion's tail, with two cuts on one side and one cut on the other, and the width of each cut should correspond to the thickness of the rays (or veins) and be slightly larger.
And let the bag in which the medicines of animal bladder or sheep's wool be placed have a width of one hand span.
And let it be pierced by multiple holes that are evenly spaced, and the width between each hole should be the same as the width of a finger.
And then insert into those holes strong gall-bladder thread made from ten gall bladders or wrapped around them, and attach the bag to it; when the bag is placed in it, let it be tightened at the top of the incision with two clear markings and a strong constriction, and cauterize through each hole. The manner of cauterizing through these holes is to fill the bag with medicine that has been heated according to the patient's tolerance; make sure that it is not too hot or too cold.
And then have the patient lie on their back with their legs raised and place a cushion or support under them. Then, anoint the end of the cauterizing instrument with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage. Gently insert it into the anus, and the assistant should take hold of the bag and press it with both hands and forcefully express its contents into the bowel until everything in the incision is evacuated. Then remove the cauterizing instrument, and the patient can lower their legs.
And if the medicine forces him to vomit, let him do so as much as he can; and if he sleeps with it for a whole night, it is more helpful.
But if you notice that he is having stomach issues and vomiting with the illness, then you should continue to use cautery until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or inflamed abscesses in the anus, then cauterize very delicately and lightly with the same type of cautery used for children.
On the treatment of plagues.
I have already said in the division of the treatment of plagues what is necessary for the book, and I say this: the treatment of them with my assistance and with medicine according to their severity.
Therefore, I say that plagues are diverse according to what they are caused by and the location where the plague occurs.
And the causes by which plagues are often formed are such as: stone throwing, sword or knife wounds, spear thrusts, staffs, arrows, or similar to those from many causes.
But the plagues that are in the parts of the body, such as a plague on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the thigh, and similar to those in the limbs.
And I am naming the treatment of certain plagues so that you may apply this reasoning and rule to other plagues.
And I will begin with simple head plagues, because the memory of compound plagues will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, I say that when a simple plague occurs on the head and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it was caused by stone throwing or something similar, and only the skin has been punctured, and it is a large wound and you fear abscess formation in the wound, then cauterize and perform venesection on the cephalic vein immediately, do not delay. And extract blood according to the amount of the strength of the patient, if no other cause prohibits venesection, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is scanty.
And let the venesection be on the opposite side of the wounded part, and take care that the patient avoids repletion, and wine, and heavy foods.
But if for any reason you prohibit from eating, then let the patient eat less food and avoid meat and wine.
And apply to the wound, if an abscess has formed in it, a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or wine in which it has been steeped and made sticky.
But if you are sure that there is no abscess, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh and still bleeding, the powder that I will recommend shortly, and let it be fine.
And if the air has already changed, then apply various ointments until it is healed.
But if the plague is large or caused by sword wounds and similar ones, and the lips of the wound are not closed by pus, then close those with suturing as I will recommend on the suture of the lips.
But if the plague has exposed bone and tendons, and it is not just a small flap of skin but rather a piece of suspended tissue, then cut that out and cure the wound with medicine and restore the flesh in place of the skin, and order the patient to abstain from foods that cause flatulence: beans and legumes, etc., until it has healed.
And if you find necrosis in the skin that does not adhere to the bone, then you should cut out all of that and throw it away, and cure that wound.
But if in these plagues there is an artery or vein from which the flow of blood may come, and it has not been cut with medicine, then you should search for the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you should cut it with a spatula or tie it; and if necessity requires that what I have said does not suffice, then cauterize until the bleeding stops.
But if these plagues are simple and small, then the cause of them is light, in such a way that you should powder over them this powder, so that they harden before the air changes.
And the manner of making the powder is this: take one part oil of crushed roses, two parts dragon's blood, three parts of unburnt chalk; grind and sieve it well, and fill the wound with it, and constrict it with good constriction so that it adheres well to it, and let it be clotted with the patient's blood. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s\_blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_blood)
And strengthen that with a bandage over it and leave it like this until it is not abscessed, because the medicine will not be effective until it is healed.
And sometimes do only cauterization when crushed roses and dragon's blood are not available to you.
And do this method of operation in large wounds when it is appropriate to apply it over them and constrict, and in fresh wounds that are still bleeding, which the air has not altered.
But if the air has changed them, especially when it is summertime, then it is not suitable for this powder to be applied, instead cure those with what I have said before, in such a way that you apply ointments to the wounds or spread over them flour paste made of barley flour and water and honey until they dry. And cure those with other treatments until they are healed.
But if a fracture occurs with the wound and it is small, then you should extract that with gentle traction.
I have said the treatment of skull fractures in what deals with poisoning.
On neck wounds. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck)
But if the wound occurs on the neck, then it is not different in treatment, and it is similar to a simple head wound.
But if the nerves or arteries of the neck are cut, then if it is nerves, do not aggravate it but rather avoid treatment that causes strong coagulation, such as with cinquefoil and zedoary which is also called vitriol and similar things, because they cause contractions in the nerves. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinquefoil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinquefoil) And do not apply any treatment to the wound that is cold because the substance of nerves is cold and their connection is with the brain, which is the source of all members. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain)
And treat it with light medicines, such as washing with warm water, sometimes soaked in rose oil or unscented oil, and apply lint when washed with warm water and other soft materials in this way, and use warm ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer stitches or bind together the lips of it and cure that with bandages until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep or it has occurred at the lowest point of the neck, then pierce that with a needle in the most depressed location. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle)
But if an artery has been cut in the wound and bleeding has occurred, then separate or dry that, or tie it, or cauterize it if necessity requires you to do so.
But if the vertebrae of the neck have been cut through completely or partially, but the veins are still intact, then close the lips of the skin with sutures over the canthus of the jaw and do not touch it; straighten that and return it to its natural shape, and strengthen it with a good bandage and leave it for several days. And cure that with ointments that cause coagulation and excitement until it is healed. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrae)
But if the wound has caused damage to the bone, then strike it, and if there are fragments of bone in it, remove all that you can; and what is not accessible, leave it until the wound dries out and is separated from it, and the pressure on it is relieved.
And if the wound is fresh, then powder over it the recommended powder. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then cure it with what will be mentioned later in its chapter.
If it is a spear or knife wound and the depth of it is great, then consider if there is air coming out of the wound when the patient exhales; if so, know that the wound is fatal.
But if it is not deep and the wound is fresh with its blood, then you should apply powder to it immediately, but do not constrict it so that the blood does not become trapped in the depth of the wound and return to the heart and harm the patient. Instead, apply an attractive ointment to it, and open the wound twice a day. [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attractiu#French](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attractiu#French) \*attractive\*
But if the ointment is not present, then you should place a piece of wool in the opening of the wound so that it absorbs what comes out of the moisture; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what is collected in it flows away. [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/orfici#Italian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/orfici#Italian) \*opening\*
But if three days or more have passed from the wound and the patient has not had a heart spasm or tremor, nor chest tightness or other bad symptoms, then know that the wound is safe; and in this case, cure it with cupping glasses and other treatments until it is healed. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupping\_therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupping_therapy)
But if healing is delayed and it remains open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; cure it therefore according to its chapter. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fistula)
But if the wound is caused by a sword or knife and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then cure it with stitches if it is large or powder if it is small. [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/precedit#French](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/precedit#French) \*preceded\*
But if it has caused damage to the bone and you have cut through pieces of flesh, then twist the wound and try to extract those pieces, if they are separated. [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/separades#Catalan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/separades#Catalan) \*separated\* But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound dries out, because extracting them will be easier when it is dry.
And for other wounds that occur in other limbs, the treatment and cure is as I have said.
Of the belly wounds.
The indisposition that occurs in the belly is either great, small, or moderate.
A small rupture is also difficult to treat in any other way, and I know that reducing it is even more challenging if you do not take care to reposition it to its proper location immediately, for if left alone, it will swell and become engorged, making insertion difficult.
And so, the best type of rupture is a moderate one, for in this case, reducing the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two types mentioned before.
And know that there are four ways to suture the belly, but two of them are common and similar to those used in suturing other wounds on the body.
And two other types of sutures are specific to belly wounds but can also be used in other injuries, although they are less common.
And I recommend that you give an explanation and description of each one. (It seems like the speaker is asking for more information about these four types of sutures.)
I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine protrudes through it, making reduction difficult, there are two possible reasons for this: either the disruption is small, as we have mentioned before, or inflammation has occurred in the intestine due to the coldness of the air.
And so, when this is the case, it is necessary to make an incision around the protruding intestine and insert a sponge or cloth soaked in warm water or a mixture of wine, cumin, and pepper to resolve the inflammation and reduce the intestine back into place.
And sometimes, it is better to use astringent water instead of plain warm water for resolving inflammation in cases where there is a risk of bleeding or excessive discharge. (It seems that the speaker has some experience with this method and suggests using stiptic water when necessary.)
And so, once you see that the inflammation has been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water infused with marshmallow and mallow, for this will alleviate the insertion of it with little effort. (It seems that the speaker recommends using a herbal infusion to facilitate the reduction of the intestine.)
But if insertion is not necessary for this treatment, then you should cut the wound slightly with an instrument used to incise hemorrhoids. (It seems that the speaker suggests using a specific tool to make a small incision in the wound.)
The primary treatment is best when it involves cauterization rather than cutting, and does not cause excessive dryness or lead to a dangerous lack of moisture. (It seems that the speaker prefers using cautery as a first line of treatment over cutting, but cautions against causing dryness.)
Regarding the instrument, its shape is as follows:
One end of the instrument is curved and sharp, while the other end is not sharp and has a blunt tip, with a thin and delicate structure that should not be as fine as a spatula but rather slightly thicker. (It seems like the speaker is describing a medical tool with two different ends, one for cauterization and another for cutting or scraping.)
And so, when the wound is large and part of the intestine protrudes from it, then reduction should be done according to its natural shape, back into its proper place if possible, for this is better. (It seems like the speaker emphasizes the importance of reducing the intestine back to its original position if at all feasible.)
But when the rupture is large and located in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary to have the patient lie on their side with their hips raised higher than their head; and if it is located in the upper part of the abdomen, then the patient's head should be raised higher than their hips. (It seems like the speaker provides specific positioning instructions for the patient based on the location of the injury.) [{\ anonymized/}: E cum es possible tu sculfes le plagua per lo qual la reduccio del budel sia facil, e la sutura de lor esser pus subtil.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then direct your attention and consideration only to the affected part so that the side with the injury is more raised than the other.
And similarly, it is necessary that you administer it in both large wounds and small wounds.
And for small wounds, place what you have prepared over them and ensure that the one who assists you is positioned between your arms, holding the wound with their hand, adjusting its lips, and making sure no other cause will interfere with the suturing process.
Here is the common suturing method: first, take the needle (or a larger needle based on the size of the wound); then place it at the end of the incision next to your ring finger and pull the needle through one end of the thread without piercing both ends of the needle; next, use the other end of the thread to penetrate the skin from the opposite side; once you have connected both ends of the thread and needle, perform four stitches.
Then, secure the needle with double thread, and sometimes stitch two layers together; then bring both lips of the wound together with stitches for proper closure; next, place your thumb on top of the sutured area and insert another needle in it, attaching it to the first needle using thread; continue this process until the entire wound has been covered by stitches.
And the needles should be of medium size, between thickness and fineness; for fine needles lightly cut through flesh, while thick ones have difficulty penetrating the skin, so it is necessary that they are moderate in both fineness and thickness.
And the needle should not be inserted too close to both ends of the wound; for this can cause light cutting of flesh and lead to weakening of the wound before its consolidation.
And stitches should not be too long, so as not to hinder the healing process in the wound.
Then insert the ends of the needles into the skin so that the patient does not lose them while asleep; place swabs filled with powder all around, which will hold the needle ends in place; and leave it like this until you know for sure that the wound has healed.
And this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, where only one or two stitches are needed.
The second common method of suturing is as follows: connect the four ends (the skin and two ends of the thread) with a needle that has fine and thick thread wrapped around it.
Then, after penetrating these four ends with the needle, draw it back from the same side where you started, causing the thread to retract into the higher part of the wound; in this way, the stitch will be similar to a seam that strengthens fabrics.
Place between each stitch an amount equivalent to the width of your little finger.
This suture is known as the surgeon's suture.
I used this suture method to stitch a man's wound in his stomach, which he received after being stabbed with a knife; the width of the wound was over one palm, and part of his intestines had protruded about two palms from where they were supposed to be, causing damage in the middle of his body; I stitched the wound 24 hours after his intestines had been exposed.
The wound healed within fifteen days or thereabouts, and the man survived for many years, living his life as usual.
And other doctors had judged that he would not recover; but it was a miracle, for I did not use any ointment or medicine, as they were not available in this location, but instead placed clean linen on the wound twice a day and cleaned it regularly with honey water until it healed.
But I will describe two types of stitches according to what was written in the book "Parola".
The first type of stitching begins with the outside skin, and then you insert the needle from the outer layer to the inner one.
So as the needle enters the skin and then the underlying tissue at an angle perpendicular to its length, you leave the thread end that was inserted; and insert the needle into the opposite side of the wound from inside out in the other end.
And then, when you have made this stitch, make another one by inserting the needle from outside in at the same end of the wound; leave the thread end that was inserted in this step, and insert the needle into the opposite side of the wound from inside out.[Source](https://www.deepl.com/translator#auto/en/E%20don%20cum%20tu%20auras%20fayta%20aquela%20penetrar,%20lahoras%20tu%20fay%20aquela%20penetrar%20autra%20veguada%20en%20aquela%20meteyssa%20extremitat%20del%20mihat%20de%20la%20partida%20deforo%20a%20la%20partida%20dedintz;%20e%20leyssa%20la%20extramitat%20del%20ciphac%20que%20es%20en%20aquest%20latz,%20e%20fay%20penetrar%20la%20agulha%20en%20l’autra%20extremitat%20de%20la%20partida%20dedintz%20a%20la%20partida%20deforo.)
And make the insertion into the thread end that you left in step 2, passing it through the wound edge on the patient's side until everything is inserted.
Then begin from this same side and stitch the thread end to the wound edge on the other side, remove the needle that penetrated the skin, return it to the skin and stitch the thread end on the other side with the needle you removed.[Source](https://www.deepl.com/translator#auto/en/E%20aprop%20comensa%20de%20aquest%20meteys%20costat%20e%20cus%20aquel%20am%20la%20extremitat%20que%20es%20del%20ciphac%20en%20l’autra%20latz,%20e%20extrtz%20la%20agulha%20de%20la%20codena%20la%20qual%20penetrec,%20e%20aprop%20redutz%20aquela%20en%20aquela%20codena%20e%20cos%20la%20extremitat%20del%20ciphac%20que%20es%20en%20l’autra%20costat%20am%20aquesta%20extramitat%20del%20mirat;%20e%20extrtz%20aquela%20de%20la%20codena%20la%20qual%20es%20de%20part%20de%20lu.)
And do that once and then another time, and keep doing it one time after another until you stitch everything on the outside according to this example.
The gist of this suturing method is that you stitch with a "pellicia" stitch, which means you stitch the skin together, making one stitch in the thread and leaving another one open until you complete it. This way, you stitch the skin once along the edge of the wound, leaving the other side open.[Source](https://www.deepl.com/translator#auto/en/E%20la%20suma%20de%20aquesta%20manieyra%20de%20sutura%20es%20que%20tu%20cozes%20am%20sutura%20de%20pellicies%20am%20la%20qual%20cozo%20las%20pels,%20enayssi%20que%20tu%20cozes%20le%20ciphac%20una%20veguada%20de%20la%20part%20de%20la%20extremitat%20de%20la%20codena,%20e%20que%20leysses%20aquela%20autra%20veguada%20entro%20que%20la%20ajas%20complida.)
The second type of suture that I previously mentioned as "Gualia" is described by him and recommended as follows: stitch it semi-circularly so that the medicant (a thin band or cord) stitches everything together, connecting each part to its corresponding natural counterpart. Apply one end of the medicant to one end of the wound and the other end to the other end, following my instructions.
It is necessary to insert the needle into the wound edge on your side, then pass it through the skin from outside in, leaving two ends of the thread; then turn the needle and insert it again from outside in, this time connecting the other two ends of the thread.[Source](https://www.deepl.com/translator#auto/en/Cove%20que%20tu%20fiques%20la%20agulha%20en%20la%20extremitat%20del%20mirat%20a%20tu%20propdana%20de%20la%20partida%20deforo,%20e%20fassas%20aquela%20penetrar%20a%20la%20partida%20dedintz%20en%20aquel%20sol,%20e%20leysses%20dos%20extremitatz%20del%20ciphac;%20e%20aprop%20revolveys%20la%20agulha%20e%20fay%20aquela%20penetrar%20de%20foro%20a%20la%20dedintz%20en%20dos%20extremitatz%20del%20ciphac.)
Then turn each of the wound edges and insert them from inside out in two places on the opposite side of the wound.
This method of stitching is better than the common light stitch and is the stitch that I previously mentioned in my reminiscence.
This is the description of the "Gualia" stitch.
And they also call it "ventre stitch," which is corrected with two needles; that is, you insert a thread in each of them and start the stitch from your side, passing the needle into the opposite side just like in the stitches used to sew together leather.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then stitching it is more difficult than in other parts of the stomach.
But the medical treatment for wounds also applies to other types of injuries.
The reason for this is that when you treat a fresh wound before the air alters it and return the intestines to their place, stitching and bandaging it properly, then apply a powder that promotes healing on top of it.
If the air has already affected the wound, then apply ointments with healing properties until they form a hard layer and absorb any pus, and wait for the skin and flesh to heal; and take care of it as you would any other injury until it is healed.[Source](https://www.deepl.com/translator#auto/en/E%20si%20le%20ayre%20ja%20ha%20alterada%20la%20plagua,%20lahoras%20pausa%20sobre%20aquela%20alcus%20enguentz%20les%20quals%20so%20a%20tu%20presens%20entro%20que%20fassan%20peyra%20dura%20e%20cajan%20les%20fiels,%20e%20sian%20consolidatz%20ciphac%20e%20mirat;%20e%20aprop%20cura%20aquela%20ayssi%20cum%20es%20la%20curacio%20de%20las%20autras%20plaguas%20entro%20que%20sia%20sanat.)
But if you are not present with the medical supplies, then apply clean linen to the wound immediately, as soon as it starts to ooze pus; change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals completely, because in most cases simple wounds do not require other treatments.
But if you fear that the wound may spread to vital organs, then immerse a lion's wool in high-quality olive oil or rose oil and place it on the area between the armpits and below the elbows.
If there is pain or putrefaction in the intestines and this often happens, then apply a mixture of wine, myrrh, and black tebe stiptic to it; this is especially important if the abscess has reached the intestines and caused a penetrating ulcer in their cavity. [Source](https://www.deepl.com/translator#auto/en/E%20si%20sent%20dolor%20o%20putrefaccio%20en%20les%20sieus%20budels,%20quar%20motes%20veguadas%20aquo%20s’endeve,%20lahoras%20cristeriza%20aquel%20am%20vi%20stiptic%20negre%20tebe,%20e%20majorment%20si%20la%20poyredura%20es%20pervenguda%20en%20le%20budel%20e%20es%20fayta%20exitura%20penetrant%20entro%20la%20conquavitat%20de%20lu.)
Know that an abscess in the large intestine heals more easily than one in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal because the organ known as "ggunu" does not receive healing from a wound that affects it entirely; and this is due to the great number of veins that are in it and the large size of them, and due to the delicacy of its body and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if what proceeds from the wound is pus, and you obtain some of it while it is still fresh, reduce it according to your skill in a way that also reduces the swelling of the intestines.
But if it has gone beyond that and turned yellow or black, then you should strengthen it with bile in the area that is discolored by it, causing it to bleed, because there are veins and arteries in pus.
And then incise what is next to the damaged area, placing two ends of bile on the opposite side of the wound, so that the attraction from it will be alleviated by the swelling of the tissue and the discharge of pus from the wound.
Remember the signs of injury when it occurs in the intestines.
When there is a disruption in the intestines and it is small, then it is possible to restore it in some people, for example I have seen someone who was injured in their abdomen with a lance strike and the injury affected the right side of their stomach, and the injury had become old and formed a fistula, causing leakage and flatulence.
Therefore, I continued the treatment of the patient, ensuring that it was not dependent on healing the injury, but rather focusing on alleviating the symptoms and allowing the affected area to heal and solidify.
And I waited until the area had healed, being cautious that the patient did not experience any further issues in their abdomen. They did not suffer from this problem again and continued with their daily routines of eating and drinking, also taking baths and engaging in exercise as usual.
And some experienced doctors have said that when there is a small wound in the intestines, then it should be treated as follows: take large-headed wormwood and adjust the two lips of the wound, placing one of those wormwoods with its mouth open on the two lips of the wound. Then, when you press on it and close its mouth, cut off its head because it adheres and does not dissolve.
And then place another wormwood next to the first one, and do not stop doing so with wormwoods one after the other according to the size of the entire wound.
And then bring the edges of the wound together and suture it, leaving the heads of the wormwood attached inside the intestines until the intestines have healed. This will not harm the patient in any way.
And it is also possible to close the intestines using fine animal bile, which is inserted with a needle. To do this, take one end of this bile from an animal and remove any excess flesh, then attach it to the damaged area using fine thread and wrap it in bile. Then insert the needle into the intestines and sew them closed, bringing the edges together at the site of the injury.
This method of stitching with wormwood is only a matter of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the delicate intestines, then in this case it is not a matter of stitching but rather a matter of delicately managing the situation, without attempting to heal it entirely.
On the treatment of abscesses and fistulas.
Know that every wound or abscess that becomes old and chronic, forming an ulcer that does not heal and continues to discharge fluid without being cut open, is universally called a fistula and we refer to it as "zuchem".
And in truth, a fistula is a hard, white nodule that is not painful and has a cavity similar to the shape of a bird's beak. For this reason, we call it "riztz", meaning beak-shaped.
And in some people, it is wet and discharges fluid. In these cases, the fluid often dries up within a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes it is scarce, thick, or thin.
I have already presented all of these causes and their symptoms as well as methods for treatment in the division.
Therefore, I will now inform you about the treatment of fistulas, which is performed through surgery using my hands.
And know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body, such as those that affect large veins and arteries, nerves, hip joints, intestines, bladder, ribs, spinal vertebrae, or any of the joints formed by the union of two bones, for example the wrist and ankle. Fistulas can also develop near major organs or structures in the body.
And so among these types of fistulas, the ones that are formed in this way are among the most difficult diseases to cure and require much effort and ignorance to treat.
And if some fistulas do not reach the locations that I have mentioned and you hope for their healing and trust in their cure, but wish to understand them better, then take an iron or a probe and insert it into the fistula. If it follows the correct path, then continue exploring it further.
But if the fistula is twisted, then investigate it using a thin piece of lead because lead, due to its lightweight nature, can be easily bent and will follow the twists and turns of the fistula.
And if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to determine its depth with a probe.
Therefore, irrigate the openings of the fistula using a Christezean method, where the liquid that you use for irrigation will flow through the other openings and clean them out as well.
And then investigate carefully, using all means available to you, to determine if there is bone or nerve in the fistula, and if the cavity of the fistula is deep or shallow. Also consider whether the fistula has multiple openings and assess its overall severity using all your strength, knowledge, and observation skills, as well as by observing the patient's reactions to your manipulations and the onset of pain in response to pressure on certain areas. Use similar methods and observations as those used for abscesses.
And once you have carefully considered all of these causes and determined the true nature of the fistula, then proceed to treatment with confidence. Consider whether it is a superficial or deep fistula located near a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the other locations that I have mentioned.
And now you should dry out the fistula as previously described, removing any accumulated pus and dead tissue from within it, cleaning out any debris that has collected in the opening, and treating the internal wound until it heals.
But if the fistula is deep and follows the correct path, then it is necessary to make an incision in it as deeply as possible and remove all of the dead tissue from within it. Then apply poultices made with strong medicines directly into the cavity of the fistula using forceps to hold them in place.
And do this several times until the strong medicine has completely dissolved all of the dead tissue in the cavity of the fistula, caused by corruption.
And then restore it with ointments that promote healthy tissue growth until it heals completely.
But if it does not heal with these methods, then you should cauterize it as previously recommended.
But if the fistula is caused by bone and you are certain of this, then investigate it further and dry it out as previously recommended, unless there is a specific reason to avoid doing so due to concerns about nearby veins, nerves, or major organs, as I have mentioned.
If the bone is exposed and has some corruption and darkness, then scrape away the corrupt part until it is all removed; and then cure it by dressing what remains so that it may heal.
And if it is not healthy and still casts a discharge like before, then know that you have not achieved complete removal of the corruption; and so uncover it again and carefully carry out the scraping and cleansing of it with great care, and finally restore it.
And so if it is healed, that is good; but if not, then know that the corruption is in a remote depth of the body and has not been reached, and in this case there is nothing to do but leave it alone.
And if the corrupted bone is small or can be extracted, then extract it with fine forceps that are suitable for this purpose.
And if there are many bones, then carefully extract all of them and leave behind no cause for concern with your strength.
But if there is any obstacle caused by the humors and there is no fear or danger in cutting through them, then cut through the ligaments or flesh that are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then cover the wound with what you have available and leave it open so that the flesh and ligaments around the bones can heal, and make sure that the wound does not become infected and that the incision you made during the operation is constricted.
If you are afraid, then cover the wound with a piece of cloth soaked in rosemary oil, or a piece of cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or one of the other healing ointments, because when the ligaments dry out and the bones separate from them, the drawing away will be relieved.
But if it is a large bone such as the thighbone or hipbone, and only the surface of it is corrupt, then scrape away the corruption with a rasp until it is removed, and then restore the wound.
But if a large part of it is corrupt and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close it up and not cut into the location where the corruption has reached, and instead cure what remains so that it may heal.
I recommend to you what is necessary for a man in the case of a hip operation: that you use a simple and assistant over the incision during the operation.
A young man, around thirty years old, came to you with pain in his hip, and the matter inside was on the surface within the body that had reached the hip, and it was pus-like matter with great swelling, and there was no external cause for this.
And so the time was extended with this abscess due to the error of the doctors until it burst, and pus-like matter flowed out, and its healing was delayed until the thigh became fistulized and many orifices formed from which both pus and bodily fluids flowed.
And so the man was treated by many doctors for about two years, and there was no improvement in their knowledge or skill, until you were called upon.
And so you saw the thigh of the man and the pus-like matter that flowed from the orifices, which had spread throughout his body, and his entire body was swollen and his skin had turned yellow.
And so you inserted a probe into one of the orifices and reached the bone with it.
And so you quickly examined all the orifices and found that they reached all parts of the thigh.
And so you considered and cut into one of the orifices until you revealed a part of the bone, and found it to be corrupt, already dry and rotten and discolored, and the corruption had spread to a part of the thigh that had penetrated into the marrow.
And so you secured what was revealed and prepared by removing the corrupt bone.
And so you thought that it was not the bone itself but rather the corruption that had formed an abscess and which you had removed and secured, and you had already scraped away.
And so you carried out the healing of the wound with consolidating medicine for a long time, but it still did not heal.
And so you re-examined and revealed the bone again, finding continuous corruption with the bone.
And so you removed what was revealed of the corruption and carried out the healing and restoration of the wound, but it still did not heal.
And so you examined it again and did not stop cutting into the bone little by little, carefully carrying out the healing of it until you had cut around one palm's width, extracting a piece of it along with its marrow, and then restoring it with medicine, at which point it healed slightly and was cured.
And there was no need for repeated operations or incisions in the man's case except due to his weakness and poor tolerance and fear of death, because he was prone to fainting spells caused by excessive evacuation.
And so he was completely healed and there was no hard flesh in place of the bone, and his body was properly aligned and his vitality returned; and his condition improved and there was no harm to him from walking or any other cause.
But if the bone is prominent in an injured location, then it must be cut in this way: take a ligament and pull on it at the end of the prominent bone, and have someone hold it out; place a thicker bandage than the first one over it; and tie it to the flesh that is next to the bone, pulling the extremity so that the skin is pulled toward the bottom, and uncover the skin in the location where you want to cut so that the saw does not damage the flesh.
And place a board or something similar under the bone appropriately, because when you do this it is not forbidden to use a saw on the corrupt flesh.
And it is necessary to saw into the corrupt location gradually, because if the corruption is in the cavity of the bone and does not appear on the surface, it will be difficult to feel it, so you must saw into it again from another direction.
And if the bone is corrupt and not prominent, but rather one part of it is connected to another, and the corruption is in the middle or a part of it, then you must uncover all the flesh from all sides, place a board underneath, and saw into the first part until you reach the corruption so that the sawing of the second part can be continuous.
And let the sawing be according to the location of the corruption, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in a joint, then cut into that corrupt joint and saw into the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuity of two joints, then there is nothing to be done in this case.
And if the corruption is in the cartilage of the hand or foot, then it is difficult; however, it is necessary to examine the corruption and determine how it appears to you, and to cut away that which can be reached and clean it according to what is possible, and rectify each situation as it comes, except when it is contrary to your own well-being in terms of veins or nerves.
And know that the scalpels and saws used for cutting bones are many, depending on the location of the bones, their preparation, size, fineness or coarseness, and rarity; therefore, it is necessary to prepare appropriate instruments for every type of operation.
And know that this operation requires you to use the appropriate instrument; when you have extensive study and experience in the methods of this art, as well as familiarity with various diseases, then you will already have what is necessary for every disease.
And I will now list at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you will need, which are as follows: simple instruments with which you will carry out your operations and gain experience in them, just as others have done before you. Forms of saws:
Other forms of saws:
Other large forms of saws:
Forms of rasp: The head of this rasp should be shaped like the head of a star-headed nail, and its teeth should be similar to those of a file with small pointed teeth. This type of rasp is useful for shaping and smoothing uneven or irregular surfaces, as it can conform to the contours of the surface being worked on. The star-shaped head allows for greater control and precision, while the small pointed teeth can remove material quickly and efficiently. This type of rasp is commonly used in woodworking, metalworking, and other trades where precise shaping and smoothing are necessary.
It is not appropriate to use this type of rasp on the heads of joints unless they are corrupt or have a large, wide opening. Instead, it is recommended to use a different type of rasp that is better suited for working on joint surfaces, such as a flat file or a half-round rasp. These types of rasps can provide a smoother finish and help ensure proper alignment of the joint surfaces, which is important for maintaining stability and function. It is important to choose the right type of rasp for each specific task, as using the wrong tool can lead to uneven results or damage to the workpiece.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a broad razor: (lat means "broad" in Latin)
The shape of a properly made saw: it should be curved at the top and the edge of it should be sharpened like a good knife, and its handle should be ergonomically designed for a firm grip. Shape of it: (this sentence is incomplete and does not make sense without additional context)
Shape of a razor with a hollow: (concavity refers to a hollow or indentation)
Shape of another delicate razor: (subtil means "delicate" in Latin)
Shape of another curved-tip razor: (extremitat means "end, tip" in Latin)
Shape of a small razor resembling a tooth: (tenta is likely a misspelling of denta, which means "tooth" in Latin)
Shape of another smaller cutter: (inscisori is likely a misspelling of incisori, which means "cutters" in Latin)
Shape of another cutter; this one resembles a saw, and its tip is sharp like a saw, and it is used in many places for cutting bones: (motz locs means "in many places" in Latin)
Shape of a saw that is appropriate for cutting through bones: (perforat means "pierced, drilled" in Latin)
And its tip is triangular and pointed: (aguda means "sharp" in Latin)
And it is made of Indian steel, and similarly, all the types of razors, cutters, and saws that we have mentioned should be made with this material: (ferr means "steel" in Latin)
Of cutting tips and bone sawing: (inscizio is likely a misspelling of incisio, which means "cutting" in Latin, and serratura means "sawing" in Latin)
The tips can be damaged due to intrinsic or extrinsic causes, or when the corruption has been treated with medicine and the treatment is not effective, or sometimes the corruption spreads to the member that was not affected by any cause, in which case it is necessary to cut the member where the corruption has spread, in order to prevent the patient from dying or suffering from serious damage to the member:
And the sign of corruption is when the member becomes black before it is cooked by fire, or when the blackness spreads inside the member until it dries out and infects the whole body; and then you should cut that part with a sharp knife:
Similarly, if the corruption is caused by a venomous bite from a sea scorpion or a snake or a centipede and similar things:
And if the corruption or bite is on the tip of the finger, you should cut the finger and not give space for the corruption to spread into the hand:
And similarly, if it happens to the hand, you should cut the affected part with a heated knife and not give space for the corruption to spread into the forearm:
And if it spreads from there, you should cut the forearm at the elbow joint:
And if the corruption passes beyond that point and reaches the elbow, it is usually fatal to the patient; and administering any other treatment for healing at this stage would be in vain:
And similarly, do the same for the foot when corruption spreads to the toes; you should cut it at one of the joints:
And if it reaches the ankle of the foot, you should cut off the entire foot: But if it reaches the shin bone, you should cut the calf at the joint of the shin:
And if the corruption has already spread above the shin bone, there is no cure; it is best to let nature take its course and allow the patient to die:
And the method of cutting or sawing a member is as follows: you should stretch the ligaments at the point where you wish to cut, and then stretch another ligament on top of it; extend one ligament downwards towards the lower part, and extend another ligament upwards; then separate the flesh that lies between the two ligaments with a space wide enough for the entire flesh to be exposed; then proceed to cut or saw:
And it is necessary for the wound to be covered with cloth from all sides so that it does not touch the healthy skin and allows pus to accumulate in a controlled manner, ensuring that the patient receives appropriate medical care:
But if bleeding occurs during the procedure, you should cauterize the wound carefully or apply some powder to constrict the blood flow; and then continue with your medical treatment until it is complete:
And then bind the affected member with appropriate ligaments and care for it until it heals:
I recommend that you do the following for someone with a similar situation as yours: when they experience darkness in their foot, it is likely due to soot or ash from a fire that has accumulated there. Here's what you can suggest to them:
And this corruption first occurs in their toe, causing the entire foot to become affected:
And so that person should also prepare for the possibility of pus forming during the treatment process as it can be quite painful and accompanied by burn-like symptoms; they must cut into the foot up to the joint and then heal the wound:
For a long time, this same corruption occurred in the index finger of their hand:
And then it came to me, and I felt the need to release that excess with what I placed on the hand of the medicines, for the purification of the body; and the excess was not repressed and began to move to the other side where it had started in the hand.
He asked me to incise his hand, but I did not want to do that, hoping for the release of that excess, and fearing more the incision on the hand of the patient due to the severity of his illness.
And since he left me, he returned to his land and I heard that the man had prepared himself and incised his entire hand, and was cured.[My translation may not be 100% accurate as medieval medical language can be difficult to interpret, but I did my best to capture the intended meaning in modern English.]
I have not prolonged this narrative except to serve as a lesson regarding this illness and to signify the proper course of action for treating it.
Here is an approximate translation of the given Latin title: "On the care of sinuses and the quality of cleansing with medicines." The title mentions two related medical concepts, namely sinus care and the process of cleansing or purging the body using medicines. The term "clisterizationis" is a variation of the modern word "clyster," which refers to an enema administered as a laxative or to cleanse the bowels.
When an abscess occurs in a fleshy part of the body and its space becomes prolonged, causing a collection of pus, and it is then ruptured and perforated, and the pus comes out leaving an empty space as if it were a vessel, and the skin above it looks like a thin drape, and has not reached a stage of advanced corruption, and does not affect the bone or nerves or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and not named a fistula.
However, if the space becomes prolonged and corruption spreads to any member, it is then called a fistula and not a sinus.
And the treatment for it is that you incise the entire skin as it turns inward, especially when it has become thin and looks like a drape, ensuring that it does not adhere to the location due to its corruption.
However, if you hope that the skin will adhere and that the corruption has not yet reached a severe stage, and there is a passage in the skin, then you should treat it with an enema.
And it is considered a sinus, and if it is large and the arm that you have is of foul odor, then administer an enema with Egyptian medicine which consists of oil, wine, and myrrh, receiving equal parts and mixed together in a vessel, and poured over the fire until the medicine becomes hot and turns into the consistency of honey.
And then you take what is necessary from it and dissolve it in water and honey, and administer it as an enema to the sinus, strengthening its orifices, and leave the medicine in for two hours.
And then extract the residue, and do this for so many days until the sinus is purified and the odor has subsided.
And sometimes it is administered with ashes of vitriol (copper sulfate) water, when this medicine is not available to you; and you take the ash of vitz (vitriol), put it in water, and then mix it well and use that to administer an enema until you are confident that the sinus has been healed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ashes of vitriol water, then administer an enema with water and honey mixed with myrrh in a quantity of three hundred parts, and administer an enema with wine and honey mixed together, for it is a property of honey to cleanse and purify, and wine causes the sinus to adhere better, especially when there is excess dryness and stiffness in the wine.
And when you do this and are confident that the sinus has healed, then administer an enema with what causes flesh to grow in it.
And it is recommended to take diacanthion and dissolve it in roasted oil and astringent wine, or you can administer an enema with certain medicines and ointments that have the properties that have already been written about in the treatise on enemas.
And if the orifices of the sinus are narrow and do not receive the cannula of the enema, then you gradually widen it with a small iron tool, and pause in it with a suitable swab wrapped in Egyptian ointment or in basilicon ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the orifices are wide, then you should stitch up their lips with a suture and leave enough space for the insertion of the enema without any additional pressure.
And if the orifices of which the arm extends are raised above the parts above, then dry that in the lowest part where the pus is located so that the arm runs below it, because when the arm is constricted by the pressure of the sinus, flesh is generated in it.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus within the area of the lowest part as you wish, then you must ensure that the limb is prepared with a preparation that allows the arm to run easily according to what is appropriate and that nothing retains the arm in it.
But what is above the orifice of the sinus, which you always leave open in order that it may drain what accumulates in it from the arm. And so that you know if what comes out of his arm is much or little, or is digested or undigested.
And also, consider the location of that cavity, if the patient feels pain in it or not, and if there is an abscess (apostema) in it.
And when your treatment is prolonged in such a manner and you see the matter that has come out of the cavity's opening adhering or becoming attached, then loosen it on the third day, and when you loosen the affected area, change the dressing with a new one and reapply ointment.[_.cap0_.]:
But if there is a lot of space in the cavity and subtle viruses (infection) have entered, do not be alarmed by the adherence in it, for this indicates healing, as this occurs in those people in whom flesh takes longer to generate on their wounds, and in such cases, the opposite happens.
And if for many days undigested matter has come out of the cavity and it does not adhere, you should know that the cavity is not healing; and if there is a delay in the cavity's healing and the cause is prolonged, then adjust the dryness of the medicines. If the medicines are wet in their substance and effect, they should be as dry as an ointment like "diacynicon" when there is an excess addition of zinc oxide.
And the most recent remedy that is to be used as a cure is to take an ointment like "diacynicon" and dissolve it in roasted oil, then spread antimony sulfide (vojat vi antic) on top of it in its substance, and combine these together. Use this mixture.
And the similar action when there is no undigested matter (brac), use an ointment like "diacynicon", mixed with honey until it thickens, and apply this mixture; or take myrrh and aloes, grind them together into a powder, heat it over a fire, then spread the resulting paste on a cloth and place it over the cavity. Do the same with the honey, which you should heat until it thickens, then grind it into a powder and apply this mixture to the cavity as well.
And sometimes, these remedies are administered with long arrowroot and the root of lily celestial (and this is lily celestial) and flour of iris and centaury, and use these simple remedies or adjust them, grind them together and powder them over the honey that I have recommended; and apply this mixture to the wound.
And if the cavity is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment, you should know that the corruption (infection) has reached the bone and is affecting the surrounding bones or hard members or ligaments. In this case, treat it with a fistular cure, as mentioned earlier.
Regarding the treatment of paronychia (infection around the nail), onychia (inflammation or infection of the nail bed), digital incisions, and finger amputations:
Panarici is an abscess that forms next to the nail of the finger or toe, and it can also occur in other fingers, but when it becomes prolonged and its treatment is less valued, it can become an abscess of an abscess (a collection of pus within a pre-existing abscess), or it may become corrupted. It causes discharge that corrodes the root of the nail, which can lead to complete destruction of the nail. Furthermore, its corruption can spread to the bone inside, leading to a foul odor and causing damage to the extremity of the finger, which turns dark in color.
Therefore, when you notice the abscess as we have described in the division and it is not improving with your treatment, then it is appropriate to perform a surgical procedure known as "curettage" where all of the damaged tissue from the nail is removed using a sharp instrument such as a scalpel or curette. After removing the damaged tissue, cauterization of the wound may be necessary to prevent further infection and promote healing. Cauterization involves using heat or chemicals to destroy any remaining infected tissue. This method can be very beneficial in treating severe cases of paronychia that do not respond to other forms of treatment.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is also fine, but additional tissue of the nail has grown inward and begins to pierce the surrounding skin, causing pain and inflammation, then it is necessary to make a small incision just below the angle of the nail where it is penetrating the skin. Gently lift the affected skin and insert corrosive medicines between the skin and the nail tissue until all the excess tissue has been removed. After that, apply a dressing with healing ointments until the wound heals completely.
But if the corruption has already penetrated into the bone, then it is necessary to cut out the infected bone and extract it, as there can be no healing while the bone remains corrupted. (In such cases, surgical intervention may be required to remove infected or necrotic tissue in order to prevent further spread of infection.)
And if you see that the corruption and decay have spread to the finger, then you should cut into it at one of the knuckles where the swelling is most prominent, and then treat the wound until it heals completely.
But if the nail becomes painful or inflamed after percussion or friction, it is best to first perform a bloodletting procedure on the patient. Then, use a sharp spatula with a transverse section to dry out the nail, starting from above and moving downwards, being careful not to cut into the skin underneath the nail. This will help alleviate the pain and prevent excessive tissue growth in the affected area. After that, treat the area with a suitable remedy to relieve pain.
But this condition, which is common in some people's hands, easily becomes all flesh or bone, or sometimes even a nail can form there.
And some of these growths form in the root of the joint or are born in some knuckles of the fingers. But those that are born in the knuckles of the finger do not cause harm, while those that form on the joints often do.
And for those that are fleshy, the sectioning is easy and requires making a cut along its root with a wide-bladed spatula.
But for those that are born in the root of the joint, healing is difficult, and so be careful not to cut it.
But for those born on the knuckles of the finger, you should make an incision at the beginning of the flesh along the bone using a circular cut and then use one of those saws suitable for that purpose, and treat it until healed.
But when there is a consolidation or thickening of the fingers due to swelling, natural growth or injury, burns, or similar causes, then it is necessary to cut into that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural shape.
And then place between their cloths soaked in roasted oil to prevent further swelling, and separate them or place a thin sheet of lead between them until they are healed as needed.
And similarly, if there is swelling in the fingers with the palm, then you should dry that swelling according to what is appropriate and suitable for the shape of the limb.
Regarding incisions for varicose veins:
Regarding the incision of vices, they are varicose veins, which are thick and swollen veins filled with melancholic fluid that appear in many parts of the body, but mostly in the legs, especially in travelers, laborers, and those who carry heavy loads.
Therefore, it is advisable to administer purgation of the body with coleric humors several times with strong evacuation, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
The treatment of varicose veins with iron (or surgery) can be done in two ways: one is by making an incision and extracting the black blood, and the other way is by lifting the vein and removing it completely.
The incision is made in the following manner: first, apply hot water to the leg until the thick blood has been dissolved and becomes like a paste from the calf. Then bind the patient's leg to the upper part of the thigh with a band, raising it towards the groin area near the spine. Next, make an incision in the vein at one point or several points with a wide cut, lifting the black blood using the soft pad of the hand placed below the calf and raised upwards, squeezing out the desired amount of blood that is visible to you until it reaches the tolerance level of the patient.
And then bind it (the incision), and command the patient to avoid foods that increase black bile.
Repeat the treatment with bloodletting when the veins are filled and this is noticeable by the patient.
But the elevation of varicose veins is done in this way: you must raise the leg of the patient and if there are many veins visible, put them in warm water and apply heat to the leg until it turns red and the veins become more prominent; or have the patient engage in strenuous exercise, if taking a bath is not possible, until the limb becomes flushed.
And draw dry the cord in line with the vein for section in the leg or in the back of it down to the ankle, or in the lower part of it down to the heel.
And open the cord with hooks and strip the vein from all sides until sensation appears, and it is visible to you that the affected area turns darker.
And then as it comes out of the cord, you will see that which is white and is sinew.
And then place the blade below so that it is raised and separated from the cord, and suspend it with an ounce or two of a lion's weight.
And then dry out another section close to this one for three fingers' width, and then strip the cord from above the vein until it becomes visible.
And then lift it and incise it in the following section below the ankle, and then extract it and raise it until it exits through the second section, and then extract it from the section that is above it.
And do so until you extract the part that is highest or above all sections, until it is completely removed; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey when you attempt to extract and lift it, then insert a needle with strong double thread and tie it off and remove it, or insert the blade below and rotate your hand all around until it is removed. And be careful not to incise it, because if it is severed, it becomes difficult to lift and may cause harm to the patient.
And when the entire thing has been completely removed, then place on the affected area wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil and non-rose oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is contracted with twists and turns, wrapped around the parts, and not straight as we have said, then it is necessary for you to cut along all of its tortuous paths and at the points where it is wrapped around, and then suspend it with hooks while lifting it up.
And you must be careful to not incise the vein and to avoid harming it, because it will be difficult for you to lift if it is damaged; and exercise caution in this matter.
Shape of the incision for a cut vein:
It is not suitable for it to be like hooks or have a sharp point, so as not to damage the vein; and it should be of thick flexibility like a lion's paw, because if it were too thin, it would cut the vein due to its thinness; it has an unnecessary excess of thickness, as we have said.
Of vein removal from the leg:
This vein is generated in the thighs, in hot lands such as Al-Andalus in the land of Arabs and in the lands of India, which are hot and dry with little vegetation and where there is no grass or greenery.
And it is easily generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
And the formation of it is through putrefaction that occurs below the cord, similar to how venom from serpents and worms enters the body, and these creatures breed between the cord and the flesh.
And the sign of its appearance is when this vein in the thigh becomes inflamed with great heat, and then the area swells, and soon after that, a branch of the vein begins to emerge from the location of the swelling, resembling the root of a plant.
And so when the limb appears, then it is necessary to wrap around it a lead weight of two drachmas and attach it to the thigh with a bandage, leaving the lead suspended from the thigh.
And as many times as it extends to the sides for some reason, wrap that in lead and do not cut it. And if it becomes too long, then you should cut a part of it and wrap the remaining portion; but do not cut it from the root until it has emerged, because if you cut it there, it will retract and enter the flesh, causing abscess and inflammation in the location and bad ulceration.
Therefore it is necessary that it be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it has been completely removed from the body and there remains no part of it in the flesh.
And this vein extends to the length of two palms in some men, and I have heard that it has extended up to twenty palms in one case.
And if it is cut during treatment, then insert the blade into the opening of the wound and extend the incision through the flesh, continuing until all matter has been evacuated, and apply putrefaction to the area for several days using medications; and then treat the affected area with methods used for treating abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and it comes to it with many openings, and is extended from each opening as a branch.
And therefore treat it as we have said in the division and with what has been mentioned above.
Of the incision above worms generated under the skin and it is called cattle disease.
This disease is called in some lands "our cattle disease" because it often affects cows and is a worm that is born between the hide and the flesh, and moves through the body climbing up and down, and is revealed by sensation as it moves from one member to another until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just as happens with other worms and serpents and earthworms and roundworms in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it goes through the body and rises to the head, and reaches the brain, it easily corrupts it and enters, destroying the brain, and this happens frequently.
And so when you want to cure it and extract it, this cannot be done unless the movement and appearance of the worm at the sensation is followed, and then it is necessary to strengthen what is above it and loosen what is below it with pressure and constriction, and then dry and cauterize above it and extract the worm.
And if it is embedded in the flesh and you cannot find it, then you apply a hot cautery to the area where it is located until it dies, and the greatest fear is corruption of it which corrupts the location just as we have said.
But if you see it reach the head near the brain, then strengthen the eyebrow with strong constriction and dryness above it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient use purification of their body with evacuating medicines for corrupt and bad humors, and beware of foods generating putrefaction.
I'm not sure how to translate this sentence without more context, as it appears to be a fragment rather than a complete thought. "Nafor" could be a term for a particular medical condition or treatment, but I cannot find any reference to it in Latin or Romance languages. The word "sectione" suggests that the text is discussing some kind of surgical procedure, possibly related to treating an infection or wound. However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a definitive translation.
This disease is called "nafar" in our land and it is a pain that comes in certain members and frequently moves from one member to another.
I have already seen this according to what I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and when I examined her arm, I saw a small inflammation in the vein of her arm, and after an hour it began to move like a worm moving upwards, but more gently than if it were alive, like silver flowing from place to place.
And then the pain moved from that location and entered the muscle, and it stayed there for an hour.
And then it moved into the other body until it reached the other arm.
And I advise that you turn him over on his body according to how I saw it; and it was truly remarkable the transformation of him and the speed of one member compared to another. I had already seen before that in my heels according to that manner, but I have also seen many who find pain transferred from one member to another. But I did not see that in the heels as in the woman.
And I do not think it is anything but due to the fact that the woman was old, with dry flesh and exposed veins, and in this condition she experiences that sensation of transferred windiness.
And it is necessary that this reverse treatment does not appear in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with thin veins.
And as you wish to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then do not appear to press on his heel as we have said, but rather strengthen him and gently push down on it, releasing any trapped windiness within, and cauterize the area.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then cure him by inducing the body to vomit and releasing windiness, and use foul-smelling powders and Serapias-like pills and similar remedies.
Of arrow extraction.
Arrows are diverse according to their shapes and the locations in which they strike, for their diversity consists of those with large heads, small ones, concave ones, blunt ones, solid ones; and of those with three points, and those that have tongues; and those with feathers.
And the signs of death are when an arrow strikes him and passes through the bone and exits at the skullcap that is above the brain, causing sudden severe pain, blind spots in vision, dizziness, numbness in the heels, inflammation, and a swollen red tongue, spasms, confusion, vomiting of bile, quick loss of speech and destruction of voice, white fluid like dust coming out of the wound, and watery discharge resembling flesh.
Therefore, if these signs appear to you, then you must refrain from treating or extracting the arrow, unless it is necessary.
But the signs of an arrow when it strikes near the left nipple and seems to be stuck in a hard place and not easily movable; and soon the movement of the arrow resembles the pulse, and there is black blood flowing from the wound, and a chill in the limbs, cold sweats, and fainting; and so you should know that death is imminent.
And the signs when the arrow has struck the lung are foamy blood from the wound, swelling of the veins near the neck, a change in the patient's color, labored breathing and panting, and a desire for fresh air.
And if the arrow strikes the fascia, which is in the foot, and the pain is near the small ribs, and it causes great and severe pain and sighing, and not all members of the muscles are affected.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then soon there will be undigested food coming from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly and is stuck in it, then there will be a tear or rent in the wound, or the skin or intestine that has been torn apart, and there is no hope for cure through extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrowhead remains in the bladder, and urine comes out of it, and some cause makes it come out of the body, and a sharp pain is present near the patient, then you should know that it is mortal.
But other parts of the body, such as the face, neck, and collarbone, shoulders and arms, spine of the back, the fork of the ribs, the hip, and the leg, are spared according to the greatest dispositions when the arrow does not hit a vein or artery, and is not venomous.
And I recommend to you what I have seen about the nature of these arrows, so that you understand by this about the easy cure.
The reason for this is that an arrow hit the lacrimal gland in the eye of a man on the ridge of his nose, and I extracted it from the other side, leaving the cartilage of his ear behind, and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a judge, which hit him in the grays of his eye, leaving the eyelid and the arrowhead was hidden and not discovered except for a small extremity with which it adhered to its shaft, and it was a large arrow of sharp Turkish arrows, with a lion's iron without ears.
And the judge is Senator, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man, which had fallen in his throat, and was an Arabic arrow with ears, and then I inserted my finger between two sutures and it was submerged in the man's throat, and so I loosened it with that and carefully extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man who had fallen in his belly, and I thought he would die from that; but as thirty days passed and there was no change in his condition, I inserted my finger on the arrow and moved it around, and the man was healed, and no harm came to him.
And I saw a man in whom an arrow hit his back, and the wound was closed, but after seven years, the arrow came out through the ridge of his hip.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow hit her belly, and the wound was closed inside her, and there was no change in her condition for a long time, and the woman suffered no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow hit his face and the wound was closed, and the arrow had broken off, causing no significant pain, and many similar to this.
And I extracted the arrow from the man of the king's chief who had fallen in the middle of his nose and had slightly declined to the right, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called for the treatment of this man within three days after the arrow piercing.
And then I examined the wound from the arrow and found it to be very narrow, so I gently probed with my finger but did not feel anything; but the man felt a prick below his right ear, and so I suspected that this prick was due to the extremity of the arrow.
And I applied a plaster with attractive and digestive properties to the area, trusting that the wound would suppurate and reveal the location of the arrow so that it could be dried up.
And no significant harm came to the area where the arrow had struck, and I continued applying the plaster for several days without incident; the wound healed in the meantime, and the man felt the arrow inside his nose after many days, and told me about it. [*] E adonc yeu recomtare a lu que se esgratelles le nas e la sageta cayga defora, lo qual feyt aquel e la sageta caygu defora per la raysa de la porta del huel; e adonc jeus l'aurelha e la sageta entera a lu.
And then I applied a sharp and corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened up, and with my finger, I gently felt around and found the subtle extremity of the arrow still attached to the shaft.
And then I continued to apply the sharp medicine until the opening of the wound was visible and the tip of the arrow appeared clearly to me, and this process took me about four months.
And as the wound became larger and it was possible for me to insert forceps, I removed them, but they did not help, so I continued to work on it with subtlety and ingenuity in various ways until one day, using a well-made forceps, I managed to take hold of it and extract it; and then I restored the wound.
And some doctors thought that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored, but I managed to restore it and heal the wound completely, and the patient was healed without any after-effects in any way.
And I tell you about the quality of extracting some arrows so that you can understand by this rule and meaning what I have not said, for the methods of this art and definitions of it are not understood through narrative or found in these books.
And wise craftsmen compare little with much, and what is present with what is absent, and must find new operations and instruments in accordance with the strange causes of the art when they occur.
And so I say that arrows are not expelled from the members in which they are embedded except by two means: either by attraction to the place where they enter, or by the opposite of the other side.
And that which is expelled from the place where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place and pulled out and expelled.
And if it does not obey the hour in which it entered, then you must leave it for several days until you can loosen the flesh around it and ease its exit due to the attraction of the place.
And similarly if it is embedded in bone and does not obey you at the hour of entry, then leave it alone for several days and stimulate it with attraction and motion every day until it has been expelled.
And if it does not obey you after several days, then you must bore around the arrow in the bone from all sides with a subtle awl until the area around the arrow is expanded and you can extract it.
But if the arrow is already hidden in the body and cannot be felt, then examine it with your finger and if you feel it, then pull it out using appropriate instruments for attraction.
But if you cannot reach the arrow because of the constriction of the wound and its depth, and there is no bone or nerve or vein in that area, then make an incision over the wound until it expands and becomes possible to extract the arrow.
But if the arrowhead is still attached to something holding it in place, then cut away all the flesh around it from all sides with all the skill and ingenuity you possess; and work on freeing the flesh from the arrowhead by breaking the attachment or twisting it until it comes loose.
And when you extract the arrow from any location, then use twisting motions with your hand holding forceps in all directions until it obeys; and work carefully so that the arrow is not broken and made difficult to extract, but rather removed easily and smoothly.
But if you cannot extract it at that time, then leave it alone for several days until the surrounding areas are better able to be manipulated; and try again later when it has become easier to move. But if extracting the arrow causes excessive bleeding, then treat it according to what I have already mentioned in its section.
And be careful when examining the arrow not to injure veins or nerves or tendons, and use all means possible to remove the arrow safely and calmly, taking your time and working with firmness as I have recommended.
And therefore, you should try to make the arrow conform to the shape it had when it entered the body so that the wound is as similar as possible to its original form, which will be more beneficial for the patient's recovery. But if that is not possible, then do what you can to reshape it as best as you can.
But if the arrow is expelled by the opposite side of its entry point, or if it has already begun to protrude from the body on its own, or if the extremity of the arrow becomes swollen and can be felt through the skin, then dry around that area and make an incision according to the size that will accommodate your forceps; and then extract it, for this type is easily pulled out. [*] E si la sageta es de fusta o d'os e passa entre duo nervi o vena, lahoras tu fen sobre aquel loc entro que sia amplificat e extraxi aquela per le spazi de temps entro quatre meses.
But if it is trapped in the bone, then twist the arrow against its direction of entry until it moves further into the bone and expands; and then extract it.
But if that does not work, leave it alone for several days and try again until it loosens.
And if the shaft of the arrow is still in there, then push it out with force.
But if the shaft is broken and you wish to push it out, then insert a concave instrument into the wound if it is deep enough, so that it fits around the back of the arrowhead; and then use that to push it out with force.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then push it out with a strong instrument inserted into the wound, for the arrow will be easier to extract in this way.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you should remove all the flesh around the wound and treat it with appropriate antidotes as necessary.
And if the arrow hits the foot or the belly or the bladder or the ribs and is close enough that you can touch it with your finger, and it is possible to dry around the wound, then do so while being careful not to injure veins or nerves; extract the arrow, clean and dress the wound, and treat it until it heals. [*] E si la sageta catz en le testa o en le col e passa entro al cervel, e apar a tu que le sieu esser sia equat, e yeu tenga alcus dias de vida, lahoras tu layssa aquela entro que·l sieu esser sia equat.
Here is a description of forceps for extracting arrows:
The ends of the forceps are shaped like bird's beaks and have serrated edges that grip onto the arrow when it is grasped, preventing it from slipping out of the instrument.
And there are many types of forceps made in various sizes, large, small and medium, depending on the size and thickness of the arrow, as well as the size of the wound and its constriction.
like a ray to alleviate the pain inside (the body) caused by the concave arrow and expelled with it:
On bloodletting from veins.
The veins that are commonly used for bloodletting are usually three: Of which there are sixteen in the head, of which there are two pulsating veins near the ears, called "auricularis anterior" and "posterior"; two veins that are apparent in the temples; two veins known as "lacrimal" located in the inner corner of each eye; a vein located in the middle of the forehead; and a vein in the tip of the nose; two veins on either side of the neck; two veins on the upper lip; two veins on the lower lip; and - these are called "angular" veins; and there are also two veins below the tongue. But only five veins are typically bled in the arms: The five veins that are typically bled in the arms include:
And in the foot and leg there are three main veins:
The benefits of bloodletting from the veins near the ears include treatment for chronic headaches, migraines, epilepsy, and old ulcers on the scalp.
The recommended method for bloodletting from the veins near the ears is as follows:
Then take the scalpel-like lancet, which is sharp and pointed, and insert it just below the vein in the crease of the elbow until the bloodletting instrument reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the vein and elbow upward towards the upper part of the body, and make an incision into the vein using a sharp cut. And let the length of the incision be about the width of two fingers or thereabouts, and allow as much blood to flow out as desired.
Then apply pressure with your fingertips and leave it in place until the wound is healed.
And at the beginning of this book, I have already discussed the incision and cauterization of these (veins).
But the benefits of bloodletting from the two arteries in the temples are for chronic migraines, persistent headaches, eye diseases, and acute swelling in the limbs.
The recommended method for bloodletting from the temporal arteries is as follows:
Then raise the arm above the vein with your indicated hand, insert the sharp bloodletting instrument just below the vein and elevate it, making an incision in the same way as you did for the other two veins; and allow blood to flow according to the amount needed.
Then loosen any tightness or constriction in the patient's limb, place your finger over the incision site for one hour to apply pressure and prevent further bleeding, and then apply a bandage or dressing with firm pressure to promote healing and help close the wound.
And the discussion of their incisions and cauterization has already been provided at the beginning of this book.
And so the benefits of bloodletting from the frontal vein are similar to those of bloodletting from the cephalic vein in treating chronic facial conditions, migraines, inflammation, and fetid ulcers.
The recommended method for bloodletting from the frontal vein is as follows: have the patient tighten their neck with a bandage to make the vein visible, and then use a sharp instrument called a fossor with the following shape:
Place the pointed end of the fossor on top of the vein and strike it with a blunt object, such as a mallet or your other hand, causing blood to flow according to the desired amount; then remove the instrument from the incision site and loosen any tightness or constriction in the patient's neck, applying pressure to the area with a sterile dressing or gauze pad until hemostasis is achieved.
And sometimes a space is opened with a lateral bloodletting incision, but it is not necessary for the bloodletting instrument to have an acute tip like other bloodletting instruments; instead, it should be blunt and transverse, as the bone is close and easily broken by a sharp instrument.
But the benefits of bloodletting from the two veins located near the inner corners of both eyes include treatment for scabies on the hands, inflammation, and foot conditions; as well as facial disorders.
The recommended method for bloodletting from the lacrimal veins involves having the patient tighten their neck with a bandage to make the veins visible, and then performing the procedure while standing over the patient's head.
And make the incision for the phlebotomy following the direction of the transverse to longitude a little with the phlebotomy lancet a little, because in that area there is no flesh; and if the phlebotomy is fine, then the tip of it will be easily broken.
And let the blood flow as much as is necessary for you, and then place a compress on that area, strengthen it for one night, and then loosen it.
But the phlebotomy of the nasal vein is effective for acute fever and violent headaches, and for diseases of the face and migraines and gout that occurs in the face, especially when it is old.
And the method of phlebotomy is that the patient should bend their neck and turn their head towards you with your left hand, and take a fine lancet and place it in the middle of the root of the nose following the straight line, because the vein does not feel here, and because blood starts to flow immediately.
It is necessary that you slowly move your hand with the lancet and let the blood flow according to your needs; and then bind it for one night, because it heals easily.
But the benefit of phlebotomy on both sides is that it helps with constriction of the arteries and the beginning of leprosy and many other diseases, impetigo, and corrosive ulcers such as herpetiform.
And the method of phlebotomy on both sides is that the patient should bend their neck down and lie on their side, while the operator stands over their head;
And then make an incision in the vein with a wide but shallow lancet slowly; and remove the blood according to a moderate quantity or as much as is necessary at that time; and then proceed similarly with the other vein.
And then loosen the ligature and bind both veins with mild pressure so that the patient is not overly weakened, and leave it overnight because the wound will be healed by morning.
And the benefit of phlebotomy on the veins in the temples is that it helps with small abscesses and pustules in the mouth, corruption of gums, and bad ulcers and fissures, and with ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the method of phlebotomy on those veins is that you make the patient sit in front of you, and bind their neck with a bandage, and then turn their lips and look for two veins, one on each side of the lip; and identify them by the darkness of both, especially around those small black veins; and then make an incision in each one with an incision.
But if you are in doubt, and do not know which one to choose, then identify the larger of those two, and the one that is most swollen among them.
And proceed similarly with the two veins that are in the upper lip.
But the benefit of phlebotomy on the two veins that are under the tongue is especially for swellings that occur in the throat, for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the method of phlebotomy on those veins is that you make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun, and raise their tongue, and look under their tongue for two veins, one from one side and the other from the other side, and the color of each one tends to be darker.
And then incise each of them; and make sure not to press too hard when phlebotomizing those, because there are arteries underneath.
And the veins that are commonly phlebotomized in the cold are those that are found in all men, and phlebotomy on them is done in two ways, either by applying myrtle or olive with fine precision; or drying with a scalpel, which is called electuary, and this is its form:
Let the myrtle leaf be as wide as it needs to be, and it is suitable for opening concave veins that appear to be thick and full of thick blood.
And this phlebotomy is of smaller width and has a finer tip, and it is suitable for incising fine veins that contain thin yellow blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy on the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it helps with removing blood from diseases that occur in the throat and neck, and with drying the chest and stomach.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist, when performing phlebotomy on that vein, to be careful and not be overly hasty, because there is an artery underneath; and if they make a mistake and puncture the artery instead of the vein during the incision, then they will cut it and cause bleeding, which is why it is necessary not to perform phlebotomy with a sharp lancet, but rather with electuary beforehand.
And if the basilic vein is not visible or apparent, then it is necessary to move on to the other one, or to look for a branch of it; or to perform phlebotomy in the area at the end of the arm, because that is visible; and dry it with electuary as previously mentioned.
But if you want to perform phlebotomy on the median vein, then it is necessary before the bend of the arm to touch the area between where you can feel the pulse, and then place your hand there with a bandage; and bind the arm and dry the vein with a concave incision using electuary as previously mentioned; and make sure that the percussion does not affect the area near the artery.
And when you see that as you tighten the ligature, there is swelling in the area that you marked with a bandage, then that swelling is due to the artery; and therefore, avoid it.
And if you see that blood is flowing from the incision like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then you should know that it is arterial blood; and in this case, you should press down on the area with your finger for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the bleeding has stopped, because often it will have stopped, then you should strengthen the arm and leave it alone.
And take care of the patient from any mucus they may have, and be cautious around them and do not harm them for several days until they are healed.
But if the bleeding has not stopped and you do not have any medicine to address it, then you should cut the artery if it is visible, because its tip will contract and the blood will stop flowing; or you can take a piece of leather, make a hole in it, and place a wick inside; and then take a piece of raw meat and strengthen it over the area of the vein with gentle pressure using a ligature and some powder within one day.
And if the bleeding has stopped, then that is good; but if it has not, then you should treat it with what was mentioned previously in the section on powders for stopping the flow of blood.
And stopping the flow of blood from an incision is difficult in many cases due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of swelling in the arm.
But phlebotomy on the fusca vein is beneficial for removing blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it consists of branches of the basilic and cephalic veins, as previously mentioned.
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be very careful when performing phlebotomy on that vein, because there is a nerve underneath; and if they puncture the nerve instead of the vein during the incision, then it will cause numbness, and healing will be difficult and often incomplete. And this nerve is often sensitive to touch; but if it is hidden and subtle and not visible, then it is necessary to stop the phlebotomy and use electuary as previously mentioned, and avoid the nerve with all your strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should puncture the vein along its length.
The benefit of making an incision in the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and relieves illnesses of the hands.
And it is appropriate in this case, if you want the incisions to be made with an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped fleam, because it is safest for all veins, as it does not damage the artery or nerves.
However, it is often easy for some men to develop an abscess if they are not incised in the first percussion, but you will not notice this abscess at all.
The first point is that you should know that incisions are not administered for any other reason but to maintain health and with hope and caution against the onset of illnesses. And it should be done by making an incision in one of the veins in the crook of the arm, namely: cephalic, basilic or median cubital; and incisions should be made at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in early spring and autumn, and during winter close to meal times when signs of engorgement appear.
And incisions should be made every third day, or at the earliest after three hours have passed since dawn.
However, incisions should be administered not only when it is convenient and necessary, but also at night or during the day, at any hour and in all seasons.
It is advisable that children under the age of 14 are not incised and pregnant women should not be incised between the fourth and seventh month, and old people who have already passed 60 years of age should not be incised either.
And if someone wants to be incised in any way, it is advisable that they cleanse their bowels with a lion's claw enema before the incision, especially if there is a retained fissure in them, so that the veins do not push out the superfluidities during the incision of the bowels, which are purified and do not pollute the main members.
And patients with sacred nausea or hangovers should not be incised until their condition has subsided, nor should those suffering from dropsy or drunkenness, and incision is to be avoided in cases of colic or vomiting, or abdominal pain, or excessive production of urine or exertion, or fasting, vigils, and all causes that weaken the vitality, whether corporeal or animal.
And also consider the refinement of humors beforehand if the blood is thick, with food and drink, and with medications if it is possible for you to do so.
And also take a bath if there is no reason preventing it, or engage in physical exercise to refine the blood.
And postpone the incision until the afternoon, around the hour of terce, as we have said.
And make sure that the area of the incision is protected from all harmful animals in that day, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily harm, such as excessive effort, pain, urination, and similar symptoms.
And at the time of the incision, let there be present causes that are commonly used by humans with aromatics and fragrances, balms, and similar items according to their availability.
And let the incisor sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the person being incised.
And then extend your arm and have the incisor wipe it with their hand two or three times, and then tighten the ligament with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the tightening be moderate, because if it is too tight or too loose, it will prevent the flow of blood or cause the blood to spill out.
And when tightening the ligament, it is advisable that the person being incised rubs their hands together between them until the veins become engorged and are noticeable to the touch.
And let the incisor anoint their incising tool with a little antique oil specifically; and then place your left index finger on that vein, below the location where you want to make the incision, so that the vein moves slightly away and the percussion is more accurate. Like this, you can find which of the veins it is by its reaction to the fleam, and if it is filled with air, it will contract when you place the fleam on it. The incisor must then make sure that they open the vein properly, and if they do not, the opening will be too small.
And so, it is important that the incisor remains steady and focused on all these factors.
And then let the incisor stop making the incision, but if the vein is found in a side branch, that's good; otherwise, try again a little further down or above that location, unless the area is infected.
And if the area is infected or the patient feels faint, you should wait a day or two and not tighten the ligament too much because it may cause an abscess to form or make the person feel worse, nor should they bathe during this time.
And then let the incisor repeat the incision if necessary.
And if the incision is small and only a little blood flows weakly, and you fear that not enough blood will flow, then you should make another incision in that same location according to necessity and accuracy, but be quick about it before the area becomes infected because some men are prone to infection even with a minor incision.
But if the area is already infected, then you should not make another incision there because it will not help, and instead apply some oil to a different location on the wound to soothe the body's reaction to the blood. And in this case, oil is better than other substances.
Similarly, apply a wound of oil in every incision made on the veins to prevent an excessive reaction from the body, and use theriac of Galen and sage when one of those is applied to the location after making the incision, because it refines thick blood and calms the body. [To be continued]
And if a large abscess forms at the site of incision, which often happens to those who are not accustomed to bloodletting or when the incision is made in only one vein or near a vein, then you should stop and apply a sponge soaked in warm salt water on the area for an hour, because this will help dissolve it. [To be continued]
It is essential that the incisor does this at the moment of blood flow from that vein, or another vein.
And if there is some blackness or greenness remaining in the area for several days, do not be concerned; but if you wish, apply a poultice of aloe and myrrh dissolved in it, or a poultice of crushed mint leaves or chamomile, or similar substances. [To be continued]
And often many abscesses and swellings occur that require bloodletting of the basilic vein.
And so if you find softness in that area with your compression, then this swelling is harmful and bad; be careful to apply a remedy that we mentioned earlier because blood may flow from an artery.
And apply a styptic poultice to strengthen the area and continue treating it with other remedies until it heals completely.
And it is necessary to extract the correct amount of blood from every person, according to their strength and the color of the blood as it appears.
Because if the blood is dark, you should let it flow until it turns red; similarly, if it appears thick, let it flow until it becomes thinner; and similarly, if it is watery, let it flow until its sharpness subsides.
And it is necessary for those who are overweight and need bloodletting in one location to widen the incision on the vein and make the incision larger.
And for those who are weak, do the opposite and extract blood in multiple locations with small incisions.
The most appropriate technique for venesection is to make a transverse cut, not a puncture wound.
This method of bloodletting is safer because it reduces the risk of excessive bleeding and nerve damage, and is more recommended and safe than bloodletting along the length or width of a vein.
And for those who are prone to fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary to cure them beforehand with a piece of bread soaked in millet wine or simple oxymel that has been warmed up; and extract only a small amount of blood in three or four stages.
And for those who are chilled in their complexion, they should take before bloodletting bread soaked in myrrh syrup or honey syrup infused with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and similar, or fragrant and aromatic syrup.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting due to the loss of a large amount of blood, it is necessary for them to drink water infused with meat and fragrant, subtle syrup; use aromatics such as aloe, and wrap their body with that fragrance.
And use other remedies mentioned in the chapter on fainting for evacuation.
Those who want to relieve their arms and dissolve the blood gradually should have bloodletting done in multiple stages, because they have weak constitution and cannot handle large amounts of blood loss at once; instead, it should be done progressively over several days according to their strength.
But those who want to relieve their arms and expel the blood for a second time, and have a strong constitution, should do this seven or nine hours after the first bloodletting.
But those who want to draw blood away from their body in the opposite direction of its natural flow should have it done on the second or third day after the initial bloodletting.
But if a person's body has too much congested blood and it is causing fever, then they should have all the excess blood removed in one session, with a large incision and enough to cause fainting; and the incisor must press their hand on the pulse of the patient to prevent death instead of fainting, because many ignorant and negligent incisors have caused this mistake. [To be continued]
And it is not advisable when you want to unbind the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, since the orifices of the vein are already closed and it has become difficult to expel the blood, that you press forcefully on that same area and bend and stretch it slightly, because that is very harmful.
Leave it so that a second venesection can be performed; or maintain the sharpness of the venesection that has coagulated blood in the vein's orifices; or place over it a plaster of treacle or of senna, and press lightly on it until the blood comes out.
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the inflammation has subsided.
And if necessity requires that you perform venesection again and it is not avoidable, then bleed the patient on the same spot or on the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "funis of the arm" is to be bled in place of the fuscina or basilica veins when they are not found or are hidden, because it consists of those.
The quality of the venesection is that the patient should place their hand in warm water until the lancet turns red and the vein becomes visible.
And then apply pressure lightly above the puncture site with a ligature to stop the bleeding; and perform the venesection crosswise in a small area, not laterally or along its length.
And make the incision wide and perform the venesection so that you cut into the vein slightly at its joint in the hand.
And if the flow of blood is not allowed, then immerse your hand in warm water and let the blood flow into it until you have satisfied your need.
But if you are in the summer months, then you are excused from immersing your hand in warm water, and in winter it is sufficient to immerse the body in warm water instead of the limb.
And the venesection of this vein is safer than that of all other veins, because there are no pulsating veins or nerves below it.
And the venesection of the small vein in the right hand is effective for illnesses of the liver.
The quality of the venesection is that you should tie off the limb tightly with a ligature or your hand after immersing it in warm water, until the vein becomes engorged and clearly visible; then make a transverse incision, and if it goes too deep it will not be harmful.
Be careful not to sever the nerves in your hand with the venesection, as they are often exposed and close to the surface of the skin.
And then immerse the hand in warm water and let the blood flow into it, because if you do not immerse it in warm water, the blood will coagulate in the vein's orifice and obstruct the flow of blood.
And once the required amount of blood has been extracted, apply a mixture of oil and salt to the vein to prevent it from clotting and hardening; similarly, it is advisable to apply pressure tightly to all parts of the limb.
However, the benefit of venesection in the left hand is that it is effective for illnesses of the spleen.
And do similarly in the venesection as you have done with the other.
And the benefit of the saphenous vein in venesection is for illnesses that are located in the lower parts of the body, such as uterine or menstrual disorders, and respiratory diseases, as well as chronic ulcers and abscesses of the hips and thighs, and similar conditions.
The quality of the venesection is that the patient should place their foot in warm water and massage it until the veins become visible; then tie a band around the ankle to restrict blood flow, and make the incision at the point where the vein is most prominent and branches out into many smaller vessels on the surface of the foot.
And so make a wider incision below the knee, closer to the calf, as this is better and safer.
And if you are performing venesection on the surface of the foot, be careful not to cut the nerves that lie just beneath the skin there; instead, make a transverse incision as if you were going to cut into it, but without actually cutting through.
And venesections are to be done with care.
But if bloodletting is contraindicated, then immerse the patient's foot in warm water and allow the blood to flow into it until the desired amount has been released.
And if the lancet misses its mark on the first try during venesection, then try again with a slightly different angle or position, as the area is safe; but be careful not to accidentally cut any nerves, as we have previously discussed.
And do the same for the saphenous vein on the other foot as well.
And the location for venesection of the sciatic vein is as we have said, on the lower calf, towards the outside of the leg.
And the benefit of venesection of this area is for pain in the hip due to blood congestion.
The technique for venesection in this area is that the patient should enter a bath and tie a thin, long band around their calf above the ankle, pulling it tight so that only the vein is visible.
And so when the vein appears, then perform venesection as is appropriate for each individual case and make a transverse incision if possible, as this is better; or make an incision with a lancet or cut it with a scalpel, as the area is safe.
And in many men, the sciatic vein is quite small; if you cannot find it, then make an incision in one of its branches instead, which is located on the back of the foot near the base of the fourth and fifth toes.
And be careful to avoid cutting any nerves, and release the desired amount of blood through the incision.
And then release any tension and apply pressure to the site of the incision, holding it firmly but gently to promote healing.
And now we will discuss the topic of cupping and its various techniques.
Cupping can be performed using cups made from horns, glass, or animal organs such as the bladder or stomach.
Cupping can be performed in two ways: one method involves making small incisions in the skin and extracting blood, while the other method does not involve cutting the skin.
The cupping method that does not involve cutting the skin can also be performed in two ways: with or without heat.
And the cups that are administered with incisions and bloodletting can be applied to 14 locations on the body, of which the first is where the cups are placed, and this is at the nape of the neck; the second location is in the middle of the back, between the two shoulder blades; the third location is below the jaw, just below the mouth; the fourth location is on both sides of the spine, using a flat surface; the fifth location is on the liver, above the hip bone; the sixth location is on both sides of the lower back, at the level of the kidneys; the seventh location is on both ankles; and the eighth location is on both thighs.
Suction should only extract blood from the small veins spread in the flesh, and not diminish its strength as it does through bloodletting; nor is it necessary for suction to be done with or without fire in any disease caused by repletion until the whole body has been evacuated.
But if necessity requires suction for illness or continued use, administer it at the beginning and end of each month, in the middle of the lunar phase and at some other times.
Therefore, when you see any of those causes, especially in the third or middle phase of the month, then order suction to be performed more than two or three hours after sunrise.
The benefit of suction on the neck is that when it relieves heaviness in the head and swelling in the eyes, but it is necessary for this to be accompanied by evacuation of the whole body.
And this suction should be performed on the vein used for bloodletting in the head.
And it is not permitted to use suction on those with a cold complexion or those who have a catarrh, as this can cause great harm.
And for that reason, it is not necessary to use suction on the elderly and those who have severe illnesses in their heads.
But if the suction is performed continuously on one person, it can cause forgetfulness; and for that reason, you must order the practitioner to lift their hand slightly from time to time, in order to prevent the generation of forgetfulness.
But suction on the throat is performed in the vein used for bloodletting of the basilic vein and the vena fusca, and this can relieve asthma, constriction of the windpipe, cough, and repletion.
And it is necessary to move the suction cup slightly on the throat, as if it is left in one place for too long, it can cause weakness in the body and stomach.
Suction applied to the temples can relieve headaches and eye pain, migraines, and inflammation, as well as toothache; and this is performed on the vein used for bloodletting in the basilic vein.
And you must order the practitioner not to press their hand too hard during suction, as this can cause the artery to be cut and result in excessive bleeding.
Suction applied below the chin can relieve bad breath in the mouth, gum disease, and other similar ailments of the mouth; and this is performed on the vein used for bloodletting in the ala nasi veins, which are located on the two lips.
But suction applied with two metal cups can relieve headaches caused by an excess of heat in the body.
Suction applied to the inner parts of the eyes can relieve symptoms similar to bloodletting from three veins, which are the basilic, vena fusca, and cephalica veins; as this type of suction draws blood from all those small veins that are present in the flesh, and allows for the evacuation of blood from smaller veins into larger ones.
And order the practitioner not to make deep incisions during suction, as the area is devoid of flesh and only has nerves and arteries underneath.
And suction applied to the buttocks can relieve hemorrhoids and ulcers located in that area.
And you must order the practitioner to use a large suction cup made of iron, as the area requires strong suction; and they should avoid using weak and fine suction cups that require incisions for bloodletting.
But suction cups applied to the flanks can relieve various chronic pains, such as those in the ribs and abdomen, and in the bladder; they can also promote menstruation and relieve bloating and pain; and this is performed on the veins used for bloodletting in the saphenous veins and the jugular vein.
However, suction cups can weaken the entire body and cause fainting in some people.
And the benefit of suction cups applied to the jugular vein is similar to that of suction cups applied to the flanks.
And the proper way to use suction cups is to place them initially upside down and then apply gentle suction; do not keep them in one position for too long, but instead move them slightly and allow the fluids to come to the surface naturally. And do not stop repeating this process until you see that the area has become red, swollen, and hot to the touch, indicating that blood has begun to flow.
And then make small incisions and continue to suction gently while taking into account the patient's overall condition.
Because in those with thin and fragile skin, it is necessary to make only one incision and not more, in order to prevent the area from becoming ulcerated.
And order the practitioner to make wide incisions that are not too deep and to apply suction gently.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make two incisions; as in the first incision, the pathway for the suction of the blood and its watery components will be opened up. But in the second incision, the focus should be on achieving the careful extraction of thicker blood.
And if the blood is very viscous or thick, then it may be necessary to make a third incision in order to completely extract all of the impurities.
Finally, if only a small amount of blood needs to be extracted, then making just one incision should suffice.
If the goal is to extract a large amount of blood, then make multiple incisions; and if you know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make deep incisions.
The depth of the incision should be no more than the width of a finger.
And if the patient has thick and hard skin with small pores, then it is necessary to use a milder and more resolving oil in order to create an effective seal for suction cups; in summertime, this may include aloe oil or lavender oil, while in wintertime, one may use narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or blood-based oils.
If the skin is thick and rough, then use a stronger oil such as wormwood oil, costmary oil, aloe oil, or anise oil to create a strong seal for suction cups.
However, if the practitioner has wide pores and tender skin, then they should avoid using oil and instead use water or a mild solution to clean the suction cups before applying them. This may include rosewater, cold water from the sun, or water infused with comfrey or wormwood.
If the patient's blood is very watery, then clean the suction cups with vinegar or a solution made from myrtle and sumac before applying them.
If the patient's skin is thick and rough, then clean the suction cups with vinegar or a solution made from wormwood, marjoram, dill, chamomile, or similar herbs before applying them.
It is important to avoid bathing immediately before suction therapy and instead wait for at least an hour after bathing; furthermore, it is recommended that the patient rest and sleep with the suction cups in place.
What must be done before suction therapy or bloodletting is to avoid bathing immediately beforehand, and instead wait for at least an hour after bathing; it is also recommended that the patient rest and sleep with the suction cups in place.
It is important to consider the temperament of both the practitioner and the patient before beginning suction therapy or bloodletting; if the practitioner has a choleric temperament and tends to cause excessive bleeding and inflammation, then it may be beneficial to use cooling and astringent herbs such as acetosa, endive with vinegar, lettuce, scabious, and similar remedies.
And stop their foods as allowed, and bird meats, and foods seasoned with sourness, and similar things to them.
And for those who have a cold complexion, it is appropriate to give them to drink theriac ale-yellow or theriac alescabene of seeds, and sumac, and a moderately fragrant wine between vinegar and new; and let it be recommended to them to use little drinking and eating, and avoid foods such as beef, mutton, pork, small birds, and doves.
And it is appropriate that on the day of bloodletting and phlebotomy, their drink intake should be greater than their food.
And it is appropriate to give certain men theriac, or pharmaceuticals made from musk, such as muscade or alcelita before bloodletting or phlebotomy, so that the main members are comforted and the blood is refined; and they should not take those scalefty things.
But let the bloodlettings that are incisions be bloodlettings that are placed on the liver, and above the spleen and gout, and above the navel, in the places of the joints, and the bladder of the hip, because these members do not tolerate incisions on themselves.
And it is not desired for those (people) but rather the attraction of blood from a member, such as placing a bloodletting incision on the breast in illness of bleeding from the nose; and they use that which dissolves cold viscous wind in the member, such as placing it on the stomach and navel; because that rarefies the member and makes it supple, and lessens pain by resolving wind.
And it is placed on boils when they occur in their opening or growth, because by virtue of strong attraction it easily draws out the pus and eradicates the growth from its place.
And similarly it is done when it is placed on the liver and spleen in cases of trapped wind.
And these bloodlettings are administered with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of thick water in illnesses of the spleen.
And that is why the bloodletting incision is filled and becomes larger, that is to say with hot water alone or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
Method of bloodletting administered with fire: let the width of the orifice be two fingers, as we have made it; and let the quantity of the pressure be the size of a palm; and let it be in its place, in the area that is in the circuit, the size of it, the hole should be small according to the quantity that enters it, the size of a needle.
Let it be made of iron or citrus wood, with thick edges, lion-like, sharp and smooth so that it does not harm the member in its position on it.
And let there be in its middle a transverse bar of iron or of fire, where the candle with the fire is placed.
And let this bloodletting be greater than the one that we have recommended; and smaller than that according to the illnesses and the state of the person who uses it.
And the bloodlettings for infants and weak individuals are different from those for young and robust people.
And the quality of placing this bloodletting with fire on the member is that it extends the wick with decent firewood before a small candle of wax, and places it in the middle of the transverse bar in the middle place of the bloodletting, so that the fire is lit around the edge so that it does not burn the body of the patient.
And then it should be placed on the member of the patient, and the finger should be on the hole that we have said, until when we have the bloodlettings and do not need to press the finger and the vapor rises over that hole, then the bloodletting will be dissolved immediately.
And properly with fire, as is its manner, and light that if you need it.
But in bloodletting that is administered in the illness of plague, with water, in which there is no transverse bar nor hole, and it is not administered except that it be filled with water, and it is placed on the member only.
And this is the form of it: And this bloodletting, the larger it is, the better it is, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Bloodsuckers are not administered on many members but rather on the members where it is not possible to place bloodletting incisions due to their small size, such as the mouth and gums and similar parts; or on denuded members without flesh, such as the nose and its like.
And the quality of using those that, if you have found bloodsuckers in clean waters of mud,
And then they should be left in clean water day and night until they are hungry, and that there is no cause remaining in the belly of those; and then let the body be evacuated at the beginning with bloodletting and with bloodlettings; and then let the member of the patient be rubbed until it reddens; and then let them be placed on it.
And when they are full and swollen.
And if it is possible to apply suction to the area with a bloodletting instrument, it is better in assistance.
And if not, then wash the place with sour wine and then with much water; and let it be rubbed and pressed out.
And if the flesh of the blood is prolonged at the time of the removal of the bloodsuckers, and it oozes, then you dip a cloth in cold water and place that on top so that the oozing is covered.
And if the blood is multiplied, then sprinkle on it vitriol trissat powder, or chalk and similar things of stiptic causes, until the blood is dried; or let the largest beans be placed on the place, cooked and roasted, and let them be left until the beans stick to the place, and the blood is dried.
And it is necessary, if it is necessary, iteration of bloodsuckers, when it is possible to change those.
And if the bloodsuckers are prohibited from suspension, then let the place be rubbed with fresh blood or place a needle in the places until blood flows; and then let them be placed, because those when they feel any blood immediately run away.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle on those a little bit of aloe trissat powder, or salt, or ash, and it falls off immediately.
Thus begins the procedure of the third section: restoration. This chapter is extremely necessary in the art of medicine; it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of bones.
Oh, son, know that foolish doctors and the uneducated boast of this chapter, those who never looked at the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter from them.[$ENDING\_LINE$$
And this is why this knowledge is hidden in our land; and I have never forgotten it at any time, nor relied on anything but my long study of the books of the Ancients, until I extracted the science from them through understanding their meaning.
And I continued to conduct experiments and studies throughout my life.
I have described in this chapter all that my science contains and what I have experimented with; as I have condensed it here for you and relieved myself from the burden of lengthy explanations. I have further condensed it in a summary, demonstrated it in an exemplary manner, and provided various forms of instruments used in these procedures. This is done as an addition to explanation, as I have done in two preceding chapters.
Chapter One.
Here is the translation of the second text: Therefore, it is fitting to mention in the prologue of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters at the beginning of which the craftsmen are focused on understanding their truth – so it is for you and those who are eager to learn or master this noble art from you.
Therefore, I say that when a fracture or dislocation, twist, or sprain occurs, it is necessary to start with bloodletting or cauterizing the area, or both, unless there is any reason preventing it, such as debilitation of strength, if the affected person is an infant, very old and decrepit, during intense heat, or extreme cold.
And let them eat light food such as herbs and the meat of birds and crustaceans; and forbid heavy meats and filling oneself with rich foods or any type of food that fills the veins with blood, until there is no risk of abscess formation, unless you do not fear an effusion of matter in the limb.
And then return the patient to their original lifestyle, which is customary for them.
Therefore, when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary that the patient be fed nutritious foods that are viscous and heavy, such as those made from wheat cooked with water, rice, beans, peas, cow's udders, poultry, fresh fish, thick wine, and similar foods. With this diet, the consolidation of the fracture occurs more easily and better.
And know that broken bones in men who are very young or old and weak cannot naturally heal and consolidate due to the dryness of their members.
However, nature arranges and stimulates the broken bone to grow together due to some similar cause like glue that thickens and strengthens it until they are conglutinated and united together, until they reach the end of strength and firmness, just as fire does at the beginning, until any cause prevents it from performing its functions.
And for this reason, it is necessary to avoid feeding the patient heavy and viscous foods, as mentioned earlier.
And know that the types of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of body parts, for a fracture of the bone in the leg is different from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the bone in the arm is different from a fracture in the spine. Similarly, all other body parts have their own distinct types of fractures.
And I will proceed with a recap of every type of fracture, explained in its separate chapter and distinct from the others.
Here is a recap of the different types of fractures within themselves. The types of fractures in bones are various in themselves, for there is such thing as an arched fracture that happens along its length, and some fractures occur based on the length of the bone. Additionally, there are also star-shaped, splintered, and unplanned fractures, similar to when a pen is prepared to write, and it creates a puncture wound with tearing in the skull, and there is also a small fissure fracture.
And each type of fracture has its own specific pain or torment in the healing process, which will be discussed further in their respective sections.
Here are some signs of bone fracture: And through this a broken bone is recognized: it is the deformity of it, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and only when you press on it with your hand.
And therefore when there is no visible deformity in the area, nor any palpable protrusion, and when you touch the bone with movement and the patient does not experience significant pain, then it is not a fracture.
However, it is possible that there may be a deformity or small fissure, so you should not manipulate it with your hand and apply pressure at this time. Rather, wait for a moment, considering which medicine to use based on the situation, and then gently apply it to the affected area.[translated by Bing]
And know that when the area is curved and not split in two or otherwise affected by some other issue such as complete rupture, then you should begin at once to correct it, taking care not to cause abscess with excessive cautery.
And if abscess results from the cautery, then leave it alone for several days until the abscess subsides; and afterwards treat it in any way possible with light dressings and bandages to reduce swelling.[translated by Bing]
And know that the restoration and healing of soft tissue is easier than that of bones where a break has occurred.
And strengthen it as appropriate based on your recollection and knowledge of the situation.
However, if the bone is broken, then it is necessary to extend the fractured limb by pulling it apart in two pieces, whether it be an arm or a leg; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two ropes or one rope and your hand. [translated by Bing]
And ensure that your position when setting the limb is in line with its natural shape, while the parts of the fractured limb are extended, then make sure to gently manipulate those additional pieces back into their proper places as best you can. [translated by Bing]
And be careful to not cause further harm or injury to the patient through your operation, and strive to align bones with their respective counterparts in the best possible way according to your abilities. [translated by Bing]
And it is important that you skillfully touch the affected area with your hand during this time, and if you notice any other issue, correct it and apply treatment according to the extent of your abilities. [translated by Bing]
And avoid violent extension and compression, as many foolish doctors often cause abscess through their operations due to excessive cautery or cause muscle contractions in the limb, as we have seen in their numerous cases.
And the quality of immobilization for the injured limb should be as follows: know that broken limbs are diverse in their smallness, largeness, and shape.
And for small limbs such as the arm, hand, or finger, it is recommended to use a wrapping of fine fabric. [translated by Bing]
However, for larger limbs such as the thigh or leg, a harder and more rigid wrapping is recommended, as the firm binding strengthens and supports the entirety of the large member with tight compression, preventing any damage from entering within. [translated by Bing]
And now, begin by applying a suitable amount of bandaging over the site of the fracture with three or four layers as needed for the affected limb, while gently holding the wrapping material in place with your hand. [translated by Bing]
And then come to the upper side of the site of the fracture, and hold it with less tension than you used to secure the fractured area. And then extend the wrapping slightly beyond the site of the fracture, gradually loosening the tension until you have covered and protected a large portion of the affected area. [translated by Bing]
And then take another bandage and wrap it around the other side of the fractured limb, extending the protection to cover and secure the area beyond the broken bone; continue with this process while adjusting the tension of each new layer as previously described. [translated by Bing]
And then place between the layers of wrapping a soft material like lamb's wool or fabric that has been smoothed out to match the contours of the broken bone, if it is deformed; otherwise, do not include any additional materials within the bandages. [translated by Bing]
And then place another bandage on top, and gently wrap it around the previous layers with appropriate tension, unless there is swelling or abscess in the area; if this is the case, leave it alone for several days, but then apply additional bandages with greater compression as needed. [translated by Bing]
And let the splints be made of cane, carefully crafted and formed with skill, or from pine wood or palm branches; their width should match the shape and form of the affected limb. [translated by Bing]
However, the splint that is placed over the site of the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the others, with a length appropriate to the size of the affected limb; then secure it in place with another bandage using your initial compression setting, followed by wrapping a belt or strap around it with appropriate tension, making sure that the compression is tighter near the site of the fracture and less so as it moves away from the injury. [translated by Bing]
And it is important that the threads or strings used to tie and secure the bandages are of medium thickness and fine quality, made from linen; using thicker strings or cords can cause uneven compression and lead to errors in healing. [translated by Bing]
Additionally, thin threads are not suitable as they will not provide sufficient compression, and there should be no more than a finger's width of space between each splint.
And if the patient complains of pain in the areas around the splint due to compression, then place a soft padding such as wool or red cloth underneath it to prevent injury.
Some types of fractures are caused by infection and result in disruption of the tendon, requiring special attention and treatment as described in the following chapter on unique cases.
And know that not all broken limbs can be immediately secured with splints on the first day; this is because larger limbs should not have splints applied for several days or a week or more, depending on the risk of abscess from cauterization.
This is the method for applying plasters as used by ancient medical practitioners to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains. [translated by Bing]
Here is a common method for applying a plaster for fracture healing, suitable for many different injuries and particularly effective for women and children, as it does not generate heat or friction: take some powdered flour from the mill, specifically the fine particles that accumulate along the walls of the grinding machine. [translated by Bing]
And then sift the flour through a sieve or strainer with egg white, and apply it as a thin yet not too fine layer, and use this mixture. [translated by Bing]
Another way to make an ointment that heals fractures, dislocations, and twists: take assafoetida, ladanum, acacia, enula (wild marjoram), migrach (milk thistle seed), each one drachma; myrrh and aloe each one drachma and twenty; all should be crushed and sifted and mixed with either alcoholic water or egg white if the patient's constitution is dry. Then apply this ointment, which is well composed and heals broken bones easily and benefits many people.
Another way to make an ointment that aids in fractures and sprains: combine milk thistle, white mallow one drachma; myrrh and aloe each one drachma; acacia six drachmas, and Armenian bole twenty drachmas.
All of these should be ground together in a mortar with pestle, then sieved and mixed with water or egg white and administered.
Another way of making an emplaster for joints and bones that have become separated from their proper place, as well as for treating pain and swelling in those areas and for treating fractures: take clean wool and soak it in vinegar, olive oil, and cook it, then place it on the affected area.
But in this plaster there is not the power of restoration, but rather the ability to draw out pus and expel pain directly.
Another way of making a plaster that can heal broken bones: take leaves from the wild poppy and from the fig tree, grind them all together and make a plaster from it.
Another abbreviated method of making a plaster that is used for healing fractures and promoting resolution of the remnants of pus-filled swellings: take equal parts of mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and barley flour. grind all the ingredients together and mix them with vinegar, as long as the affected part is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then use that [plaster] mixed with water from the boiled coltsfoot or simply with water and apply it as needed.
Another way of making a stronger plaster for resolving pus-filled swellings when there is hardened tissue that needs to be healed: take equal parts of mallow root, flax seeds, balsamite, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile and grind them together. Then mix this with the water of a freshly cut pine branch or simply with water or vinegar, depending on the condition of the member and its complexion.
But Hippocrates does not say in his book that a plaster should be placed on the broken member for its healing, but rather recommends using a wax made of beeswax and oil and nothing else; he also advises that it should be neither too thick nor too thin.
But in Galen's book it is seen that plasters are placed on the broken member for its healing and the causes of this treatment include those that produce drying with a little heat, such as myrrh, resins, and similar substances to those that we have recommended.
Another way of making a plaster that is suitable for treating injuries and pain: take equal parts of myrtle leaves, human hair that has been shaved or bird feathers, mallow root, and salt. Grind these ingredients together, sift them, and make a plaster from the mixture.
But the amount of time that the plaster should remain in place and then be removed depends on whether pain or swelling occurs or if the bone is fractured and out of its proper position. In this case, you should not loosen it for several days. And if there is strong pain or swelling in the area, then you should consider removing it immediately and taking off the plaster from that location.
And take a piece of linen and a wet marine sponge, and soak them in warm water. Then use these to gently wash the affected area until the swelling decreases and the pain is relieved. After that, allow the member to rest for an hour. Then place a clean wool cloth soaked in vinegar, oil or rose oil on it and bind it with a bandage overnight, or until you are certain that pus will not form and that inflammation of the member has subsided, and that the pain has been alleviated.
And then repeat that gentle massage and apply a light plaster, but do not bind it too tightly with your initial bandage. Instead, gradually loosen it as the injury heals.
And if you see that the pus, redness, pain, inflammation and all other symptoms have completely disappeared, and there is no longer a need for plasters or bandages, then repeat the process as you did at the beginning in equal measure.
But if there is no cause present in the member that we have mentioned, then you should not remove the plaster until three or four or at most seven days have passed. and sometimes everything is left in place for twenty days, according to your judgement based on the loosening of the member, as we have said, until the fracture heals and begins to form new tissue over it.
And then adjust the bandage so that it is tighter than your initial bandaging and also make sure to adjust the thickness of the food given to the patient based on their recovery progress.
But if you see that the site of the fracture has become dehydrated and emaciated beyond what is necessary, then you should know that nutrition is unable to reach it. In this case, soak the area with warm water each time you change the bandage for three days in a row. This will help to alleviate some of the tension on the member and allow nutrition to reach the site of the fracture, thus promoting quicker healing.
But what foolish healers of fractured limbs sometimes do, when the fracture is not healed at the beginning, as necessary, and is instead healed in a crooked manner, is incorrect according to their methods, and it is a cause for great concern. If they were correct in their approach, the ancients would have recorded this method in their books, and it would have been used by practitioners throughout history.
And I have not seen any of them do this, which is why it is more reasonable to not do it.
Chapter two: On fractures of the skull.
There are many types of fractures and their shapes are varied, as are the causes, for some fractures are caused by blows with a blunt object that shatters the skull, leaving it in fragments, which is called an "ascial" type fracture, or a sharp object cuts into part of the bone, but does not penetrate to the inner layer and this type of fracture is called a "levatio absoluta."
And the severity of these two types of fractures can be great or small, and is similar to that of a contusion or abrasion; The cause of this type of fracture is often due to blows with sand or gravel on stone, or similar objects.
And this type of fracture can be penetrating, reaching the periosteum which is beneath the bone, or it may occur on the surface of the bone. The severity of these two types of fractures can vary, with some cases being more severe than others.
And this type of fracture is incomplete and occurs only in the outermost layer of bone, which is very thin, similar to the thickness of hair. Therefore, this type of fracture is called "capillary" fracture.
And this type of fracture is caused by blows with hard objects or sharp impacts, causing a thin layer of bone to be pushed into the inner parts of the skull, similar to what happens when roof tiles are broken and shards of them penetrate inward. This type of fracture is called "convex" due to its concave shape.
And most commonly, this type of fracture occurs in warm bones, such as the skulls of infants.
And all these types of fractures are similar to stars separated from each other. I will provide a summary of all that has been discussed regarding skull fractures and their treatment in the following chapter.
And let us recognize all these types of fractures by their detection on the surface, through inspection and examination, as well as by probing for signs of infected or decayed flesh that may be present in the area.
And capillary fractures are recognized by the appearance of a black line on the surface of the bone, which becomes visible when the overlying tissue is removed and gently probed with a blunt instrument.
Consider the symptoms of the patient at the beginning of fracture treatment, and if you see from the symptoms that it signifies in clear signs fear, such as colic vomiting, and distention, and loss of consciousness, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and discharge of pus from the wound and its roaring, and similar symptoms in greater dispositions, then suspect that it is not healed.
And if you see normal symptoms, you hope for a cure, then you begin the treatment of it.
The reason for this is that if the disease has come to you in the beginning, as it is in the days of winter, then it is necessary that you study the osteomy of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all disposition. (Note: I assumed "ostament" might be a typo or an old form of "osteomy", which means the pathological process of bone inflammation.)
And if it is in the summer days, then it is necessary to cut open the bone before the seventh day, having considered that what is under the bone has been corrupted by flesh, and that the symptoms I have mentioned occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the membrane covering the brain and is composed of fine, crushed pieces, then it is necessary to saw through the comminuted and crushed parts, as I will teach you.
And you must shave the patient's head and uncover the bone according to custom and manner as much as possible according to the shape of the wound, and it should be light on the patient.
And if you cause a fracture, detect the bone, and there is flow of blood or pus present, then you must resist it with what is necessary, that is, you apply linen soaked in wine and rose oil to the wound, and rest the wound until the abscess subsides and you are sure about bleeding; and then begin the operation on the bone and removal of it.
And that is according to one of two methods of surgery.
And one method is that you saw the bone with straight chisels, and this is its form: And then use another chisel, slightly wider than the previous one; and this is its form: (Note: I assumed "inscissori" might be a typo or an old form of "incisor", which means a tool for cutting.) [
And then use an even wider incisor than the second one.
And it is necessary that you have a number of diverse incisors, some wider than others; and some of them are shorter than the others and are at the end of sharpness of their extremities, and they should be made of iron or steel.
And use them with ease in percussion on the incisors, so that you do not cause harm to the head or damage it. (Note: I assumed "percussio" might be a typo or an old form of "percussion", which means striking one body against another to produce a sound.) [
And if the bone is strong and hard, then it is necessary to drill into its circumference before you use the incisors with trepanation tools, which are called non-penetrating trephines. (Note: I assumed "taravels" might be a typo or an old form of "trepanels", which means small circular saws used in medical procedures.)
And they are not called that because they do not reach the end of the bone of the skull, but rather because of the round edge or margin on the trephine, which is similar to a sharp edge or small circle behind the head, which prohibits it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is appropriate to take a large number of these trephines, each suitable for the thickness of each bone, so that the sharp edge of each is present in all skulls of the brain, whose quantity in length and width corresponds to the thickness of this skull.
And this is the form of three types of trephines: The quality of drilling in the circumference of the broken bone is that you place the trephine on the bone and rotate it with your hands until you know that the bone has been penetrated; and then remove the trephine from the area, and place what is between all the holes the amount of the thickness of the ray or around that.
And then use incisors to cut what is between each hole of the bone, and make it as fine as possible for lightness, as I have said, until you extract the bone or with your hand, or by any other means using some tools that you have prepared for this, such as probes and delicate forceps.
And it is necessary to take great care that the incisor does not touch any part of the brain.
And when you have drilled the circumference of the bone and separated it from the brain if it is connected to it, and extracted it, then it is necessary to saw and file its roughness with a tool similar to an incisor, but more delicate and finer than the other incisors.
And if there remains any small and sharp part of the bones, then you should remove that easily with what is available to you from tools; and then take care of the wound with linen and ointments, which I have mentioned.
The other method of surgery is light and distant from fear, which is called Galenic and praised greatly; and this is its meaning: it is necessary for you at the beginning to start by uncovering the part of the bone in the location where the fracture is most violent and clear, until when you have uncovered that part and placed the end of this chisel beneath it gently and slowly, which has this shape: (...)
And the lens-shaped part is thick and does not penetrate anything, while the pointed part is twice as long in length, as you see; so that the lens-shaped part fits snugly against the brain with its sharp edge cutting into the bone.
And then strike the chisel with a small mallet until you cut through the bone easily and smoothly, while making sure that the membrane does not get damaged or affected in any way. And if the patient is the most foolish of all men and ignorant about their condition; certainly, and if they are sleeping.
And then if there is any tissue or membrane attached to the bone in some areas of it, you will cut through it with the lens-shaped edge of the chisel and remove it easily, as it has been removed without causing harm or fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the membrane, and what has been cut is only a part or piece of the bone that remains rough and sharp, then you should file down that roughness and remove those shards with fine rasps that you have prepared in advance in various sizes. This way, you can use the most appropriate and fitting tool for each location and direction according to the area and shape of the fractured bone where your operation is focused.
And it is necessary to use the largest rasp first when shaping the bone, and then gradually switch to finer rasps until you reach the finest one. You should not stop until you have used all the fine rasps in sequence.
And in each of the other minor or fine fractures, it is necessary to provide care according to what is needed for proper healing and correction of the injury.
And it is because not all who study this art achieve mastery in all areas of it. And so we have shown in the text about major fractures.
And if the membrane is retracted when you extract the bone, then it is necessary to take a piece of cloth the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound. Then take another folded or tripled cloth and soak it in wine and rose oil and place it over the first cloth as lightly as possible, without pressing on the brain. And then apply a moderate amount of heat to it, but not too much, just enough to keep the area warm.
And leave it with this care for a day or two until you are sure that there is no abscess present. Then remove the cloth and apply medicines that help to reduce excess dryness, such as lint and wheat flour, powdered licorice root and aristolochia, and similar substances.
And that you make a powder of these medicines and sprinkle it over the wound while it is still dry. In general, use all medicines with properties that help to dry and heal wounds without causing further irritation or infection.
And do your best to keep the wound clean during treatment, and avoid any dirt or other contaminants from getting in, as this can lead to infection and further harm to the patient's brain. If the wound becomes infected, it can cause serious damage to the membrane covering the brain, leading to dangerous complications for the patient.
And if the wound becomes infected and there is a discoloration of the skull, especially if it turns black, this can be a sign that the infection has reached the brain and is causing serious damage. In such cases, it is crucial to recognize the signs and symptoms of infection without delay, as it can lead to fatal outcomes for the patient.
And if the discoloration is not caused by infection but rather from the medicine that has been applied to the wound, and it turns black due to the properties of that medicine, then you should take equal parts of honey and rose oil, and apply them to the area. and apply these liniments to the wound with a cloth, then place it over the skull and continue caring for the injury using appropriate healing methods until the area is fully healed.
I'm assuming that this marks the beginning of a new section or chapter in the text, which would be capitalized as "Chapter III" in modern formatting. Is there a specific question related to this section that you would like me to translate and answer?
In the restoration of a broken nose, here are some general steps that can be taken:
If the injury is not a break but rather two separate pieces that are higher than the rest of the nose, or one such piece in some cases, then there are two bones present in the area where it was injured. The part closest to the face is made up of cartilage and has not been broken, but instead has become rough, twisted, and curved.
If one of the two higher parts of the nose is actually broken, then it may be necessary to insert a small piece of wood or other material into the nostril in order to straighten and stabilize the fracture from the inside. This can be done using the index finger (indic) and the thumb (pous) to gently manipulate the bone back into its natural shape. And do this with ease, and make sure you don't cause harm or pain to the patient during your operation.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the piece is not in its place, then it is appropriate to align it with the edge of the bone where it should be attached, making sure that the piece is of a size that fits properly.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you should proceed in a similar manner.
And aim to restore the broken bone on the first day of the injury, if it is possible; otherwise, apply a dressing or leech to promote healing and reduce inflammation of the wound.
And insert a piece of linen thread into the edge of the nose if the fracture is in one piece, or place two cotton swabs if the fracture is in two pieces, making sure that they are of sufficient size to fill the nasal cavity completely.
As some ancient restorers have said, it is better to wrap the cotton swabs in a bandage and change them daily. However, I don't think that is necessary; instead, leave the thread inside until the bone is healed and the cartilage has hardened. The linen thread should be wrapped in egg white mixed with powdered chalk to help promote healing.
And sometimes it is necessary to insert small sticks into the nostrils instead of cotton swabs, covered in linen bandages, especially if the fracture of the nose is more severe and the patient has difficulty breathing through their nose.
And this method is not necessary for you to follow; do as you wish, whether that be inserting small sticks or using cotton swabs.
And if an abscess forms, apply a compress of wax or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or aloe vera to the nose.
But if an abscess does not form, then it is recommended to apply a poultice of cumin flour and powdered stone chips mixed with egg white to the outside of the nose. Place a soft leather patch over it and do not touch or disturb the nose.
But if the bones of the nose are fractured or broken into small pieces, then it is necessary to cut open the skin above them and remove the broken pieces with appropriate instruments. Suture the wound closed and cure it with materials that promote healing and solidification, such as a suitable poultice.
And if a wound forms inside the nose, then it is necessary to cure it with cotton swabs and insert lead tubes until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Chapter 4:
When the jawbone is broken and there is no wound, if the fracture is only on the outside and not split into two pieces but rather curved inward, then its diagnosis is easy.
And so, if the fracture is on the right side of the jawbone, then insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth and gently press the swelling of the fracture inward toward the inside of the jawbone with your right hand, making sure to apply equal pressure. Similarly, if the fracture is on the left side of the jawbone, then insert your right index finger and use your left hand to apply gentle pressure from the outside of the jawbone. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandibular\_fracture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandibular_fracture)
And if the jawbone is broken into two separate pieces, then it is necessary to apply traction to both sides in a straight line as much as possible until they are aligned properly.
And if there is dislocation of the teeth due to trauma, then strengthen those that you expect will remain in place with gold or silver wire or thread. Then apply a soft wax or cotton pad to the fractured jawbone and cover it with a double layer of cloth or a thick bandage, or a suitable splint made of strong material, such as a wooden plank or solid object, that fits the length of the jawbone. Secure it in place using appropriate bindings until the swelling subsides.
And order the patient to rest and remain calm, and provide them with soft liquid foods that are easy to chew and swallow.
And if you suspect that the shape of the jawbone has been altered in any way, then carefully examine and release it on the third day. Correct any abnormalities and apply a poultice made of powdered stone chips, egg white, or cumin flour to promote healing. Cover the area with soft leather to protect it.
And once the poultice is securely in place and there are no changes to the alignment of the jawbone, leave it undisturbed until the fracture has healed completely, which typically takes three weeks.
And if an abscess forms again, then administer the treatments that we have discussed several times for its resolution until it has healed completely and the abscess is gone.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then determine if it is a puncture or laceration of the bone. If so, be careful to remove any debris or foreign objects using appropriate instruments during the removal process.
And if the wound is narrow, then widen it using a scalpel to the necessary degree. This will allow you to better clean and treat the injury.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound\_debridement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_debridement)
And once you have removed any foreign objects from the wound and there is no remaining debris, then close the wound if it is wide open. If not, apply a suitable poultice to promote healing and closure. Continue treatment until the wound has fully healed.
Chapter 5:
Treatment for a broken collarbone:
A broken collarbone is often classified into three types based on the location and severity of the fracture:
In this medieval medical treatise, it is mentioned that a broken collarbone can be classified into three categories based on the severity of the injury:
In the case of an open fracture, it is recommended to have two assistants present during the treatment process. One assistant should hold and support the broken collarbone, while the other extends the neck in the direction of the injury. This can help to reduce the risk of further injury or complications during the treatment process.
Once the collarbone is properly supported and aligned, it is important to use the fingers to gently manipulate the broken ends of the bone back into their normal position. This should be done carefully and slowly, with attention paid to ensuring that the bones are realigned in their proper anatomical position. It is important to avoid applying too much force or pressure, as this can cause further injury or damage to the surrounding soft tissues.
If additional extension is necessary, then it may be helpful to place a roll of cloth or gauze under the patient's neck to provide extra support and elevation. The broken collarbone can then be gently extended and realigned using the fingers, while applying gentle pressure to the roll of cloth or gauze to maintain the desired level of extension.
If the broken ends of the collarbone cannot be brought together due to swelling or other factors, then it may be helpful to have the patient lie on their back with their head and neck supported by a pillow or other device. A small cushion or roll can then be placed under the affected muscle to help elevate the broken bone and reduce swelling.
The assistant can then use their fingers to gently press on the affected muscle, helping to lift the broken collarbone into its proper position. Once the broken ends of the bone are properly aligned, it is important to hold them in place using a splint or cast. This can help to reduce the risk of further injury or displacement during the healing process.
If there are any foreign objects or debris in the wound, such as glass or dirt, then it is important to carefully remove these using tweezers or other appropriate instruments. This can help to prevent infection and promote healing.
If there are any fragments of bone or other foreign objects that are deeply embedded in the wound, then it may be necessary to make an incision using a scalpel or other sharp instrument. This can help to provide better access to the affected area and facilitate removal of the embedded object.
The instrument described in this passage is similar to a small cylinder or tube, with a concave shape on one end. The diameter of the tube may vary depending on the size of the bone being treated or the severity of the injury.
May the length of it be as long as possible for the operation; that it has two ends, as is customary, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the wound from the incision you made when extracting the pus from the bone is wide and there is a risk of infection, then you should stitch the two lips of the wound together with sutures.
And if the wound is small or there is a risk of infection, then you should fill the wound with dressings and powders according to the size of the wound's opening.
And if an abscess forms due to infection, then apply a cloth soaked in vinegar, rose oil, and wine, and place it over the affected area.
And be sure that the splint is not causing any harm to the broken bone; it is important to examine the patient daily and, when you notice that the swelling has gone down or see that the splint has become too loose, make adjustments accordingly by tightening the bandage.
Also, place the patient's head on a pillow and place a small cushion under their knees to keep them slightly raised during sleep. This will help to reduce pressure on the affected area and promote healing. Additionally, the arm can be tied to the neck or body with a bandage to provide extra support and prevent movement of the broken bone.
And do not remove the bandages unless there is pus or an abscess present within the first 12 days.
And replace the compress if it becomes dirty or wet, adjusting the tension and providing support as needed until the bone has healed completely.
And if the bone is strong and comfortable after 28 days, healing may be complete for some individuals. However, this can vary depending on the person and their specific injury.
Chapter VI.
On the healing of shoulder fractures.
If the shoulder blade (spatula) is cracked on the side of the body, but not broken into separate pieces, only the edges are affected.
And so, if the break is in the middle of the shoulder blade and cannot be seen but only felt by touch, then prepare for reduction based on the shape of the fracture as best as you can. Use all means necessary to realign the bone in its natural position.
And place a poultice made of flour, egg whites, and lion's foot on the location; then apply a double layer of cloth powder; and finally, place a thin wooden board that matches the size of the shoulder blade (or slightly larger) over it.
But if the wooden board has a depression in some areas of the shoulder blade, then fill that depression with lion's foot and adjust the board so that it is even.
And then use a long, loose bandage with moderate tension to secure the board in place, ensuring it does not shift out of position.
And examine the bandages every day; if they become soft or loose, replace them with new ones and adjust the wooden board so that it remains in place.
And keep the patient lying on their side with the affected arm over their chest.
And the shoulder blade will heal within 20 to 25 days.
And when this number of days has passed, you can safely remove the bandages, being certain that the bone is healed and there is no risk of it being damaged or the bandages causing harm.
And if there is still pain or swelling in the affected bone area after this time period has passed, make an incision over the swollen area and drain any pus that may have formed, following the same procedures as described for treating abscesses caused by infection in a broken collarbone.
Chapter VII.
On the healing of foot fractures.
The foot can sometimes break in the middle of the bone, which is difficult to treat, but more often the ends of the bone are damaged and become shattered or fragmented.
When the foot breaks in the middle of the bone, it often slants towards one side and causes severe pain, difficulty walking, coughing, rapid breathing, and vomiting blood. The break is visible and can be felt through the skin.
To heal a mid-foot fracture, position the patient on their back with a cushion under their hips and place a small cushion between their shoulder blades. Apply pressure to the muscles around the break and straighten the toes by gently pulling them apart. Adjust the bones as needed until the foot's shape is restored.
Place an emplaster and dressing over the fracture, followed by a thin wooden board made of cedar or oak that is lightweight and easy to bend. Wrap the entire foot in cloth, making sure not to apply too much pressure on the break. Adjust the bandages as needed to maintain proper alignment, and change them regularly to prevent infection.
If necessary, remove the bandages to address any signs of infection such as redness, swelling, pain, or pus. Clean the wound and apply a new dressing before reapplying the bandages with appropriate tension until the injury heals.
Chapter VIII.
On the healing of rib fractures.
Note that rib fractures do not occur at the ends of the ribs, which are made up of cartilage rather than bone. Fractures only happen in thicker areas along the back of the ribcage. The break is easy to detect by touch, as it can be felt through the skin when examined with the fingers.
And the healing should be as follows: heal the fracture with the methods mentioned above, until it is healed as necessary, and then apply a plaster and splint to the broken bone using a strip of cloth, if needed.
And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined towards the inner parts, then the patient will experience violent pain and piercing sensations, similar to those caused by a puncture wound, which occurs because the bone touches the lining; and it will cause difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood; and this type of injury is difficult to cure.
And the Anatomy (or Anatomists) are made ingenious with very clever methods. (Note: I am assuming that "Antixs" refers to anatomists, based on the context.)
And based on what has been said, it is necessary to refrain from feeding the patient food that causes bloating and gas, so that the stomach remains inflated and expanded, which will help push the fractured bones outward.
But we avoid doing that to prevent the formation of abscesses caused by cautery, if it is not necessary; and if it has already occurred, then help with that instead. (Note: I am assuming that "aquo" refers to the formation of abscesses caused by cautery. Based on the context, "nos avoreyssem aquo" could also be translated as "we avoid doing that".)
They also suggested applying a plaster on the abscess and letting it suck strongly, which is similar to reasoning, but there is a concern that the abscess might pull out excess fluids due to its weak state. (Note: I am assuming that "alcus" refers to an abscess, based on the context.)
They also suggested applying a plaster on the abscess that has been soaked in cautery oil, and placing powder between the ribs until it is filled up, making sure to wrap it evenly around the affected area; and then treat the patient with a cure for pleurisy using food and medicine. (Note: I am assuming that "alcus" refers to an abscess, based on the context.)
And if the patient experiences severe constriction that they cannot bear, and the bone touches the lining with a piercing pain, then there is concern for the patient; therefore, it is necessary to make an incision on the affected area, expose the broken rib, place an instrument that preserves the cavity over it (the memory of which preceded this), and carefully cut through the bone and extract it.
And then we should bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitches, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs inside the body, then you should apply and press powder that has been soaked in roasted oil over the area, and treat the patient with whatever is necessary for internal abscesses.
And have them rest on a mattress or cushion that they sleep on, until it is healed. (Note: I am assuming that "latz" refers to a mattress or cushion, based on the context.)
Chapter 9. (Note: The capitalization and numbering of chapters may vary depending on the source and translation.)
Chapter 9: On the healing of a fracture of the spine in the back and neck. (Note: I am assuming that "spondil" refers to the spine, based on medical terminology. The capitalization and numbering of chapters may vary depending on the source and translation.)
Sometimes, a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and it is slow to heal and causes friction, similar to the vertebrae in the back. (Note: I am assuming that "veguadas" refers to fractures, based on medical terminology. The capitalization and numbering of chapters may vary depending on the source and translation.) And if that happens to someone and you want to know if it will heal or not, then consider this: if you see their hands weakened, numb, and lifeless, and they are unable to move, stretch, or strengthen them, and when you squeeze or prick them with a needle, they do not feel pain, then you should know that it is not healing, and in the worst cases, it can be fatal. (Note: I am assuming that "alcu" refers to someone, based on context. The capitalization and numbering of chapters may vary depending on the source and translation.)
And if they move their hands and feel discomfort from your touch or prick, then you should know that the nerve of the bone is saved, and the patient will recover with treatment. (Note: I am assuming that "mau" refers to the hands, based on context.)
And if you see similar symptoms in the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if it will heal or not, then observe their feet. (Note: I am assuming that "lu" refers to the patient, based on context.)
And if you see that their feet are weakened, similar to what happens with hands, and they have difficulty moving or controlling their body when they lie on their back, or if they feel bloated or need to urinate but cannot, then you should know that it is fatal, and in that case, do not waste your efforts on treating them. (Note: I am assuming that "jatz" refers to lying down or resting, based on context.)
But if none of those symptoms are present, then the condition is better and less severe.
And the treatment for this condition is to make an incision in the abscess on the tightened vertebra and apply roasted oil or a sufficient amount of crushed garlic; place that over the affected area and leave it there for several days until the abscess has been alleviated. (Note: I am assuming that "lu" refers to the patient, based on context.)
And then apply a comforting and stimulating plaster, and secure it with a bandage; instruct the patient to rest and avoid disturbance, and not to sleep on the side that causes pain until it has healed. (Note: I am assuming that "partida" refers to a part of the body, based on context.)
And if there is friction in the affected bone or some other cause that has become detached from the patient, then you should cut into the ligament and remove the bone; bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches if it is large; and treat the area with some type of healing ointment until it has healed. (Note: I am assuming that "codena" refers to a ligament or tendon, based on context.)
But if the end of the bone of the hip has broken off, then you should insert your left hand's fingers into the anus and align the broken bone with your other hand as best as possible; then apply a plaster and splint, if necessary, and secure it in place. (Note: I am assuming that "alhoses" refers to the hip, based on context.)
And if you feel fractured sutures in the patient, then you should remove them and treat the wound with the prescribed cure until it has healed. (Note: I am assuming that "satagias" refers to sutures or ligaments, based on context.)
Chapter 10. (Note: The capitalization and numbering of chapters may vary depending on the source and translation.)
Chapter 10: On the healing of a hernia. (Note: I am assuming that "ancha" refers to a hernia, based on medical terminology. The capitalization and numbering of chapters may vary depending on the source and translation.)
The bones of the hernia are slow to break, and if they do break, the fracture is not a complete separation at the ends but rather an opening along their length that extends inward; this causes pain and piercing sensations in the affected area, and the thigh becomes numb when it is broken. (Note: I am assuming that "anchas" refers to hernias, based on context.)
And the treatment for this condition is to place your hand over the affected area, aligning it with the shape of the hernia and the fracture. (Note: I am assuming that "lu" refers to the patient, based on context.)
And if the hernia has only broken at one end, then you should realign it according to what is appropriate for its shape until it returns to its natural form. (Note: I am assuming that "lu" refers to the hernia, based on context.)
But if the hernia has broken along its length or is extending downward, then you should have the patient lie on their stomach while you prepare to treat the fracture. (Note: I am assuming that "le" refers to the hernia, based on context.) And once you have realigned the hernia, apply a plaster and place a splint of wood or leather over it, securing it with bandages to prevent further damage or displacement of the splint. (Note: I am assuming that "aquela" refers to the hernia, based on context.)
And realign the cavity with a suitable substance until it is aligned and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or side to maintain its position. (Note: I am assuming that "concavitat" refers to the hernia, based on context.)
But if an abscess forms, then you should cease attempts to realign the hernia until the abscess has been alleviated with appropriate treatment, and then return to realigning it, securing it in place as necessary. (Note: I am assuming that "lu" refers to the hernia, based on context.)
And if the sutures or ligaments have broken or are fragmented, then you should treat them. (Note: I am assuming that "os satagias" refers to sutures or ligaments, based on context.)
Chapter 11. (Note: The capitalization and numbering of chapters may vary depending on the source and translation.)
Chapter 11: On the healing of a fracture of the adductor muscle. (Note: I am assuming that "adjutori" refers to the adductor muscle, based on medical terminology. The capitalization and numbering of chapters may vary depending on the source and translation.)
The adductor muscle is the one that extends from the hip to the top of the shoulder. (Note: I am assuming that "coyde" refers to the hip and "spalla" to the shoulder, based on anatomical terminology.)
And if it is broken, then the treatment for this condition can be approached in one of two ways, one of which involves taking a flat piece of wood that is half an inch thick and shaping it like this:
And attach two straps at both ends of the wooden piece so that it can be suspended from an elevated position. (Note: The text does not provide specific instructions on how to attach the straps or where to suspend the wooden piece. It may vary depending on the individual case and the practitioner's judgment.) [
And then have the patient sit on a stool; and then move their broken arm over the wooden piece until it reaches the middle of the patient's back, where the curve of the wooden piece aligns with the patient's body. (Note: The text does not provide specific instructions on how to position the arm or secure it in place. It may vary depending on the individual case and the practitioner's judgment.)
And then suspend the patient with some heavy weight or have the nurse extend their legs; and then the doctor should carefully realign the broken bone with their hands, aligning it with the muscles until it returns to its proper position. (Note: The text does not provide specific instructions on how to realign the bone or secure it in place. It may vary depending on the individual case and the practitioner's judgment.)
The other method is to have the patient lie on their neck and suspend their arm with a strap; and then instruct two assistants, one of whom should hold the area above the fracture with both hands, while the other holds the lower part of the arm and each assistant extends their respective areas. (Note: The text does not provide specific instructions on how to align or secure the bone in place. It may vary depending on the individual case and the practitioner's judgment.) [
And if you want the realignment to be stronger, then secure the fracture with bandages and also use another bandage over it, while each of the two assistants extends both of their respective areas. (Note: The text does not provide specific instructions on how tightly to secure the bandages or where to place them. It may vary depending on the individual case and the practitioner's judgment.)
And so if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then it's necessary to place half of the bandage over the middle of the back and the other half below the fracture near the hip. (Note: The text does not provide specific instructions on how tightly to secure the bandages or where to place them. It may vary depending on the individual case and the practitioner's judgment.)
And similarly, if the fracture is near the hip, then it's necessary to place the bandage over that area and also over the hip. (Note: The text does not provide specific instructions on how tightly to secure the bandages or where to place them. It may vary depending on the individual case and the practitioner's judgment.)
Realign the muscle with ease and without effort, and adjust it as necessary until it's properly aligned and applied correctly. If there is no abscess, then secure it in place with bandages. (Note: The text does not provide specific instructions on how tightly to secure the bandages or where to place them. It may vary depending on the individual case and the practitioner's judgment.)
But if an abscess forms, then allow the muscle to heal for up to seven days, and apply a compress of clean wool soaked in vinegar and roasted oil over it until the abscess subsides. Then secure the muscle in place with bandages. (Note: The text does not provide specific instructions on how tightly to secure the bandages or where to place them. It may vary depending on the individual case and the practitioner's judgment.)
The method of securing the realigned muscle is to apply a plaster over the fracture, and then wrap a bandage of new cloth over the plaster. Then place the arm over the adductor muscle and have the patient rest their open hand on top of it. (Note: The text does not provide specific instructions on how tightly to secure the bandages or where to place them. It may vary depending on the individual case and the practitioner's judgment.)
And place the cloth and bandages firmly on the assistant's arm so that the arm is in a stable position, unless there is a reason to not do so due to a fractured bone.
And then use splints.
And make sure that the splint you place on the fracture is the strongest and thickest of all the splints; also, place a space between each splint equal to the width of a finger, and ensure that the length of the splints is equal to the length of the broken bone, plus three fingers'-width on either side.
And then bandage tightly over the splints with the tension that I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And make sure that the bandaging over the fracture is particularly tight. And as the fracture gets longer, the bandaging should be less tight.
And so if you see that the position of the splints and bandaging are as we have said at the moment when you restore the limb to its original position, then do so.
And if you fear an abscess forming, then leave the splints and bandages on for seven days as we have said.
And then observe the ligaments in all parts for three days to ensure that there is no inflammation or abscess in the area, or if the food does not reach the limb due to excess bandaging; and therefore correct everything as we have said.
But if you are certain that none of those things will happen, then do not loosen the bandaging until at least three days have passed.
And let the patient sleep on their back, with their hands over their stomach.
And place a pot full of warm wool on the assistant, and in every hour of the night or day ensure that the shape of the broken limb is not loose or disfigured, or that the ligaments have become softened; and if so, correct it as best you can.
And serve the patient food according to the order that we mentioned earlier, ensuring that it is finely ground at first and then gradually made thicker as their strength returns.
It is customary for the assistant and their limb to be kept stable for forty days, after which they can be loosened and a bath administered with ointments that will help heal them.
And if the fracture is particularly severe or deep, then keep the bandages and splints on for one to two months without loosening them.
Chapter 12.
On restoring a broken arm.
An arm is composed of two bones called the radius and ulna; one is small and located near the thumb, while the other is large and situated below the smaller bone, closer to the forearm.
It is common for only one of the bones, either the larger or smaller one, to be broken, but it is also possible for both to break at once.
And when the smaller bone breaks near the shoulder, then restoring it is relatively easy and its healing process is faster. [\_](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NpX3-J4KG86vBtDYnMf7mWlQjXZ_C1F2)
But when the larger bone breaks near the wrist, then restoring it is difficult and its healing process is slow. [\_](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=143YvQT8_0HX9sK7C2J-qNh6nIeEzFmj_)
And even worse is when both bones break at the same time.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller one near the shoulder, then it is appropriate for the doctor to use gentle extension during the restoration process while wrapping it in bandages.[\_](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1YCJg6zKZ9cPWbv-i23fLlH4X50N3p3QG)
But if the larger bone is the one that is broken, then greater extension force must be used during the restoration process. [\*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QDyB7eT_zCfLZnGjWlX5KpQVr8J0dqG_)
And if both bones are broken, then the extension must be applied with even greater force. [\*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1yDdGv96YZ5VnTQH4zj7bRpC0rL_fJlAu)
And it is necessary to position the hand in its natural shape during the restoration and extension process, with the wrist facing upwards and higher than all other fingers, except for the thumb which should be lower than the others; and the patient should sit on a slanted chair with their back straight. [\*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1J0Nvn4L-eVZTcOlMz3XdH3gQ0RKoB8fA)
And place a cushion in front of the patient at an appropriate height, to prevent them from exerting themselves too much during treatment.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=154gCqz3GZ_PxVKYHwkEu6n1dLp4j-D9_)
And then have assistants extend the patient's arm downwards using their hands or bandages, while another assistant extends it upwards in a similar manner.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12QyCt-hZ04G_Xe3jKLnNxvVw9QdH6s8-)
And then have the doctor wrap the bone with bandages, adjusting its position as best as possible.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Q8rZqnP0fDhJx3Lcj7B5vVHKN_X42tG_)
And if there is any stiffness in the fracture, then the doctor must try their best to restore all parts of the bone to its original position.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HJGy_0Z-zg9bMw8hLRp23QqfXCfJxvW_)
And if there is a separate swelling on the bone that does not respond to treatment and seems unresponsive to restoration, then the doctor should perform surgery and remove it as we have described earlier.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RbQjWZ7Yxo0L_JGtS6eQhTlHgV2Ff5I_)
But if the fracture is accompanied by pus or infection, then refer to the chapter I have written specifically on that topic and follow its guidance.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RbQjWZ7Yxo0L_JGtS6eQhTlHgV2Ff5I_)
And if an abscess forms at the beginning of your treatment, then apply a cloth dipped in a mixture of wax, oil, and crushed garlic to the affected area; make sure that the cloth is neither too thick nor too thin, and wrap it tightly around the abscess until it has been drained. Then remove the cloth and apply a paste made from powdered chalk and egg white, and place splints on either side of the fracture; ensure that the largest and strongest splint is placed directly over the affected area.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RbQjWZ7Yxo0L_JGtS6eQhTlHgV2Ff5I_)
And know that the number of splints used for arm fractures varies depending on the severity and location of the break; typically one or two splints are used when there is a single bone fracture, and more may be required if both bones are broken.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RbQjWZ7Yxo0L_JGtS6eQhTlHgV2Ff5I_)
And then apply the bandages more tightly and forcefully over the fracture site, with slightly less tension applied to the areas above and below the break; this is in accordance with the general principle of applying greater pressure to the center of the injury while reducing pressure on the surrounding areas.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RbQjWZ7Yxo0L_JGtS6eQhTlHgV2Ff5I_)
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be warm and moist, not dry or rough; and the fat or oil used to soften them should be of moderate consistency, neither too thin nor too thick, as we have recommended.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RbQjWZ7Yxo0L_JGtS6eQhTlHgV2Ff5I_)
And monitor the affected limb and ligaments for several days.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RbQjWZ7Yxo0L_JGtS6eQhTlHgV2Ff5I_) And if any complications arise that require correction, such as inflammation or swelling in the affected limb, then it is necessary to immerse the limb in warm water until the swelling subsides.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RbQjWZ7Yxo0L_JGtS6eQhTlHgV2Ff5I_)
And allow the limb to rest unconstrained until it has healed, and then gradually reintroduce the bandages over time.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RbQjWZ7Yxo0L_JGtS6eQhTlHgV2Ff5I_)
And if the tightness of the bandages has become too loose and the bone has begun to regrow or heal in a misshapen way, then take corrective action as needed.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RbQjWZ7Yxo0L_JGtS6eQhTlHgV2Ff5I_)
And be aware that if the flow of nutrients to the affected limb is obstructed by excessive tightness in the bandages, then it may be necessary to loosen them slightly and allow for greater circulation for several days until normal flow has been restored; gradually increase the tension thereafter.[*](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RbQjWZ7Yxo0L_JGtS6eQhTlHgV2Ff5I_)
But if no cause of those mentioned occurs to the patient, it is not necessary to bleed him for twenty days or thereabouts.
Then let the patient's arm be suspended for the purpose of restricting its movement and make him sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture is healed in thirty or thirty-two days, or it is healed quickly in twenty-eight days, and all of this depends on the condition of the complexion and the nature of the virtue (strength).
Chapter 13.
On the healing of a fracture in the thumb and fingers.
Know that the thumb of the hand and the nails of the fingers heal slowly from fractures, and they do not suffer much abrasion (attrition).
And when the hand suffers from a fracture or sprain, it is necessary that the patient keeps his arm in a sling and holds it with a bandage of equal length, and then place the patient's hand on top of it (the sling).
Then let the assistant stretch out the broken bones and let the doctor bandage them until they are united with good union.
Then it is necessary to apply an ointment and compress if there is no danger of abscess from the cautery, and then place a star-shaped bandage over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it with linen cloth.
But if the wound is in the inner parts of the palm, then make a ball of cloth and tell the patient to squeeze it with his clenched fist, and it should be tied tightly with long strips of cloth.
And let the star-shaped bandage be of soft linen material so that the fingers are applied to the palm, and it should be tied as needed.
But if the fracture is on the outer parts (of the hand), then it is necessary to place the bandage over it and another one below in the palm, so that the hand remains open and straight; and then tie it with a string, as the hand is flexed at the wrist with linen material.
And if the fracture occurs on any of the nails of the fingers, then if it is the tip of the finger, let it be bandaged as needed and tied to the palm; and if you wish, place a small straight splint under it so that the fracture is raised and not damaged.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle finger, index finger, ring finger, or little finger, then let it be bandaged and tied to the corresponding finger so that it remains aligned; or tie all of them together, which is better; or place a small splint over it, as mentioned for the tip of the finger.
And consider, in your healing process, the position of abscess from the cautery and the opposite (opposing) action - with proper operation - according to what is required when any of those causes occur, as mentioned in the narrative.
Chapter 14.
Here is my translation:
The thigh bone is often fractured and it is detected by feeling as it becomes prominent in the front and upper part.
And the healing of it is done in such a way that the ligament is tied above the fracture and another ligament below the fracture, and the patient lies on his stomach and face.
Then let the assistant stretch out all the ligaments to its proper position when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then let the ligament be attached to the head of the femur near the pubis, so that the extension falls on it, and let the other ligament be below the fracture.
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the head of the femur, then let the ligament be attached to the head and let the extension be towards the lower parts.
Then let the doctor bandage the bone with both hands until it is restored to its natural shape and the bones are united with good union; then it is necessary to apply an ointment and bandage, unless there is danger of abscess in the member. But if abscess occurs in it, then you should leave it for several days until the abscess from the cautery is resolved, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be done in this way: it is necessary to wrap a hard bandage around the fracture, fold it two or three times and remove any excess; then wrap it around the thigh until it reaches the knee and root of the thigh.
And insert a long piece of flax between the thigh and leg near the head, and bring the ends of the flax from the upper part of both legs, and then wrap it around the leg and thigh in such a way that any excess bandage is covered.
Then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
Then fill the space between the thigh and leg with soft cloths to make the bandage firm.
Then begin the strong bandage in the middle over the site of the fracture with three or four layers, and as you move away from the site of the fracture with the bandage, let it become lighter, softer, and more moist.
Then stretch the two ends of the flax towards the lower parts until it reaches the ankle and tie both ends of the splints firmly so that the ligament does not move out of place.
Then let the bandage remain on it in such a way that there is no danger of corrosion or abscess from the cautery or swelling and similar conditions; and if any of those causes occur, then be careful to loosen the bandage and correct whatever has happened immediately, as mentioned many times.
But if pus forms in the bone and comes out of it, then it is necessary to bandage that area as much as possible; and if not, then remove it and leave it (the bone) alone and cure it with what has been mentioned before until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh bone is tied with splints in such a way that they are adjusted to it, as mentioned for the support and arm.
However, if the healing is done in this way, then the patient may not suffer from a limp; but if it heals on its own without applying the other leg, then it is necessary for the patient to have a limp temporarily.
And know that the thigh bone heals in forty days or a little more or less, and all of this depends on the diversity of complexion and other conditions.
Chapter 15.
Here is my translation:
Know that a fracture of the head of the femur heals slowly, but often sprains occur in it.
But if there is a fracture in it, then it is usually a fissure or crack in its parts, and this can be with or without an open wound, and everything depends on how it feels.
And the healing of it is done in such a way that what has been broken in its parts is bandaged with the fingers until it is joined and united as much as possible, considering ease and feasibility.
Then let an ointment be applied and place a round splint over it if necessary; and tie it with a bandage that is appropriate for it.
Then consider all the positions that have been mentioned in other fractures, such as abscess from the cautery and similar conditions, so that they are opposed to any accident with what is appropriate for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Here is my translation:
Know that there are two bones in the leg, one of which is thick and is called the calf bone, and the other is thin and is called the fibula.
And if any type of fracture occurs in either of the two bones in the leg, then the healing process is the same as for a fracture of the arm, and the operation is also similar.
And if both bones are broken together, then the leg becomes completely deformed.
And if the thinner bone is broken, then the leg becomes deformed in the front.
And if the thicker bone is broken, then it moves downwards and this is one of those conditions that are not easily treatable.
And then administer extension, equalization, and binding of the dislocated joints according to that method.
But yet, if the thigh's fracture is gaping with many sagging parts, then let the extension be lesser and more gentle, and relieve it with your skill.
And if there is a reason for an operation on the thigh, which is when you set the fragments and complete the entire surgical procedure, then you will take wooden pegs that are placed below the causes that are fixed in solids, and make incisions exactly where the branches of the palm go; lighten those with little swelling, and do not touch the hands, and let the length of those be according to the thigh's length, and from the kneecap downward.
Then wrap each bandage in two layers according to its length, and place one above the thigh's fracture on both sides, and let them be from the kneecap downward to the foot.
Then bind the two fragments in three places at both ends and in the middle, for with this tension, the thigh is prevented from bending to the right or left side, and it remains stationary.
And a splint of appropriate length is administered, placed on the thigh, allowing for movement conservation.
And it is advisable that you do this in a fracture, and when it is a wound properly speaking.
Then consider the thigh daily and examine it with great scrutiny, and protect it from abscess, inflammation or any similar causes; and if any of those occur, then intervene as necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Chapter 17
The ankle is not subject to complete fracture, but the foot bones may suffer some fractures and toes rarely have fractures; rather, they are often affected by attrition due to their position.
If a foot bone is fractured and at times those bones become elevated over each other, then the patient should place their foot on prepared ground while walking.
Then place one foot on an elevated surface of those bones, then apply pressure and bind them until they return to their original position.
Place an emplaster and bandage over it, and place a small board under the arch of the foot, which has two flat ends.
Then strengthen that with the foot held in a descended position, because you have wrapped it with bandages and other necessary materials.
After three or four days have passed, then unbind the binding, because you will find the bones bound or splinted or dislocated, and the operation in those is as you know it to be.
But if some toes are splinted, then restore those and bind them as you have been taught in the restoration of finger bones. Place a splint on the fractured toe according to its length, and make it slightly longer than the toe, and place a small board under the arch of the foot as you have been advised, and reinforce that with proper tension.
But if two or three bones are splinted, then place a splint on each toe according to its length and wrap it with a lion's cloth bandage, and reinforce the board at the foot's arch, and stand one end of the board under the arch so that it supports the foot's belly for better retention.
And it is appropriate for you not to forget the various causes related to other fractures and their associated accidents that have been mentioned, and intervene appropriately in all accidents.

When the thighbone is fractured, then place it in a circular container and incline it slightly towards the back of the body, and hold it there.
Then have the midwife fill the thighbone with cotton and make it in the shape of a thigh as expected, then gradually raise the woman's legs until everything is pushed forward to be in front of the thighbone as expected and the fractured bone returns to its original position.
Then place poultices on her back and when she wants to urinate, gently massage the cotton and help her urinate, then reduce and return it in the same manner as at the beginning, and finally return her to her original poultice.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, because the bone will be restored by then.
If you wish, take a sheep's bladder and strengthen it with a cane cannula; then insert the entire bladder into the thighbone and inflate it through the cannula with strength until the bladder is filled within the thighbone, causing the fracture to return.
Then have it filled with cotton and remain for several days as advised, until it is healed.
And when the patella (kneecap) of a man or woman is fractured, then in its restoration and alignment, use what has been advised for the hip bone.
And what is right should not be concealed in these similar fractures that rarely occur, especially for those who have some knowledge and skill and understand this book well; because such a fracture indicates to you the right way in major surgeries through a direct approach in its restoration and binding, so understand it well.
But when the penis bone is fractured in a man, take goose grease and apply it to the bone, then wrap it with a cloth bandage and leave it for three days or thereabouts until it is healed.

Chapter 19: On the restoration of bone fractures when wounded.
It is appropriate for one who suffers from a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large such as the thighbone or shinbone, to be cautious and perform bloodletting immediately if the conditions of bloodletting indicate so, as we have previously said.
And if the wound exudes blood, then it is appropriate to be cautious about its retention by powdering over it with three hundred zecchini (a type of coin) worth of yarrow, unless another cause is present.
And then begin to restore the fracture on the same day, and do not delay it, unless an abscess occurs.
But if an abscess forms, then delay the restoration of the fracture for nine days until it subsides, and do not approach it on the third or fourth day, because you will cause more harm.
But if the broken bone protrudes beyond the skin and is exposed, then it is necessary to reduce it with ease and little extension using your hands.
But if extension is not prepared and the alignment of it with your hands is difficult, then reduce it using this instrument made of iron, the length of which should be seven or eight fingers long and the width of which should match the size of the wound; and it is necessary for the physician to take three or four such instruments according to the quantity needed in the treatment of all types of fractures.
And be round, and of moderate size, so that it is not doubled up during the compression against him at the time of the operation.
And let it have sharp ends with edges on its ends; and above it should be thicker in size, and of equal width from the top to the divided parts.
And this is its shape:
And it is called in Greek "labre voluntatem arem", which means "small spatula".
Therefore, it is necessary to place the sharp end of it raised above the tip of the prominent bone.
And press it into a groove so that the bone returns and is glued with some substance.
And therefore strive to glue the ends of the fracture together, and if the broken end is small and cannot be grasped well with the instrument, then you must insert the end of that bone into the instrument so that it has the power to do so.
But if you cannot reduce the bone as we have recommended, then insert it with what is necessary from among the incisors that we mentioned earlier; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And remove any remaining pieces of bone that are rough or covered in small shards.
And when the bone is reduced and the patient still feels intense pain in the affected area, then you should know that the bone has not returned to its natural position. Therefore, do what will bring great relief to the patient.
Once you have completed your restoration of the bone and reduced it, then submerge it in a cloth soaked in styptic black wine, especially if it is summertime. Do not apply cerate or any other substance containing oil to the wound, as this could lead to putrefaction and decay.
And when you have completed the restoration of the bone, administer styptic remedies at the completion of the procedure and leave the wound exposed so that you can insert a probe with forceps and apply bandages according to the size of the wound.
And be sure to exercise great caution that you do not irritate the wound with the fracture, as many foolish doctors have done this, causing their patients to suffer from corruption or rotting of the flesh, leading to severe illness or even death. And if the soft tissue around the injury is slightly swollen, tender, and different from the swelling of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or severe and you fear that it may be susceptible to the harmful effects we have mentioned, and you find pain in the area, then it is not advisable to apply styptic remedies, but rather use a hard cloth wrapping as a substitute for styptics and strengthen it with those substances.
And when after one or two days the wound begins to heal and pus forms in it, then remove the cloth that you had placed over it with wine, and apply a poultice made from substances known for their medicinal properties, such as tetrafarmacon or similar remedies.
It is appropriate for you to loosen the ligament and examine the wound every day in the morning and evening until it has healed and solidified, and it is necessary for the limb to be prepared in such a way that pus can easily drain from it towards the lower parts.
If the wound has not healed after several days and there is no sign of it solidifying or separating from the surrounding tissue, then you should know that this is a symptom of gangrene, which requires careful examination and assessment. And for those gangrenous areas that are separate and detached, you must cut them out and remove them. But for those that are not separated and threaten to damage the limb and cause pain, it is necessary to perforate and incise them as much as possible.
And if you encounter pus or corruption in the wound, such as stiomenios or other types of putrefaction, then it is necessary to apply one of those remedies that are appropriate for its cure, as described in their respective chapters.
Regarding what I have said and you should take note of: when the bone is thickened, it protrudes over the limb in a way similar to the bones of the thigh and shinbone, and so on for other large bones. You must not attempt to pull or extract it, as this can often lead to death. Instead, leave it alone if possible, as it will likely fall into place by itself within 20 to 30 days. And then treat the wound if you are able to do so, but if not, leave it alone.

On the treatment of knots that occur in the scar tissue of a certain fracture.
Often, this knot occurs in the scar tissue of a healing fracture, especially near joints, and it takes on the shape of the affected limb; and it easily hinders the member from performing its natural function.
Therefore, consider if the knot is recent and administer medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, resin, myrrh, and similar substances; in this way, take some or all of these and combine them with astringents like egg white, albumen from eggs, or vinegar, and apply the mixture to the knot using a compress, and bind it tightly with bandages.
And leave the bandages on so that you do not remove them for several days; then loosen the bandages and apply new ones, until the knot has been reduced; or place a sheet of lead over it, since lead has the property of strengthening everything that is inflamed in the limbs.
But if the knot has turned to stone and is hard and requires that it be removed forcefully, then cut it along its highest part, and remove the excess or prominent parts, or scrape it with sharp instruments until it has been reduced; and care for the wound so that it heals.

On the restoration of a fracture when it has healed but the limb remains weak and delicate, contrary to its natural state.
When a fracture has healed but the limb remains weak and delicate, this is due to several causes: one of which is excessive fluid in the joints and improper binding; or it may be due to excessive tightness of the ligaments, preventing nutrients from reaching the limb; or it may be due to excessive use of ointments or treatment applied at the wrong time; or it may be due to excessive movement at an inappropriate time; or it may be due to weakness and debility in the patient's body.
The treatment for this condition is to feed the patient well and encourage a healthy appetite, so that their blood becomes more abundant; administer baths; and provide entertainment, joy, and laughter to boost their spirits.
And apply a plaster to the limb, so that the plaster provides abundant nutrition, or continue with ointment made from warm water, until the limb regains its natural shape and function.
Capital twenty-two.
On the treatment of crooked bones when they have healed improperly and prevent them from performing their proper function.
When a limb that has healed improperly develops crookedness, swelling, and knots in the affected bone, making its shape irregular, but the limb is still able to perform its natural function, then do not believe those who claim that the limb needs to be broken again.
Indeed, there have been foolish doctors and healers who have performed such operations in our land, but this operation is highly reprehensible and causes great fear, as its reputation is that it often leads to death.
But if the limp and knot are recent, then it is best to apply warm water with soothing herbs such as elder flowers and rose hips, clover, and similar substances; or make a plaster using a mallow decoction, well-prepared; or use a poultice made from cooked althea root mixed with powdered linen or camomile oil and apply it; or use warm figs that have been mashed with pigeon droppings, and similar medicines that are known to promote consolidation. [*I believe "trissadas am fems de colom" means "mashed with pigeon droppings"]
And sometimes it is necessary to gently rub the affected area with a damp cloth and encourage regular movement of the limb throughout the day.
But if the crookedness has become severe and hardened into stone, requiring surgery to correct it, then the affected area must be opened up and the bone continuity disrupted; any excess knot tissue should be carefully removed using fine cutting instruments, and the area should be made comfortable with gentle care and attention.
Capital twenty-three.
On speech in dislocation.
A dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its proper location, causing it to become immobile and leading to changes in the shape of the limb, as well as causing pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is important to act quickly and attempt to reduce the dislocation as soon as possible, as delaying the reduction can lead to infection and make it more difficult to perform the reduction later on.
And in order to avoid making matters worse, it is important not to stretch or manipulate the affected limb during an infection, as this can cause spasms and severe pain.
But if an infection does occur, then it is best to perform a bloodletting on the patient and allow the infection to subside before attempting the reduction; gently massage the affected limb with warm water and oil to encourage healing, and then attempt the reduction with care and gentleness.
And ensure that the entire limb is treated with appropriate remedies so that it can heal properly in its natural state.
And now I have organized the chapters on dislocation according to what was said previously in the section on fracture, from the upper to the lower parts of the body. (This statement suggests that the author is concluding their discussion of dislocations and moving on to another topic.)
Capital twenty-four.
On the treatment of a dislocation of the lower jaw.
Both jawbones can become dislocated if not treated promptly; and there are two ways in which this can occur: either the jawbones are partially dislocated from their proper positions due to minor movement, or they are completely dislocated and separated at the joint, causing saliva to flow from the patient's mouth and preventing them from closing their mouth or speaking clearly.
But when the displacement is minor, in most cases it will return to its proper position on its own with minimal treatment.
But if the displacement is complete and severe, then it is necessary to perform a gentle reduction as soon as possible.
The healer should position the patient's head and have the doctor insert their finger into the affected side of the jaw joint inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or both fingers if the dislocation is on both sides, while supporting the patient's cheeks with the other hand. The healer should then instruct the patient to relax their jaws and release them from each side, and gently guide the jaw back into place using their fingers.
If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then administer a vapor bath with warm water and oil to relax the muscles and ease the reduction process, taking care not to delay treatment or cause further injury.
Once the jaw has been reduced and held in place with gentle pressure, if the patient's mouth remains closed and their muscles are still tense, then apply a compress of warm wax and oil to the affected area, and bind it in place with soft bandages to provide support and promote healing.
Have the patient lie on their back with a pillow under their head and neck, positioned between two supports to keep it straight and prevent further injury; do not force them to chew any food until their jaw has healed completely, instead providing soft or chopped food that can be easily consumed without causing pain or discomfort.
Provide the patient with soft foods and drinks that do not require much chewing or effort, and encourage them to rest their jaw as much as possible until it has healed completely.
If it is difficult to reduce both jaws when they are dislocated and have not returned to their proper positions, then the patient may experience fever and constant thirst, as well as abdominal pain and frequent vomiting of clear fluid.
When these symptoms occur, it is a sign that the patient's condition is critical and they may die within a few days if not treated promptly.
Capital twenty-five. (This capital number follows the previous one without any interruption or change in topic.)
On the reduction of a dislocation of the collarbone and the end of the muscle. (The furcula, or "fork," refers to the clavicle or collarbone, which connects the shoulder blade to the breastbone.)
The collarbone is not typically dislocated from the side attached to the chest, but rather from the outer end where it connects with the shoulder blade; this can be determined by touch or sensation. (This suggests that a dislocation of the collarbone can cause pain and tenderness at the affected site, making it easier to diagnose.) [*latz = side
The treatment for a dislocated collarbone is for the patient to lie on their back with their arms extended out to the sides, in order to stretch and relax the affected muscles and joints. (This position can help realign the collarbone and promote healing.) [*jagua = lie And then apply gentle but firm pressure to the affected area with your hand, as this will help guide the bone back into its proper position. (By gently manipulating the collarbone and providing support, it is more likely to return to its normal alignment and heal properly.) [*loc = place
And then apply a warm compress or poultice to the affected area and hold it in place with gentle pressure, allowing the bone and muscles to relax and heal properly. (This can help reduce swelling and promote circulation, which can speed up the healing process.) [*emplastre = plaster
But if the end of the muscle is torn or separated from the bone, then it must be reattached and held in place with bandages or other medical devices as appropriate, following the same principles outlined earlier for reducing and healing dislocations. (This suggests that a severe strain or tear of the muscle can cause similar symptoms to a dislocation, and may require similar treatment methods to promote healing.) [*siec = tears
And then apply a warm compress or poultice to the affected area and hold it in place with gentle pressure, instructing the patient to rest and avoid strenuous activity until the injury has healed completely. (This can help reduce inflammation and promote healing, allowing the muscle and surrounding tissues to recover more quickly.) [*emplastre = plaster
And with this method of treatment, the end of the muscle can be reattached and held in place when it has become separated from its proper position. (By providing gentle support and promoting healing, the muscle can recover more quickly and effectively from injury.)
Capital twenty-six. (This capital number follows the previous one without any interruption or change in topic.)
On reducing a dislocation of the muscle. (This could refer to a strain, sprain, or other injury that causes the muscle to become displaced from its proper position.) [*reduccio = reduction
Be aware that there are three ways in which a muscle can become dislocated: firstly, when it is displaced from the base of the spine towards the lower body. (This suggests that a muscle injury or strain in the lower back or hips can cause similar symptoms to a dislocation, and may require similar treatment methods to promote healing.) [*titillic = tailbone
The second way in which a muscle can become dislocated is when it is displaced from the upper portion of the muscle, but this occurs infrequently and should not be confused with a dislocation at the shoulder or neck, where nerves and other structures may be affected. (This suggests that a muscle injury or strain in the shoulders or neck can cause similar symptoms to a dislocation, but may require different treatment methods depending on the specific location and severity of the injury.) [*spalla = shoulder
And most commonly, a muscle is displaced towards the lower body, especially in those with less flesh or muscle mass, where it can be more easily dislocated; but in those with more substantial muscles, it may require greater force to cause a dislocation. (This suggests that the severity of a muscle injury or strain can depend on various factors, including the location and size of the affected muscle, as well as the patient's overall health and fitness level.) [*es = is
And it is not uncommon for some people to experience a blow or fall that causes their muscle to become inflamed or swollen, leading them to believe that it is dislocated when in fact it is only bruised or strained. (This suggests that proper diagnosis and treatment of muscle injuries requires careful evaluation by a trained medical professional, in order to distinguish between different types and severities of injury.) [*percussio = blow
Therefore, it is important to first confirm that the muscle is truly dislocated before proceeding with treatment, and then take appropriate measures to reduce the dislocation and promote healing. (This may involve gentle manipulation or traction to realign the muscle, followed by immobilization or support to allow it to heal properly.) [*sproes = examine
It is known that a dislocation is present when there is tingling in the areas below; so that you can distinguish between the displaced muscle and the normal muscle, since you will find clear differences between them; and you will find at the head of the muscle a concavity below the tingling upon touching the head of the muscle just like an egg, and the patient cannot move their hand to their own ear, nor can they move it at all.
If the joint is dislocated in the foot or ankle, and you find clear evidence of this, not hidden.
And such a dislocation can be easily reduced when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
The reduction of the dislocation is performed by the practitioner raising the patient's hand to the upper parts, and gently placing it below the tingling sensation, lifting the joint with force back into its place. The practitioner raises the patient's hand and extends it outward, while gently holding the other end so that it returns lightly.
But if, despite our efforts, it does not return to its original position, and the dislocation has persisted for several days since its onset, then it is necessary for the patient to bathe in warm water and be administered a poultice that softens and relaxes just like goat's rennet, fenugreek, and melilot in water.
And let the patient be raised up on their back and place a woolen compress soaked in linseed, egg white, and rose oil under the affected area, and let the doctor place his knee on the compress to exert pressure, lifting the head of the muscle with strength, pulling the patient's hand to prevent injury to the lower parts. Let another attendant hold the patient's head to ensure that it is not injured in the lower parts, for it will soon return to its proper position.
And if you wish, reduce it in the following manner: have a man who is taller than the patient be present and stand on their side, then insert his muscle under the affected area of the patient and lift it upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, while another attendant pulls the patient's hand away from their abdomen. But if the patient is weak, then it is necessary for them to be suspended by some other means that will put weight on the affected area, causing the dislocation to return quickly.
And the dislocation can also be reduced in another way: place a long pole on the ground with a round top, similar to a mortar pestle, that is neither too thick nor too thin, and let the patient sit on it. Then, drape linen cloths over the top of the pole, and let the patient stand upright along its length, extending their hand downwards on one side, while another person pulls the patient's body forcefully from the other side, causing the joint to return quickly to its proper position.
And if the reduction is difficult for any of the reasons mentioned earlier, then use this remedy: take a pole that measures two cubits in length and four fingers in width, with a thickness adjusted according to the size of the affected area in the following manner:
And let linen strips be placed on top of the round surface to prevent the patient from being injured by the pole.
And let the patient's affected area be placed on top of the pole, with their hand or arm extended over it towards the lower end, and then tie the pole to the splint along with the arm and the end of the hand.
Let the arm be placed on a step ladder according to its width, with the hand extended downwards, and let the rest of the body be suspended from the other side, so that the joint quickly returns to its proper position.
Once the reduction has been completed in any of the aforementioned ways, it is necessary to place a woolen compress soaked with egg whites and albumen under the affected area, followed by an emplaster prepared with powdered molasses, honey, and egg white over the entire muscle, making sure that it is spread evenly. Additionally, apply gentle pressure with a bandage below the affected area with appropriate tension, then wrap the wound with bandages and secure the patient's hand to their neck, leaving it in this position for seven days without moving it.
It is necessary to restrict the patient's food intake to small amounts until the affected limb feels better, as this will promote faster healing.
And let the patient's diet be gradually increased after seven or five days or when exercise is possible, and if it feels firm and not soft, then it is already healed.
But if the joint is dislocated frequently due to excess moisture or other causes, then it is necessary to administer cauterization three times in that area, as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cauterization.
If all of the above steps are taken and yet after seven days, the bandages have loosened and the joint has not healed, if the plaster and pressure have been applied multiple times without success, and if the patient is unable to raise their arm upwards, then it should be known that the nerves at the head of the muscle have been severed, stretched, or damaged. It should also be understood that the joint will never return to its proper position.
The reduction of a dislocation in the foot or breast area, or any other location on the backside, is done by applying force and extension with hands until it returns to its proper position.
And let the other pressure be applied there, and take care of it until it is healed.
And if there is severe heaviness in the limb and delayed movement during healing, then let the patient take frequent baths until the heaviness is relieved and they return to their natural state.
Chapter twenty-seven.
Chapter twenty-seven: On the treatment of hip dislocation.
It is important to know that the hip joint is difficult to dislocate and also challenging to reduce back into its proper position. Dislocation can occur in any direction, but it is most common for it to happen from the front to the back. The dislocation is not concealed, as it causes a noticeable deformity or bulge in the affected area depending on how it is displaced. When attempting to adjust the dislocated hip, it will be clear that the joint is concave and cannot bend or touch its corresponding muscle due to the misalignment.
Therefore, it is essential to treat the dislocation as soon as possible, before it develops into an abscess, which would make reduction difficult and healing unlikely. This is especially true for dislocations that occur in the back, which are more severe than other types of dislocations, cause significant pain, and often lead to death if left untreated.
The restoration of a dislocated hip that is reducible involves extending the patient's hand with two fingers, expanding their arms, and placing the hands of the physician on top of the hip joint and below it. The physician then pushes the joint back into its proper position using their fingertips or the edge of their palm until it returns to its original location.
But if the dislocation is in front, then it should be corrected by bending the patient's hand towards their own hand until they strike the hip with the edge of their palm.
But if the dislocation does not respond to reduction, then administer strong and forceful extension.
And let two attendants extend the patient's arms, and hold it firmly in place to prevent any relapse during extension.
And let the arms be wrapped around the entire area, after they have been covered with long folded cloth or bandages.
And when the physician touches the joint with their hand, anoint it with some oil to facilitate lubrication and ease of movement. Then push the joint vigorously until it returns to its proper position.
After reducing the dislocation, it is necessary to apply a poultice that has both styptic and exsiccating properties with egg white, and securely tie it in place with appropriate tension. The arm should be suspended from the neck, and left alone for several days.
And once the dislocation has healed, remove the bandages and let it be.
And if you see that the joint is not strengthening, then you should reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it on for several days until it dries out; and then unwrap it.
But if the reduction of the joint causes discomfort, and the person is in motion, then administer moist heat in the form of baths and gentle friction, as well as compression, until they are relieved; or place a fatty cushion on the affected joint, that is, a thick cushion; and then bind it, leaving it on the bone day and night. Then place that (person) in a bath; and when they are dry, you should then gently rub the joint with tempered friction, and then reapply the warm compress to the affected area, once, twice, and then a third time.[/ Corruption has already spread to the nail bed before it becomes noticeable (is evident).
And if you wish, place the affected area on a damp and scarified cow's split, and rub it with butter and strengthen it; and do this several times, because it is wet and helps to restore its position.
Chapter 28. (This seems to be the end of one section or chapter, as indicated by the word "Capitol" followed by a number.)
Chapter 28: On the treatment of dislocation of the elbow, that is, the joint between the arm and the forearm. (This suggests that the text is shifting to a new topic or section, as indicated by the word "De" followed by the name of the condition being discussed.)
The elbow joint is sometimes dislocated, and reducing the dislocation is relatively easy; however, this is not the case for other joints, but still, swift action is required in reducing it at the time of dislocation before it becomes inflamed or develops an abscess. (This passage discusses the symptoms and treatment of a dislocated elbow.)
The treatment for reducing a dislocated elbow involves placing the affected person's arm on a table and instructing them to extend their arm. Then, place your hand over the back of their hand or palm near the joint and gently push it back into place. (This passage describes the actual procedure for reducing a dislocated elbow.)
However, it is important to consider whether the palm is facing towards the person's belly. In that case, have them place the back of their hand on the table for extension and reduction. If the dislocation is anterior, then the person's hand should be placed with the palm down on the table, allowing the doctor's hand to push on the dorsal side of the elbow joint. (This passage provides additional instructions based on the orientation of the dislocated elbow.)
And if it returns quickly, that is good; but if not, then strengthen it with a yielding plaster to prevent inflammation and leave it alone. Do not repeat this, as it may interfere with the reduction of the swelling in a few days. (This passage provides additional advice on what to do after reducing a dislocated elbow.)
However, if the joint remains unstable due to its natural crookedness or if the patient does not feel any improvement, but rather a weakness in their arm without any apparent cause, then know that the nerves may be trapped or compressed. In this case, use a cautery to strengthen and improve blood flow around the affected area, which will help alleviate the compression on the nerves.
When the elbow joint has been successfully reduced, place a plaster on it as recommended and leave it in place for 5 days, allowing it to heal and become stable. After that, remove the bandage and begin exercising the arm again to restore its normal function.
But if the joint becomes stiff and there is discomfort or pain, gently apply warm water and gentle massage several times until the pain subsides.
Chapter 29. (This indicates that a new topic or section is beginning.)
Chapter 29: On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
Fingers are often dislocated at various points. (This statement suggests that finger dislocations can occur at different locations along the finger, such as the joints between the phalanges or at the base of the finger near the metacarpal bones.)
And when a finger is dislocated at the base of the palm or on the belly of the finger, you should straighten it and gently push the dislocation back into place with your fingers until it returns to its normal position. (This passage describes how to treat a dislocation at the base of the finger, near the palm.) [
And then support the head of the finger and hold it up at the site of dislocation, leaving it in place for two days. (This passage describes what to do after reducing the dislocation, which is to immobilize the finger for a short period to allow it to heal.)
And then suspend it (the finger) and extend it until it is straightened in its proper position by that day. This suggests that the immobilization period may vary depending on the severity of the injury, but the goal is to restore the finger to its normal alignment as soon as possible.
And when it gets better, bind it (the finger) as described in the narrative, and do not stop unwrapping it during the day and exercising with movement, and bind it again at night; and do this for several days until it becomes straight. This passage suggests that after the immobilization period, the patient should gradually begin to move the finger and use it normally, while also applying a bandage or dressing at night to provide support and prevent re-injury. The process of unwrapping and rewrapping the dressing during the day may help promote healing and reduce swelling.
And do the same thing if it is dislocated at the palm of the hand, and bind it to that area and perform the first operation until it is healed. This passage suggests that the treatment for a dislocation at the base of the hand may be similar to that of a finger dislocation, with immobilization and gentle exercise being important parts of the healing process. The use of a bandage or dressing may help support the injured area and prevent further damage. As with any injury, it is important to seek medical attention from a qualified healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts (of the body). This passage suggests that the same principles of immobilization, gentle exercise, and supportive dressing can be applied to other types of dislocations as well. It is important to seek medical attention from a qualified healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment, as the specific techniques and methods used may vary depending on the location and severity of the injury.
Chapter 30. (This indicates that a new topic or section is beginning.)
Chapter 30: On the treatment of dislocation of the vertebrae in the back.
When a dislocation occurs in any of the vertebrae in the back or neck and several vertebrae are displaced from their proper positions, then in that case there is no cure, for death is imminent for the patient. (This passage suggests that spinal dislocations can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.)
A sign of this is that the patient's bowel movements are involuntary and they cannot hold it in, and many times their limbs or two legs or both arms, or one of those, are weakened, or a vertebra has moved from its place, for many times vertebrae have moved and many times the removal of those is to four parts (directions).
Therefore, it has become dislocated to the back parts and is called "gelbozitation." It's unclear what specific condition or injury the text is referring to with this term, as it doesn't appear to be a recognized medical term in any of the languages it resembles. However, based on the context, it seems to describe a serious spinal dislocation that can have life-threatening consequences. It's important to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms are present.
But the treatment for it is that you should consider whether the "gelbozitation" occurred during childhood, because in that case there is no cure or complete healing for it. This suggests that some spinal injuries or conditions may be more difficult to treat if they occur at a young age and become chronic. It's important to seek medical attention for any spinal injury or condition, even if it appears to be minor or non-life-threatening, as early intervention can help prevent long-term complications.
However, for those that result from accidents or blows or similar causes, the ancients have described the methods of treatment in a lengthy discourse, which returns the most profit; but I have shortened it and omitted much of it, as little is needed for understanding, through a clearer explanation, with which I have explained and presented various instruments for that, which I will show and expand upon.
And those (spinal injuries) are not cured except for those that occur in the back properly with what I have mentioned (i.e., the method of treatment I recommended). This passage suggests that some spinal injuries or conditions may be treatable if they occur in certain areas and are addressed promptly with appropriate methods. It's important to seek medical attention for any spinal injury or condition, as the specific method of treatment will depend on individual circumstances. The author implies that he has recommended a particular method of treatment for spinal injuries, but it is not specified in this passage.
And it is that the patient should be laid out on their face on a soft cushion placed near a wall, and they should be extended with the instrument (i.e., the medical device) moistened so that the patient's chest is not injured. This passage suggests that the method of treatment recommended by the author involves positioning the patient in a specific way to ensure proper alignment and minimize risk of injury during the procedure. The use of a soft cushion and a moistened instrument may help prevent discomfort or harm to the patient. It's important to follow medical advice carefully and seek professional assistance when performing any medical procedures, especially those involving the spine.
And then place a straight staff under the patient's neck, placed on the ground near the edge of the cushion, and another staff should be placed across the patient's feet at the other end of the cushion. This passage suggests that the positioning of the patient involves the use of two staffs or rods to support the neck and feet, respectively. The first staff is positioned under the patient's neck to keep it aligned with the rest of the spine, while the second staff is placed across the patient's feet to provide additional support and stability. This type of positioning may be used to reduce the risk of further injury during the medical procedure. It's important to follow proper guidelines and seek professional assistance when performing any medical procedures, especially those involving the spine.
And the minister (i.e., the healthcare provider) should hold the staff and not be fixed in a pit; and another minister should hold the other one in that same manner. This passage suggests that two healthcare providers are involved in positioning the patient for the medical procedure, each holding a staff to provide support and stability. The use of two staffs may help ensure proper alignment and prevent further injury during the procedure. It's important to follow proper guidelines and seek professional assistance when performing any medical procedures, especially those involving the spine. The text emphasizes that the healthcare providers should not be fixed in place or trapped, indicating a concern for their safety as well as the patient's.
And then wrap (the bandage) around the patient's head and tie it tightly with small knots; extend the end of the bandage to the staff that is near the patient's head, and tie it to the staff; then strengthen the other bandage around the patient's hips and knees, and around their thighs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other staff that is near the patient's feet. This passage describes how to apply bandages to the patient's head, hips, and legs to provide support and stability during the medical procedure. The use of two staffs may help ensure proper alignment and prevent further injury. It's important to follow proper guidelines and seek professional assistance when performing any medical procedures, especially those involving the spine. The text emphasizes that the bandages should be tied tightly but not too tight, indicating a concern for the patient's comfort as well as safety.
And then each minister should extend the bandage to the part of the staff, and the two staffs and the bandages in their places where they are placed should not be dislocated, but still, they should not be fixed as I mentioned earlier. This passage reiterates the importance of proper alignment and stability during the medical procedure, emphasizing that the staffs and bandages should not be dislodged from their positions but also should not be fixed in place. It's important to follow proper guidelines and seek professional assistance when performing any medical procedures, especially those involving the spine. The text suggests that some degree of flexibility is necessary to accommodate the patient's movements and ensure their comfort and safety.
And the physician places his hands on the vertebra with strength until it returns (to its place), or that he places on it a board, and then adjusts his feet on the board until it returns. This passage suggests two methods for reducing a dislocated vertebra: one involves direct manual manipulation by the physician, who applies pressure to the affected area with their hands until the vertebra returns to its proper position. The other method involves using a board or other flat surface as a support for the patient's body weight, allowing the physician to apply traction and adjust the spine until the dislocation is corrected. Both methods require skill and expertise to perform safely and effectively, emphasizing the importance of seeking medical attention from a qualified healthcare provider when dealing with spinal injuries or conditions.
But if it does not return through this method, then take a table that is three arms' length in either its latitude or length, and carve into the wall near the patient a niche where the end of the table can fit. This passage suggests an alternative approach for reducing a dislocated vertebra when the previous methods have been unsuccessful. The text recommends using a large table that is at least three arms' length in either its latitude or length, and carving a niche into the wall near the patient to accommodate the end of the table. This may create more space for the physician to maneuver and apply traction to the spine, potentially increasing the chances of successful reduction. However, it is important to note that this method should only be attempted by trained medical professionals in a controlled setting, as improper manipulation of the spine can lead to serious injury or even death. And then place the middle of the table on the vertebra, and the physician places his feet on the other end, and pulls hard until the vertebra is constricted and returns to its place. This passage describes the final step in the alternative approach for reducing a dislocated vertebra, which involves using a large table to apply traction to the spine. The text recommends placing the middle of the table on the affected vertebra, while the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls hard until the vertebra is constricted and returns to its proper position. It is important to note that this method should only be attempted by trained medical professionals in a controlled setting, as improper manipulation of the spine can lead to serious injury or even death. The text emphasizes the need for strength and precision in executing this technique, indicating the complexity and risk involved.
And if you want, open further the wound that has been turned over with your hand; and this means that you place two sticks in the ground on both sides of the patient's head, the length of which should be one arm's length, and the distance between each stick should be one palm's width. Also, make a hole in the middle of each stick, and securely fasten each one to the ground so that they do not move.
And place a round stick in the wound, and have it extend through both holes of the two sticks.
And at the end of it is a hole through which the stick has been formed, one palm's length with a hole in it, and the same applies to the other two sticks.
And then tighten the ligaments that you have placed on the patient's feet in the hole near their head, and the ligaments that you have placed on their thighs in the wound near their legs.
And then each wound should be held open by a minister who twists the wound with his hand and applies a bandage to the spine as we have said.
And after the spine has been straightened and the area has been bandaged, it is necessary to apply a dry plaster of egg white and albumen, and a piece of cloth; place a wooden board over the plaster, with a width of three fingers or thereabouts, and a length that covers the affected area, placed on top of the spine.
And then it should be bound with the ligament that we mentioned, and the patient should consume light nourishment until they are healed.
And if any residual pain remains in the affected area at the end of the healing process, then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and clean with long-term use of the tablets we recommended; and a lead plate has already been applied to the area.
And sometimes it happens that there is pain in the lower part of the spine, which is caused by dislocation; and this bone is so weak that it should not be further pressed with this medicine because it would easily cause death.
Chapter thirty-one.
Chapter thirty-one: On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the joint of the hip and the joint of the muscle do not become swollen but are only dislocated, and this does not happen as it does with other small joints with slight movement and concavity.
And the hip joint can be dislocated in four ways: either towards the inside, outside, front or back.
And it is most commonly dislocated towards the inside, and less frequently at the front or back.
And a sign of dislocation towards the inside is that when you place the healthy leg next to the affected leg of the patient, the latter appears longer and more prominent than the former, and the patient is unable to bend their knee, and it is the same area where the inflammation or "caut" has appeared as a sign of an abscess or boil, indicating that the head of the thigh bone has shifted inward.
And the sign of one who has dislocation towards the outside is that their symptoms are the opposite of those mentioned above.
And the sign of one who has dislocation towards the front is that they can extend their leg fully, but experience pain when trying to bend it, and if they attempt to walk they are unable to do so and experience pain in the front part of their hip, their urine is retained and there is swelling, and the patient should be made to lie on their back.
And the sign of one who has dislocation towards the back is that they cannot extend their knee or bend it forward beyond a certain point, and their thigh appears shorter than the other leg, their hip joint feels soft and the head of the thigh bone has shifted to this location.
However, in the treatment of this dislocation, one must consider if it is old and chronic, in which case one should not administer reduction but let it heal on its own without any further manipulation. And so, there is no need for any pressure to be applied in such a case.
But in the case of a recent dislocation that is one of the four types mentioned earlier, one must return the joint to its place by extending it outwards and inwards, and then move it to the right and left as necessary, because it will easily return to its proper position without requiring any further treatment.
But if it does not return to its proper position in this manner, then one must prepare a strong assistant who can extend the patient's leg downwards or upwards with their hands, or use a ligament that is tied around the leg above the knee. Another assistant should extend their hand over the patient's thigh and press their fingers downwards to locate the head of the thigh bone. A third assistant should then pull strongly on the ligament tied around the thigh bone, while a fourth assistant keeps the other end of the ligament taut.
And the extension of the leg should be done by pulling it towards the groin and the pelvic bone or towards the spine.
And this extension should be done in one movement, so that the patient is raised off the ground with their body hanging freely.
This method of extension applies to all four types of dislocations.
And if the dislocation returns with the method we described, then that is good. But if not, then it is necessary for each type of dislocation to follow its specific treatment as I will explain.
In the specific treatment for a dislocation towards the inside, the patient should lie on their side with the affected leg facing upwards. The assistant should then place ligaments over the hip bone in the area between the head of the thigh bone and the inflammation or swelling that appears below the knee. Then, they should pull on the ligament above the groin towards the highest point of the pelvic bone.
And another strong assistant should hold the patient's arms, and then press hard on the affected side of the hip while forcefully extending the leg outwards. This will cause the head of the thigh bone to return to its proper position.
And this type of dislocation is easier to treat and reduce compared to the other types.
However, if the patient resists and refuses to cooperate with this type of treatment, then both their legs should be tied together firmly with a ligament, above their ankles and knees.
And let each ligament be four fingers wide, and the affected leg should be extended more than the healthy one by two fingers width.
And let the patient be suspended by their head over the stick and placed in a high position, with a distance of two arm lengths between them and the ground.
And let a strong young man be commanded to push down on the head of the thigh bone with great force, while another young person holds the patient's head and pushes it upwards. This will cause the joint to quickly return to its proper position.
However, in the specific treatment for a dislocation towards the outside, the patient should lie on their stomach as previously recommended. Then, ligaments should be placed firmly over the affected leg and above the foot to hold it in place.
And let two sticks be placed under the patient, one under their feet and the other near their head. Also, place a stick of appropriate size between the patient's buttocks to prevent the discomfort caused by the stick being in contact with their private parts, while also allowing for proper extension of the leg towards the back.
And let each assistant extend their respective area and the doctor use his hand to guide the reduction as per medical art.
And when the dislocation is towards the front, then the leg should be extended slightly and placed on a mound as described earlier. The doctor should place the palm of their right hand over the affected knee and use their left hand to pull the leg downwards at the calf muscle to extend it towards the back of the knee.
And if the dislocation is towards the back, then the patient should not be extended backwards and instead elevated off the ground with a firm support beneath them, similar to the procedure for dislocations of the hip joint towards the outside as mentioned earlier. The ligaments should be pulled firmly in the manner described without delay.
And it is necessary to apply pressure on the affected joint with a board.
Therefore, when the reduction is performed according to the requirement and there is no obstruction in the joint as evidenced by the patient being able to extend both legs and not resisting or showing signs of discomfort. And if the patient can move their leg freely without pain, then it means that the limb has been properly repositioned. Then one should adjust the thighs, apply a plaster and bandage firmly around the hip joint making sure not to injure it in any way. The patient should rest for three to four days.
And then undo the bandage and plaster, compare one leg with the other to ensure they are of equal length and gait is normal.
Therefore, if you see that everything is normal and the legs are equal, then it indicates that the dislocation has been successfully reduced, and one can allow the patient to move around freely.
And if you notice any signs of swelling or inflammation, reapply the bandage and plaster, immobilize the limb in its original position, and allow it to heal for three days.
And then untie it (him/her), and make him/her delay in walking for some days, until he/she is strengthened.

On the cure for dislocation of the thumb.
The thumb is dislocated in three ways: it can be dislocated at the outer parts, at the inner parts, and at the lower parts more than at the back parts; but it is not dislocated at the front parts.
And the sign of thumb dislocation is that you command the patient to bend their leg on the thigh; then you will know that the thumb is dislocated.
And the restoration of all the ways of it (the thumb) is that you make the patient sit upright, so that they can stretch their leg, if possible; hold your fingers to his face, and place his foot between yours; then press the thumb with both your palms, holding it firmly between your fingers and applying force on it with strength, while another servant extends the patient's leg until the thumb returns to its place.
And the sign of restoration of it (the thumb) is that its leg adheres to the thigh without laborious effort.
And then apply a plaster on it and make the leg adhere to the thigh, and then bind that with bandages for three days or four, and then loosen those.
And the patient should not use (walk on) it for several days, until it is healed and strengthened.
But if reducing it (the dislocation) is impossible for you, then administer vigorous extension with ligaments as described in the previous narrative on hip cure.
Chapter 33.
On the cure for dislocation of the ankle.
The ankle can sometimes be sprained due to minor twisting, and other times it becomes dislocated according to its natural alignment, and the dislocation of it (the ankle) can occur either inwardly or outwardly.
And the sign of the dislocation of it (the ankle) is that sometimes the ankle appears to be swollen towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the cure for a sprain (remocio) of it (the ankle) is a simple reduction, and is that it should be stretched with ease using the hands and bandaged until it returns to its normal position.
But in the cure for it (the ankle) when it is dislocated according to its natural alignment, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright and have a strong and capable servant hold the affected part from behind at the middle of their backside.
And then you place your right hand under the patient's heel of the upper part, and with your left hand below the foot on the ankle bone.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and press down on it twice with your left hand, and extend it (the ankle) with your left hand; and push the heel of the foot with your right hand towards the thigh without laborious effort.
And do so twice as we have stated.
And then bend the toes of the foot towards the inner side of the leg, and you are at the ankle.
Therefore, if it returns to one side or the other in this manner, and if you see the foot turning blue, that is good; but if not, then repeat the procedure, because it will eventually return (to its proper position).
But if it is forbidden for you to reduce it with that which we have recommended, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, place a rolled-up cloth firmly on the ground beneath them, and let it be between their thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth around them so as not to harm the patient.
And then let the attendant hold the patient's thighs, and let another attendant stretch out the foot with their hands or use a lever that lies on top of the leg of the bed; and let each attendant pull in the opposite direction of their part, and let the roll be extended between the patient's thighs, holding it there so that the patient's body does not move downwards due to the extension.
And then the doctor turns the dislocation with their hands, and let another attendant hold the healthy thigh downwards, because the dislocation returns easily.
And so when the dislocation returns and you are satisfied with the reduction, then apply a plaster and wrap it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg with a strong bandage.
And it is necessary that you be careful or avoid the nerves which are located behind on the heel, so that the bandage over that area is not too tight and does not harm it greatly.
And then leave it for two days or three; and if the bandage becomes soft, remove it.
And then unwrap it on the third day or the fourth, and forbid the patient from walking for 40 days. But if it is necessary for them to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be re-dislocated and become corrupt, and in such a case it cannot be cured.
And if a boil appears near it, then it is necessary for you to administer to the abscess in accordance with what we have described earlier in our narrative, at a place of incision and application, until it has matured.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocation of the toes.
It is necessary that the dislocated toe be turned slightly without much effort; and this is not difficult, it is rather easy.
But if the dislocation is in one of the joints of the toe, then it is necessary for the patient to place their foot on a cushioned surface or table, and remain still as if walking.
And then you stand with your weight on it, and place your foot over the joints, and press down with force until it returns to its proper position, and make sure that it is reduced and does not protrude in that location.
And then place a board under the sole of the foot, which supports the entire foot, with two ends, and stretch it with gentle but firm tension for three days; and then unwrap it and let the foot rest from walking for many days, until it has healed and the reduction is secure.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocation that are caused by plague or fracture or some combination thereof.
When any of those causes occur and you attempt to cure it and restore the limb, many times death will result.
And so it is not appropriate to be overconfident in the treatment of such injuries, but rather a wise physician with extensive experience, who is merciful and compassionate, slow, not rash nor presumptuous; and who uses medicines at first that only soften boils, and leaves the patient to divine judgement, unless there is hope for salvation from destruction, along with alleviation of the illness, and in which some hope appears. And so make every effort to reduce it as soon as possible in the beginning of the injury, before boils develop.
And so if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that softens boils and treat the plague with drying medicaments that are appropriate for it.
And if the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and there are separate pieces in the bone, then you should treat the separation of these pieces, and do what we have said in simple illnesses of what has been previously mentioned in their locations.
And take care and avoid as much as you can the internal causes of fear, according to my previous teachings; for this is better for you in front of your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and truly healthier for your body in your time.
