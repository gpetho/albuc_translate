On the cauterization of atheyl near their removal.	On cauterization of warts after excision.	0.5735965
When you remove atheyl, heat the cautery that resembles a ray. Then insert the heated cautery into the removed atheyl, moving your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.	When you excise warts, heat a spike-shaped cautery and bring it, hot, to the site of the excised wart, and press down till the cautery reaches the mouth of the vessel whence the blood comes.	0.7727298
Do this once or twice, because if there are many atheyl, then cauterize each one as described, and then treat them with the appropriate ointments until they are healed.	Do this once or twice over. If the warts be more than one, sear each one separately as we have described ; then dress with suitable ointments till healed.	0.8118274
If you cauterize with a large cautery on the prominent part, it is more effective.	And if you burn the patient with one big cauterization over the lumbar region that will add to the effect.	0.5918044
