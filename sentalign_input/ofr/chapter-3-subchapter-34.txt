of the fingers/toes
When the fingers or toes are dislocated, they should be gently extended without force, and this is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any joint of the back of the foot, you should have the patient sit on a flat surface or on a table, upright, and place your foot on the part of the joint that protrudes, then press firmly with your foot until it returns to place; and when it is even, and nothing protrudes, place a two-headed board under the sole of the foot, then bandage it tightly, and leave it for three days, then untie it; and have him rest until he is healed.
