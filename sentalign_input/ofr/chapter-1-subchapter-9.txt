of the coldness of the head
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of air and of what we have said before;
afterwards shave the patient's head, then cauterize him in the middle of the head and on each temple, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is tolerant, and the illness is strong, make four cauteries on the spine of the back;
and leave them until the thickest part of the wound is burned, and lift your hand;
afterwards treat it until it is healed, and let the cautery, which is called "olivary," be as we have said before.
