If matter arises in the uterus from cold and humidity, so that it is prevented from conception, and its menstrual flow is corrupted and its discharge is difficult or it causes pain when it comes, then it should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we mentioned in cauterizing the bladder. And a cautery on the coccyx at the bottom of the back, or two cauteries, and the cautery iron should be nail-shaped.	When matter arises in the womb from chill or humidities and she is thereby prevented from conceiving and her menses are upset; their flow fails or, as they pass, pain accompanies them; then you must cauterize her three times around the navel, as we have mentioned in cauterization of the bladder; and once or twice in the lumbar region in the lower part of the back over the hips. The cautery should be claviform.	0.8684277
