If you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment has not been successful, then hasten to give the ill patient colocynth for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize him with the middle cautery using the olive-shaped cautery iron. Then cauterize him with the nail-shaped cautery iron, two cauterizations above the eyebrows, a little under the hair, and beware of the artery, do not sever it. And this is the image of the nail-shaped [iron].	When you have treated foetor by those methods given in its section and your treatment is unsuccessful, give the patient laxative draughts for three days; then shave his head; and burn with a median cauterization with the olivary cautery; then cauterize him twice above the eyebrows a little below the hair with a claviform cautery.
