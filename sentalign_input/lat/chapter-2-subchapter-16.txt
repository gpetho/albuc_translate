On the incision of the ungula (growth) and the fleshy prominence near the tear duct.
Chapter XVI.
You should know that the ungula (growth) presents in two forms.
Either it is fibrous, resembling hard, thin tissue.
Or it is non-fibrous, similar to a white, frozen moisture, which, when touched with an instrument or hook, breaks off and does not hold the hook.
Both types typically begin at the larger tear duct and gradually extend until they cover the vision, blocking light and eye movement.
The procedure for incising it is to have the patient rest their head on your lap.
Then, open their eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Next, grasp the growth with a hook that has a slight curve, and lift it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert a strong thread made of horsehair, ox, or cow hair. Bend the tip of the needle slightly, then embed it in the center of the ungula. Push the needle through the ungula, then secure the thread around it and stretch it upwards. Use the thread to scrape along the side of the ungula nearest to the pupil, as though you were sawing it with the thread until reaching its end.
Next, cut away the remainder near the tear duct’s root using a fine spatula or small scissors, preserving the natural flesh around the tear duct to prevent a continuous flow of tears.
Sometimes the ungula can be extended with only the hook or the thread, as previously described.
Then, scrape it off gently with a soft spatula, shaped as described.
Be careful not to let the spatula touch the corneal layer, as it could rupture and puncture the pupil.
After the incision, apply crushed salt or a solution made from ziniar (possibly a type of mineral or medicinal compound) to the eye, and leave it until the next day.
Then treat it with the appropriate remedies until it heals.
If the ungula is non-fibrous and neither the needle nor the hook can hold onto it, this type is often treated with medicines and heals as described previously.
If you wish to cut it, open the patient’s eye and take a fine, smooth spatula with a slight edge, shaped as indicated.
Gently shave off the ungula from the top with precise scraping.
If you observe that the ungula is thinning and fragmenting, and the scraping is effective, then apply a few drops of your solution made from ziniar or red sief, or crushed salt, and cover the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure on it until the entire ungula is removed.
Unless you are faced with a warm abscess in the eye; in that case, leave the ungula alone and treat the abscess until it heals.
Then repeat the procedure with the scraping until it heals.
If the fleshy prominence near the tear duct causes significant discomfort in the eye, lift it with a hook and cut away a portion of it, but avoid excessive cutting to prevent continuous tearing.
Then apply red sief or a ziniar-based solution to the tear duct until it heals.
