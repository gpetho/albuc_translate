Chapter Sixteen:
On the Cauterization of the Eyelid When Hairs Grow Inward and Hurt the Eye.
When the hairs of the eye grow inward and hurt the eye, cauterization can be done in two ways: either with fire or with a caustic medicine.
If using fire, instruct the patient beforehand to let their hairs grow long and straight; and if it hurts them at the root, bind their eyes with a bandage so that they are not hurt until the hairs have grown.
When the hairs have grown long and straight, place the patient's head on your knee, and mark the eyelid with a marking rod in the shape of a myrtle leaf, starting the mark near the hairs.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or ptilli mucilage over the eye.
Then heat the cautery, which has this shape.
Then cauterize over the marked figure bit by bit, many times, until the surface of the skin, marked like a myrtle leaf, is properly burned.
A sign of the success of your work is when you see the eyelid is contracted and the hairs are elevated away from the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days, and then apply cotton soaked in butter until the scab is removed.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if the condition returns due to the hairs at their root and the eyelid is softened, cauterize it again as you did the first time.
If the hairs are on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it is raised to its natural position and straightened so that the hairs do not hurt the eye.
The cauterization with caustic medicine involves instructing the patient to let the hairs grow long and straight, then preparing a piece of cloth in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take known soap and an ounce of quicklime, mix them well, and do this quickly so it does not cool. Then spread the mixture on the cloth shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or both eyes; place cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and position the patient's head on your knee.
Press the medicine slightly, but do not move it until the patient feels a biting sensation from the medicine, as if it were fire.
When the patient feels the biting sensation, remove the medicine and rub the area with your finger; when the sensation stops, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; then see if the eyelid is already raised as it would be by fire or incision, and if not, apply the medicine again on the area where it was not effective, until the operation is complete and the eye is contracted.
Then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn scab is removed, and treat it with ointment until healed.
You must be vigilant that no medicine falls into the eye during the operation, and if the eyelid softens again and the hairs cause pain, repeat the medicine on the softened area of the eyelid as you did initially, and treat it until it is healed.
This is the form of the myrtle leaf.
Know that human eyes vary in size, so your treatment should be adjusted accordingly.
The proper method will not be hidden from anyone who studies this art.
