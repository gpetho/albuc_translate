of the body of tears
When the tears of the eyes are long-standing and habitual and are on the veins, or near the arteries that are visible on the outside of the head; and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make the cautery that I mentioned at the beginning of the water descending to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or cauterizations below the two bones; and if there is more need, cauterize it carefully above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
