On the method of cauterizing in cases of chronic apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When apoplexy has become chronic, and you treat it as we have described, and your treatment is ineffective, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each corner of his head, a cautery in the middle of the head as we have discussed, and a cautery at the back of the head, as previously outlined. The method for these cauteries should follow the previously described approach.
Additionally, apply a cautery over the pit of the stomach, which is the last step in this method.
Then treat the cauterized areas following the earlier instructions.
