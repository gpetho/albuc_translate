On the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.	On incising a tumour of the liver with the cautery.	0.6479744
When an abscess occurs and you wish to know if it is in the liver's flesh or its covering: if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient suffers dull pain and heaviness; if in the liver's covering, there is sharp, intense pain; and you see that its treatment has wearied the physicians.	When there is an abscess in the liver and you are anxious to know if the tumour is in the body of the liver or in its capsule: if it is in the substance of the liver, the patient will be suffering from a feeling of heaviness and no very acute pain. But if it is in the capsule of the liver there will be the sharpest intensity of pain and you will see that it has baffled the doctors.	0.8668731
Thus, the patient should lie on his back. Then mark the site of the abscess with ink, and heat a cautery shaped like a ray. And this is its shape. Cauterize with it once, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the membrane, until all discharge is released; then treat it with the abscess remedy until healed.	Then the patient should lie back on his neck; then mark the place of the swelling with ink. Then heat the cautery in the fire, this being the cautery resembling a probe, of this form, and with that make one cauterization till the whole thickness of the skin is burnt through, finishing up at the capsule so that all the purulent matter comes out. Then apply the treatment for wounds.	0.918367
And this type of cautery should not be used except by one experienced in the art of medicine and who has often encountered such illnesses; only then should he dare this procedure.	This kind of cauterization should not be employed except by one who has a long experience of the medical art and who has frequent practice at dealing with this kind of disease. Then he can undertake this kind of operation.	0.86387277
But truly, leaving it alone is, in my view, better.	But in my opinion it would be better to pass it by.	0.7195916
