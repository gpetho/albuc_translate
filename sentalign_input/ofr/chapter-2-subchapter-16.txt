of the nail of the eye
Know that the nail (pterygium) is of two kinds:
one is fibrous and resembles a hard tumor, and the other is not fibrous, but resembles a frozen white moisture, that when one touches it with iron and tries to grasp it with forceps, one cannot;
and both kinds begin near the tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover all the sight and all the light and the movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient puts his head on your lap, then opens his eyes;
and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the nail with the forceps, bending it slightly, and stretching it upwards;
then take a needle, and put in it a horsehair, or a cow hair, or an ox hair, and a strong thread;
and bend the point of the needle a little and insert it in the middle of the nail, and pierce it through with the whole needle, and tie the nail with a thread and stretch it upwards, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil and the white of the eye up to the top, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a very fine spatumile and with little force, and leave the natural flesh in the tear duct, so that the flow of tears does not become accustomed to the incision;
and sometimes the nail is stretched with the hook only, and with the thread, as we have said;
then it is scraped with the spatumile gently, which has this shape:
And be careful that the spatumile does not touch the fleshy tissue and tear it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision put a little crushed salt in the eye, and some collyrium made of litharge, and leave it until the next day;
then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sinewy, and you cannot insert the needle, and the hook cannot enter, often this type of nail is treated with medicines;
and they grow as I have explained in the section, and if you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye, and take a smooth spatumile, slightly sharp, in this shape:
And scrape the nail above subtly, and if you see that it diminishes somewhat and the root comes close, then instill in the eye a collyrium made of litharge and red collyrium and crushed salt from your mouth, and cover the eye until the next day;
then recommence the other work according to this same method, until it is completely removed.
If something is wrong with the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and treat the hot abscess first until it is healed, then recommence the work as before, until it is healed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the caruncle harms the eye greatly, then lift it with a hook, and cut a part of it and not all, so that a flow of tears doesn't come;
then instill in the eye red collyrium which is made of litharge.
