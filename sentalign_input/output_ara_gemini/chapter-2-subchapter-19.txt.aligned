Chapter nineteen on returning the feather to the nose.	CHAPTER NINETEEN. On turning a fistula into the nose.	0.7500124
Doctors call the fistula a fistula.	Doctors give the name 'fistula' to what laymen call 'a quill'.	0.8224491
If you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medication as described previously, and it does not heal, then there is no remedy for it except to incise the swelling when it ripens and extract all the moisture or pus in it until the bone is exposed.	When you have treated it with the cautery or with caustic according to the instructions given previously, and it is not healed, there is no clear method of treatment except to cut down on the tumour at its ripening and let out all the humidity or pus therein, till you reach the bone.	0.8834417
So when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument like this:	When bone is reached and you see necrosis or blackness, scrape it with an instrument like this.	0.78907156
And it is called the rough-headed one, made from Indian iron, and its head is round like a button, engraved with the engraving of a file or scalpel, a fine engraving.	It is called 'rough-head' and is made of Indian iron. Its head is round like a button but is engraved with markings finely engraved, like those of a file or a rasp.	0.81689596
You place it on the site of the corruption in the bone, then rotate it between your fingers while clenching your hand slightly until you know that the corruption has been scraped away.	Place it on the site of the diseased bone and spin it between your fingers, pressing down a little with your hand, till you are sure all the diseased bone has been scraped away.	0.7856574
And you do that repeatedly, then you dress the place with drying, astringent medicines.	Do this several times. Then let the place be dressed with stanching and styptic remedies.	0.67393124
If the place is sealed and flesh grows in it, and the pus flow stops and it remains for forty days, and it does not regenerate, nor fester, nor does anything happen to it, then know that it has healed, otherwise there is no solution except to return the fistula to the nose opening in this way, which is to expose the bone again with iron or with a sharp medicine. So, when the bone is exposed, take a branched instrument like this image:	And if the place heals and flesh is generated there and the flow of sanies is stayed and there is no return after leaving for forty days, and there is no swelling, and nothing emerges, you may know it is perfectly healed. But if not, there is no other means for it but to turn the fistula into the cavity of the nose, in this style, namely, that you lay bare the bone a second time, either by an instrument or by caustic; and when the bone is uncovered, then take a drill like this.	0.8888581
The tip of the instrument should be triangular, and its shaft conical, brought to a point, as you see.	Its extremity, which is of iron, should be triangular; and its wooden handle should be conical in shape, and, as you see, tapering to the extremity.	0.7508797
Then place it on the bone itself, and this should be near the suture, and keep your hand a little away from the eye. Then turn your hand with the instrument until the bone is pierced, and the patient feels it by finding air coming out of it when he holds his hand over his nose.	Then put it to the bone itself near the canthus; but keep your hand a little away from the eye; then with your hand rotate the drill till the bone is perforated; and the patient will have the sensation of this, since, if he holds his hands over his nose he will find the breath coming out through the hole.	0.9125437
Then at this point, treat the area with astringent and drying medications, as I have taught you.	And then dress the place with styptic and stanching remedies as I have taught you.	0.76851785
So when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter that was flowing outwards will return to the nose, and this will be easier for the patient, God willing.	And when the flesh begins to grow and the place gets hard, the matter which before was coming outward will be turned into the nose; and this will be easier for the patient.	0.8350986
