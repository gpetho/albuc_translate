Ayssa begins speaking with us (or addresses those present). You have completed this medical book for me, which I hold as the pinnacle of science in medicine due to your diligence and mastery over it; through its discussions, expositions, and declarations. It has become clear that you possess deep knowledge about our subject matter today's surgery topic within these pages.
When the operation is restrained in our region and at all times privately, as long as I study this science of yours, and observe what you have shown me; until only small descriptions remain from ancient texts freely available to us, which I will modify these into errors we know about nowads—closed intents are your conclusions herein, lengthened force is applied in art.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And I have seen that you need life according to this treatise in its second part of exposure and declaration, as well as for abbreviation; therefore, it is necessary for the form of cautery tools and other instruments used with them during preparation."
May be the reason why no skilled artisan dares to operate on my hand here in our time, for medicine is long and requiring further practice in anatomical science that Guillia has knowledge of the limbs' proper movements and forms; also knowing their joint connections and separations (articulations), as well as bones, nerves, tendons, names of these parts, circulatory pulses and rests, locations for dissection—all this.

May we already have discussed this with him; those who do not know what has been told to them will fall into error and serve death if they witness such things, as these are formed in the science of it and taken from that very same knowledge and practice.
Here is the line by line translation of the source sentence: "And a physician with leaf and expertise has pierced an escorbida in the woman'thy chest, puncturing some arteries therein so that great blood flows where she died within her.
Here comes another doctor who prescribes the ingestion of a stone from a home that had processed in his state; this stone is large and enters into it (the bladder), whereby that same home dies on the third day.
And you have already called for that one to be removed here where it will die due to the greatness of the stone and because of how the bile is positioned there undernethy.

Indeed at that time there was confirmed decay in the limb, so it could not be restrained from spreading further within where the malady is situated.
And here comes another doctor who pierced an abscess, and it ulcerated for several days until the wickedness of him has been seen by his lordship.
The cause is that the head suffers from melancholistic humors excessively, not because it comes to be in total but due to which member has been held throughout.

"Begin with the division of the book, and firstly consider Part One." This suggests that one should start reading or studying a specific portion—presumably where an author has divided their work into sections for easier comprehension "The first ordered chapter within the section for feet involves instruments and tools of cautery, as well as what is required in their use." This indicates that there's a particular instructional or explanatory segment at this point which presumably details certain medical procedures related to treating conditions like gout by using various implements specifically designed for healing purposes. These might include items such as surgical tools used with cauterization, an ancient method of wound treatment and pain relief that was commonly pract

Here they are instructed to move on from Part One (which discusses chap "The second chapter dealing with incision and perforation instruments; cupping (ventosas); draining techniques for pus or effusion collecting in those areas; extraction of herbs and simples, all arranged according to the forms of these tools." This implies that within this segment there is detailed information on various medical devices used during surgical procedures such as making cuts into tissues (incision) or creating small holes (perforation), using suctions like cupping for drawing out fluids from lesions, and extracting medicinal herbs. Each of these items' purposes are

When you assess the quality of that cautery and its contents, and in which part it is forbidden to use a cautery:
Therefore say that the language of cauterization and its obscurity is long and complex, requiring subtlety in science; they speak much about it extensively, disagreeing with each other, and for me enough is a small part of their discussions, as I am weary from prolonged discourse.
And thus it is said that the use of cautery comforts all parts universally, except for two kinds of matter (the ones at the tail), which are part of its material.
In the complexity of the dry and cracked matter; those who use cautery find it beneficial for that area, while others apply what is contrary to that, which is not suitable in a condition characterized by quality and dryness—herein lies the nature of the focus itself being both. The necessity arises because such treatment with water (which has been cooled and dried) suits this type of malady due to its inherent characteristics of quality and dryness, hence it is appropriate for treating ailed tailbone that requires moistening and healing through applied water.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "E dicta ille qui dicet contraria facie dixerentia alta in totam maladia caducia et secca quae findimus canis, quand comparabit corpus hominum cum humiditatibus loco fovei; transmutatur corpore hominis frigorem.
Through that speech of his, I have already experienced some relief for myself at times.
Even though healing occurs over that which has already been exposed and exercised in the exercise of cautery instruments today, understanding the complexity of human nature and how diseases manifest themselves within their bodies is essential; as well as recognizing the causes of these ailments and the timing of such occurrences.
May occur in other complexities as well; it is not due to fear but rather arises from the colds and damp humors that doctors are agreed upon concerning these, without resorting to bleeding within them for treatment.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And since you know how healing is done with fire and on yourself, let it be understood that in medicine burns are used for cauterization; the heat of which only reaches the part where it has been applied as treatment, not affecting other parts of the body but causing minimal harm.
May the medicine burn reach that in their limb which is ill-lucked and hard to heal, causing it also to come into action within the affected member.
May the focus (potentially referring to a specific area of treatment), due to its sublimity and beneficial substance, does not cause excess but rather reveals itself for us through experimentation and long study in the art concerning truth about causes; thus it excuses from lengthy speech. If you have not understood my secret counsel here within this pause (a period of time or moment), then I am bound by your free will during that same interval, explaining the operation performed on limbs and expulsion through which we drive away diseases—the philosophical demonstration present in our discourse would clarify these thoughts for you.
And physicians, who understand that it is best to perform cauterizations and stops (pause) in the earliest part of the year.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "E yeu dic that cautery is convenient at all times, for when harm caused by water accumulated in it draws attention back to itself and mostly if used for pains or necessary instruments such as needles and forceps which do not suffer delays due to fear of those causing malicious evils; the greater good being more than a minor injury occurring over time.
So do not hurt your feet or legs, for they are not esteemed by the common people and physicians; as a result of this neglect, that illness which is healed through cauterization cannot be fully resolved, and its consequences continue to persist.
E the cause is not due to excess water where discomfort arises, and cauterys are only in a medical place that changes the complexity and removes the dampness which causes pain.
Even so, excessive use of caustics in medicine due to the patient'thy vitality and extent of their operation should be avoided.
It is possible that his illness may return at some time in the future according to the complexity of the humors and the location of his illness; furthermore, what has been prepared on its body's carriage for excess superfluity therein, which he acquired through foodstuffs and likenesses of those causes. If medications have already been administered in this manner, it may prevent recurrence as a latent disease within small surplus quantities or moisture; but if so, pain could return locally on the feet where treatment has occurred with cautery for toothache and similar conditions.
Even the common speech may be considered as medicine'se tools, and it is not through these that we gain understanding in them or believe they are healed by either medical knowledge nor any other cause related to their treatment with such instruments.
The cause is contrary to water; I understand that the last remedy of medicine applied in some diseases only provides temporary relief and it' extrinsic application by a healer addresses the root cause directly on the day when such applies this treatment, providing sustainable solution: Here comes the first source sentence to translate:

The cauterization will confer the wetness and cold upon the accident's wound that gives rise to it; this is caused by excessive movement of room air (possibly referring to draft or breeze), repeatedly from head to limbs, prolonged periods lying down, causing pain in teeth and gums. It also relates universally to all illnesses resulting from cold exposure such as paralysis when soaked with moisture, hardening of the body (potentially referring to rheumatism), convulsions akin to apoplexy, or resemblance in these conditions; and generally speaking affects anyone experiencing sickness due to chill.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: initially command the humour to be expelled through medicine draining from the head over three or four days, depending on how much the patient' extrudates and their habit.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:

Return your hand to the location and look there; if you discover any quantity of bone from the skull, bring it along with the amount of metal ascribed by errors (impurities), then raise your hand again towards that place, using either one or another piece depending on its coldness. If so, observe what is visible in the bone at the location mentioned before; this could be seen due to exposure when you touched it earlier with a hot iron, as previously indicated by me (the doctor).
Return (bring back) a small amount of salt and dissolve that over the location, letting it do so for three days.
Return your pause over him at his joint in place where the skin of the focus has been crushed, and apply it there so that what was torn away remains fixed. Return care for the location where there is four-drug medicine within that shall be healed.
And when the patient is unbidden and their legs are bound with rope, so that it becomes better and more conducive to healing.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And those who have a burning pain inside their body, they are both having caustic applied within the bone and withholding some cautery therein until it heals any portion of the cavity that has been injured.
Return its moisture that is within it, and return its cure as well.
And others bring the lancets needed to enter into the bone deeply within it until they reach where the hard bone is inside and this forms piercing small punctures.

And if it has been out for a long time and is cured within that period when it becomes solidified.

When the headache is chronic and long-lasting within the abdomen, using knives and hooks as well as scalpels and forceps—and mainly if it has already been treated with a burning instrument that records its cause without further detrition; moreover consider whether there's excessive bone in the nature of this condition. It does not typically involve grave dysfunction, thus treat another cautery on those affected as necessary to address these causes promptly and effectively. Return that over the patient's head above where the navel is cut, for it will be used as an internal caustic while cutting the belly button (navel). Cut the rib and reveal the bone quantity we've noted and sear it with a cauterizing instrument at the back part of the neck where it is being called upon—and that place in which bellows are used for heating air or fire, respectively. And press your hand firmly on it, so that you do not discover the bone undernethyre, as this causes great pain different from the pains of other cautery methods for the head.
Here you direct the cautery in its place, whereby if this very same cautery treats those corns on the head and back under subtle caution that it applies to the spot beneath the head for treatment – This is how things are done here.

When you treat the emigrant and refer to what has been said before about their healing, or discussing the divisions of illnesses without proper care, there are consequences—specifically where treatment with fire for wounds within the body is not sufficient compared to initial medical therapy or specialized cauterization. Here you signal over the location associated with prolonged pain along a long line that denotes their source; and restrain your hand inside during intervals when pouring water through arrows, reaching into where they are located—presumably within the chest cavity as suggested by "os" (which translates to 'lungs' or other relevant organs in this context).
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuous movement of the jaw that needs chewing, and prevent grinding or dislocation of the joint causing pain therein, as well as avoiding spasm development.

Cauteriza the pains of arthritis." Here, it appears that they are suggesting treatment for joint pain through some form of heat application or burning
When the arthritis causes pain due to blockages and it is about these healing actions I mentioned earlier; this one uses caustic agents for treatment. This is what has been applied here as a means of puncture." Here, they are describing an old method wherein some sort of needle or instrument was used in combination with substances that cause irritation (likely the 'cautery' mentioned previously) to alleviate arthritic pain. The specifics about what this cauterizing agent is and how exactly it acts on blockages would be based more explicitly stated within a full passage of such text, but from these lines we understand that there was an application involving some form of localized treatment aimed at relieving the symptoms associated with arth

Cauterize of torture is not so much the treatment itself but rather through spices that come in via fumigation." This line implies a traditional or historical approach to healing where using certain beneficial properties from spices, possibly when smoke them for therapeutic effects (fumigated), could be part of treating various illnesses. The context suggests this method was considered within the broader medical practices aimed at addressing symptoms through specific

When you treat that spice of torture for wounds and purgation, it is not appropriate to accompany your cauterization: the first (one) must be a gold fleece; secondly, use small drops from its temple; thirdly, apply moistened lips." This line suggests specific items or substances—a golden cloth ('golden fleece'), possibly representing purity or value in healing terms; tiny amounts taken directly (or 'moisten') from the body part associated with spiritual essence (the head/temple); and wetting one's lips, potentially to apply these items delicately. These details guide how certain objects are used during a cauterization procedure aimed at curing wounds or expelling pus ('purgation'), emphasizing respectful handling of the elements involved in healing according to medieval medical principles. The context implies an intertwining of spiritual and practical considerations within this therapeutic process, as well as a focus on purity (gold fleece

In these spots, perform two forms of heat treatment – one in front and another behind (referring to methods applied on different parts or aspects for healing), with applications occurrs as both a cauterization method using fire/heat within vessels' areas inside the body headward region, and also at locations corresponding to skull bones.

Using the lancet for bleeding from the patient's eyes when their hair turns into particles and pinching the patient with tweezers (the word "puncho" is likely referring to small pincers or forceps). Here, it seems medieval practitioners were using instruments such as a sharp tool
When the hair of the patient turns into particles and you pinch them (implying that their condition has worsened or become infectious), then two kinds of treatments follow: either applying cautery, which means using heat to burn out pus as a treatment method; or they might apply medicinal combustion. In this context, the practitioner is suggesting there are various therapeutic approaches available depending on how severe their condition has become after pinching them with tweezers due to these hair particles (akin to dandruff).
If I use cautery on them (presumably referring to the area being treated with heat), commanding dung or whatever they put in their mouths that makes their hair fall out, inside where these things are prolonged and ingurgitated; if tweezers touch it away from my hand's movement, then I tighten those fur around them (with a bandage) so as not to let anything come through while the patient’s pelts have just emerged. In this passage, practitioners describe their use of cautery and specific ingredients that they believe cause hair shedding or loss when consumed by patients with certain symptoms—likely referring to dermatological conditions where excessive flaking occurs (akin to psoriasis). The tightening bandage is used as a precautionary measure against any new emergence of fur while the treatment process continues, suggesting an attempt at containment and control over such outward expressions.

When joint pain is caused by cold circulating humours that infiltrate each part of the body, and when this type of discomfort occurs in the feet, it was traditionally called gout according to doctors' customs at the time. (Here "Quan dolor de juncturas" translates as 'When joint pain,' indicating a symptom; "son faytas per humors fregas les quals so enfundutz," means cold circulating humours infiltrate these parts, which is an old medical concept where excess or imbalanced fluids (humors) are thought

If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed instrument (cauterization). If pains pierce into the abdomen or other joints and motions cause them, it is necessary that one perform cautery on any such painful spot using three to four pieces of this same cauterism throughout the entire body part affected by motion.
If you have the necessary cautery tools at hand, then treat that area without pressing your own fingers on it with these instruments; do so only as much as needed for lancet insertion into the vein.
If pain enters between the groin and genitals (the scrotum), then apply as directed earlier in this chapter.
If the pain is only in the feet and it calls for sweat to be drawn out, then a piercing will occur along the circuits of the feverish areas, piercing those two lines.
If there remain pains in the feet, then make a point on each joint' extrinsic to it and over every nodule and knee cap area; where your fingers rest.
If joint or muscle pain occurs during the days at the waistbands or thighs, then you will cauterize all parts of their aidgivers (assistants).

Therefore, when you intend to cauterize it (the affected area), consider if the lice are mixed and have been healed with the water we discussed in division, or not present at all herein; nor is this case expected, fearing that corruption may spread throughout the entire body of yours and your complexion. Cauterize then over the head (top of the head), near where hair begins behind the forehead; there you will find one corn each on both sides, as well as a spot between them at back or servant position—two underneilets: one here above the crown, another just below it by two pussies. And in this region too (between these points), apply cauterization twice over with equal spacing; and after doing so, consider where to place your hand for protection against potential protrusion of intestine or hernia back into cavity—return the organ/tissue to its natural position within body.
And now place the cautery inside until it enters into the bone with a slight penetration, and thus dislocate the joints so that the escape of thick vapors is removed from there; then caulk over the wound as you have indicated beforehand.
If leprosy has already spread over the thigh and appears manifestly, then cover that area with these cauterises we have in our head; apply them to the extremity of the nose, and two on each knee joint, two on both spondyls of the neck, one great for the coitus region proper, another over the shoulder blade, two above the ankles, one above any ankle present, two on each foot's toes, one on every toenail (and thus holding their hands), and apply these cauterises:

When the fever has subsided and pus begins to form within the bone as it ruptures due to inflammation, take care of this with an antidote that will also help break down meat (pulmonary concoction), two parts flour from wheat and four parts honey. Mix them together well, apply externally using poultices made from the mixture, and administer internally during these illnesses as part of their natural diet.

When treating water that has entered the ears, as indicated by Capitol VI:
Throughout all that pain in the fingers is one of four kinds: either it'se mineral ore or resembles stone - like iron and glass; or its cause comes from fluidity - similar to water vapour and mists, or creatures therein.
And when blood appears in the earlobe or seems similar to those causes that do not align with it therein, and if you see the blood then consider it as coming from some broken oil or poisoning, apply treatment for its removal, make stirring occur within the body, which is healing through purgation. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If there is not urination, then it administers the extraction of what comes out through this subtle gesture with which these things are done.
If it is a wound that cannot be stopped (forthwith), then do so immediately with removal of the matter under one or two small pinches.
And if there is not an abscess, then use an artemisian (arses) and insert the tip of the tube into the ulceration at the hollow area in between it's walls, sealing with wax and oiled liniment to ensure that only the canula protrudes. When applying pressure above the belly button for strengthened contraction, those who have been doing so continuously come back to report it.
If there is no opening in this condition (presumably for surgical intervention), then take hold of the scalpel or forceps at which they are pressed upon one thigh tightly enough, pause and place it on that extremity tip joint, enveloping carefully around where pauses. When it is necessary to introduce that into the hollow of the auricle for ease and remove the ear from moistness, do so accordingly.
And if it is the cause of all that we have discussed so far, then take action immediately to apply caution or restrain such an inflammation attack with spasmodic contraction.

The patient then inserts one stone from this assembly into their wound and jumps on top of that particular piece as they lie down (for treatment): simultaneously striking the overlapping stones with another pebble above therein. Therefore do not stop pouring water into the stone until all of it is absorbed.
Therefore do not stop pouring water into the stone until all of it is absorbed. And when the water has flowed into the wound and you hold one end of it, insert the other end at the earlobe and extend it inside so that the fluid from the wound is drawn out.

May it be emerged from the worm during extraction when you care for that water which we have mentioned in division and flow of distillation, but do not comfort your treatment; if so, watch over the arsehole to prevent its exposure to sunlight.
Therefore if there is any cause of worms here, extract that with gentle hands or fingers today, perhaps not at all if no such cause appears; then take a wooden catheter drawn up and inserted above this way. And insert the subtle part under the auricle (earlobe) according to the quantity that suffers melancholy; apply pressure there with forceful suction and perform gentle movements until all the worms are expelled from inside.
May you not heed my attendance, then you will be drenched in the wax of the cannula while we have been speaking; administer those which have already been refined for use against old worms and apply them within the tract of these distillations.

If you wish, take the lamp and wrap it gently around the patient's limb, placing oil or honey in the cavity of their chest (and this is within your wand), along with whatever else comes from these medicines in the canula—that is where they are held. Then position the ray beneath them and express above that which was placed there to expel outwards as quickly as possible, allowing the oil or honey poured into their chest cavity for this ailment (gout) to be pushed outward by your hand pressure.
When it is encased in the auricle (ear) and has been cut at its focus, hereby small burns are applied with fire as treatment. When you examine what causes it that which will be extracted in the fever, remember that the remedies for fever do not endure too much friction.

Thus, the consideration is whether this large-scale condition arises from within and affects all parts—and if so, it might be due to dampness (moisture). This suggests that excessive moisture in any part of their eyes could potentially contribute to a significant issue.

When in the eyes of patients, natural hairs are adjusted quickly due to illnesses like teary excess and palpebral irritation—causes leading one to touch their own eye (tactile), potentially causing damage as a result: herein lies four forms of treatment according to what is stated within this text about curing such wounds, whether through surgery with forceps; or acute medicine, which shall be explained further in the chapter on immediate measures ('capitol' for cauterization); or by means of incision and suturing understanding (presumably addressing lacerations or tears requiring precise medical attention); or using thread as appropriate.
So that you can stop the flow of bile in the liver (belly), and if it converts to left eye pain or blindness: take hold of their left pupil with your right hand, and if converted, be; otherwise insert a needle into where the sinew was attached behind the eyeball quickly from there. This should go deep within that area—specifically in the region around the eyes (where hair grows)—and pull out the thread located above it at the location of your hand on their left pupil, and convert this to light again.

Even though the figure is determined by how much eye lifting occurs, in men it has diversified among them; those who have lifted their eyelids greatly determine this condition for themselves through excessive use of these muscles around the eyes.

Return the tongue to one of the two angles of the chin and scrape off everything in its entirety; position your fingers on either side of the mouth for a thin fleece (lip/palate) or wool undernethy—wipe away saliva, removing any excess that overflows from between the lips above certain indented areas, if you wish to do so, and otherwise, it remains uncured.
And apply the bandage of the fields within three to four days, and take care of it.
If you wish, stitch up the wound and care for that which draws out fluids and constricts them, whereupon you must remove its bandage and dressing; otherwise, suturing is better than doing nothing at all in terms of healing.

Whenever the hairs are not natural and they become hard, sharp, and pungent (which could indicate trapped foreign bodies or irritants), it is necessary to gently manipulate under those points where a slight yielding occurs when touched delicately—akin to testing for softness beneath one's fingertubers. Adjust the fingers of your hand as required and employ movement that feels subtle, much like handling an eel or cautiously moving around lions in their natural habitat (metaphorically speaking). When the length of the fields amounts to the size of a handful (this phrase could be referring metapthyically to an assessment or measurement, perhaps relating
Apply another subtle cushion under the field briefly, and hold those limbs if you wish to do so (this suggests that additional padding or support is needed for a patient's legs/extremities). The text implies attentive care by applying more gentle measures where necessary.
Allow the intestine back into its place in the belly button area and ensure it's positioned under sunlight so that your work (likely referring to medical treatment) can be recognized as delicate and minor intervention; this indicates a gentle approach, possibly suggesting some form of exposure therapy or healing with natural light.
Insert the needle into the prepared area of skin that requires skillfulness to pierce and make it enter underneoption, withdrawing from beneath there once done—this could refer to a delicate procedure such as removing an obstruction or performing minor surgery with precise control over where tools are inserted. The text underscores precision in medical practice required for certain interventions.
Draw the skin back inside and insert that into alignment (likely referring to correcting misalignment or adjustments during a procedure), ensuring there are only two or three hairs—this suggests meticulous attention is being paid in possibly an abdominoplasty, where excess follicles must be removed carefully for cosmetic reasons. The phrase indicates that the ideal
Draw your hand to where it's needed underneath there, between the skin that has been stretched out and aligned within or near (the eye)—this may refer to a situation in plastic surgery when one would guide their hands for precise manipulation during an adjustment close to delicate areas like around eyes.

When the eye lid is opened (levatum palpebrum), there are contractions of the upper or lower eyelid when it contracts upwards ("quando elevatur") or downward ("ad inferius"), due to congenital weakness, obstruction, or injury.

Some flesh from the apples of arbiter grows tough, and it darkens inside where light enters—the eyes or forehead region here alluded to as 'palpebras.' One must then delicately lift these parts away (fort leu comprem) at a time before cutting with what might be suggested by the term "roza de balaustra" — possibly implying an ornate slicing tool, similar to how one would slice through fine crystal. The text seems poetic and could relate metaphorically to culinary arts or perhaps some form of traditional folk remedy involving preparation techniques for animal flesh derived from various plants (huel). However, without further context, the interpretation remains speculative as it combines elements not typically found in modern English
The operation with arbiter is such that the humble (malaute) ceases in its seat within one's bowels; and thereupon it gathers all of this meat, suitable for water intake—perhaps indicating a form of purification or digestion. One uses either forceps or cuisine to take on board what is necessary from the arbiter (and possibly refers back again to nourishment). Also herein are collected cuts of that flesh so they can reach completion within those who ingest them—meaning, all consumable parts must be prepared and gathered carefully. One should ensure nothing spoils this provider'thy bounty during its preparation or consumption (te del huel que no lesdescas aquel deves la tua operacio), implying mindfulness in the handling of what is harvested from arbiter to maintain quality throughout cooking and eating.

So when the hump does not affect his entire being and is neither damaged by clothing nor decreases in size through use; you should apply poultices that loosen phlegm, followed as appropriate with cooling measures on your chest after scarification to promote good healing. Additionally, massage oil or aloe applied along the hump helps ease discomfort and alleviate pressure from pebbles embedded in it (perhaps implying a small stone ingrown within skin). This treatment suggests using soothing substances like ointment containing ataxia and aloe for relief. Moreover, firmly rubbing or kneading over the hump with massage oil may help to relieve any additional discomfort caused by stones pressing into it. The advice given indicates a traditional approach where topical remedies are used alongside physical manipulation of body areas affected—a common practice in many cultures' healing traditions before modern medicine was widely established and standardized.

If it does not fall into its place (referring likely to something that has moved out of position), you know there is water involved.
If the descent to health has not been prepared with what we have said, then gout settles between your thighs and you must apply a gentle touch beneath these areas using soft sponge or cloth under that which is in contact with the cornea of the eyeball within the head (inside the mouth), until the illness has left.

It appears to be similar to painsts represented by such pebbles." This line indicates a medieval medical perspective where nasal conditions involving unusual growths resembling certain types of rocks (possibly referring metaphorically or literally) are termed as Polypus. The physician here is linking the presence and nature of these formations with symptoms that might cause discomfort, perhaps similar to how actual painful stones in one's nose would lead to distress. This reflects a time when medical terminology was often intertwined with everyday And of the meat that is black and yellow in hue; therefrom it follows not to have flesh like a lion."

May cover when the thigh is formed to eliminate that which confirms what is the painful tooth; for if it moves regularly causing pain in and out of a healthy tooth, then you must eradthycele (remove) that thing until the painless malaligned/deformed tooth has been removed. Now we have seen this work performed by barbers.
So when you need to confirm which is the painful tooth and know it well, then cover where there may be any movement in the circuit of the affected tooth within its socket that contains any remaining vitality, introduce something into the gums of all parts so they can dissolve gradually, applying gentle friction with fingers or a fine instrument inside until such time as these particles have been removed.

The shape of the forceps and their delicacy are such that they will not harm the tooth during extraction—whether it is long or short/thin manipulation required; thus, these tools must be handled with utmost care when dealing with teeth in preparation for removal. The emphasis here likely pertains to dental procedures where precision and gentle handling are crucial due to potential pain and the risk of further complications if not done properly using specialized instruments like forceps or tweezers (tenacula).
They are employed with long manipulations whenever they extract teeth so that when you first handle them, the extracted items (teeth) will not bend and should be handled delicately to prevent damage or deformation after being removed from their natural position in the mouth.

When arthritis sets in the joint (huvula), and it is long-lasting, then its name cannot be named as straight; if inflammation occurs on a thickened, rounded part of the body, then they call it tumefaction or swelling.
When the body is healed by what we have discussed in division and there's no hindrance to your care, then you must apply caustic externally with quick actions; if it extends far or long (chronic), dark red or black blood that isn’t coming from a specific point, fear may arise regarding the location of such bleeding.

If indigestion occurs while practicing medicine, repeat that process and apply cauterization within the wine cup' extruding from the pot in the boundary of medical practice; cleanse it with water at this point, washing away what is inside the medicinal vessel, thus curing deep wounds on bandages.
This healing substance has been applied with care and placed for a considerable length of time out of fear.

May it not be that you do not have this instrument with you? Then take a can and place in the exterior of yourself an enclosure made of hay, so that the mouth of the bladder is warmed up; for the cavity of the hay prevents vapor from entering there.
This treatment is good for health.

Movements cling persistently to the buttocks or spine of the body, or another cause.
Now that you extract what appears to come from them above the surface where it is visible, place your tongue on the tool immediately before sunr║ing time, so that becomes clear whether this fluid present in their gallbladder (the "gua" could refer herein).
When the cause of vomiting is not apparent to you in the stomach and it appears that food has fermented therein; or if a stone from the gallblad0r comes up by belching (indicating biliary colic), or if a pebble, either moist claystone, lime stones, or dry peas come out through vomiting – this is when you will feel strong pain in your abdomen; then take these things firmly with your hand and translocate the gallbladder to where it used to be expelled.

The provided text appears to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise
When extracting gallstones from the gallblad0d, it is customarily done with care and precision. (Note: This translation attempts to convey a general meaning of removing something related to
When medicine is required for the bloodstone that has been mentioned in medical treatment and does not cause discomfort within the gallbladder of bile duct, consider now where this stone lies inside the liver's channel to which you have referred earlier; take then your tongue as an instrument provided by it. (Note: The translation attempts to interpret a procedure related to diagnosing or addressing issues with stones in organs mentioned.)
Then if you find a small or subtle injury, extract it carefully and with delicate attention.
If it is not possible to extract from there, then take a concave canula and insert that into the region of the swelling, place your hand in the indentation of the canula where the flame has been applied (making sure the effusion is dead and detached from the area), preventing any fluid discharge throughout the day.

If there is no water for cleansing that we have prepared, then cleanse the throat with incense or frankincense using the same tool used in steam irrigation of the mouth.
When cold humors enter into the body'dictly (in a sudden manner), they cause pain in various parts of it.
Another indication of operation in steam (suffocation), it is that you take hold of the jar wherein are burning carbons and cover this with an insulator; from below suffocation place your hand, keeping mouth to tongue contact at the end of the instrument's extremity. Securely clasped hands prevent further onset into sustenance (the air being introduced for breathing), which as soon as it reaches the organism’s cavity swiftly causes discomfort or pain therein; hence, you hold your mouth at its tip upon a cannula's end to ensure that suffocation is achieved within this space—where now suffering commences.
If not already done so, then repeat the subfumigation movements, and prevent the humors from drinking, eat salty and alcoholic foods, do not smoke, as these are necessary when this regimen is to be maintained.
This is the form of the tool with which one extracts gall when seen; it resembles forceps used times before, but there's no curvature here in this instance. the tablet on which he lies (lying down), and his extremity seems like a hawk'dict beak that is gripped by it, where it has been sharply scraped with lime for four days, so that when any cause arises, that thing will not hurt him.

May there be some instruments that, although not pierced but appropriately prepared for the disease in those places complementary to them.
So too those other applications that are disordered when they cross and do not mature according to their nature; similar to these applied at joints, which becomes prolonged within the body's circuit as long as water flows therein, corrupting the ligaments or nerves of that joint - thus causing its pain. If intervention is delayed until it reaches full ripeness in the main member (the thigh), then perforation must occur here; if not matured yet at this location too, piercing should be done immediately before degestion can even begin to complete itself – meaning any cutting performed will result in bloody discharge and elongation of parts within the anus. May you know the time for the puncture of the abscess, and so it is when it ripens.
Be aware that it matures when the pain subsides and fever ceases; reduce speechlessness and heart rate decline, strengthen the head of abscess formation, along with other symptoms.
When you know where the puncture site is, shortly after applying an abscess or purulent material from treatment of elevation occurs here.
Through piercing or puncturing deeply into the flesh or limb's parts where pain is localized in thighs and feet areas as well as nerves, tendons, ligaments; even reaching all abrasive locations hard to reflect upon, use perforation according to that specific body part.
When the abscess is in the flesh, then you must make an incision into it until its digestion is confirmed by two signs; if you pierce that area now, the patient's leg and groin will swell with dull noise, and their lips as well as depth of body will harden.
May an aseptic cautery be pierced according to the body'diction or as necessary by which part it is needed.

May those who cannot bear with surface lion claws can only be pierced so slightly above them; for once you penetrate that area, it is all the way through.
When the gangrene is thick and has already gathered disease (infection), do not attempt to extract it all at once; remove some from that area today, restore what was extracted into another part tomorrow, withdraw a larger portion as needed according to progression until full recovery occurs—this process of extraction and replacement.
Mostly if the malady is due to frothy phlegm or a pregnant woman' extrusion of fluids into her body cavity, and it causes chest discomfort; herein lies its resolution through expulsion from within (the disease), and you must perform operations on them.
Be very careful with this large needle, and insert it into the incision where you pierce these thorns; ensure that you keep them clean to avoid infections. Consider whether the pus from the abscess is scant or a flat layer—administer appropriate treatments for him/her as directed by ancient remedies or contemporary methods, if necessary. If it's large and there are fissures within the incision site where you enter, then pause in every section until we reach us.
If in the abscess it has detached part of the spine or if that area is concave within its circuit, then cover it with a soft cloth woolen fleece as you carry pans and razors; keep moisture on it until evening time, and apply those things to treat what comes from inside dressings where said abscess has healed.
If you harden the flow of bile during your operation, then apply water and warmth to these places where drops accumulate due to stagnant bile movement; place it over that location as well.
May the flow of blood continue if you maintain your regimen and care, as recommended in this book'dictory for proper division/balance.
If it is winter time and the ulcer location corresponds to a place where nerves are moistened with wine or oil for cautioning (cauterizing), then apply those over the respective locations.
If it is summer and the places are meaty, then when you pause pulpills at the beginning of the day with water and oil as we have said before, let all this flow into them until they become clean, which will happen during today'thy healing process (as mentioned earlier). Then cover any ulceration or pus removal that is needed for its treatment.

From the provided excerpt, it appears to be a line from an old medical or philosophical treatise written in what seems like Medieval Latin with some influence of other Romance languages
Movements habitually enter these joints (scrophulas) and into the abdomen (col hueve, which seems to refer to "belly" or possibly an old term related thereto), as well as angonars; and occasionally they affect other parts of the body.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
The following text is from an old medical treatise and can be translated line by line into English as follows:
So in that position of good disposition for the treatment (which is red and pervasive throughout the body without affecting the spinal cord or veins and arteries), as it'dictates by color similarity with bone marrow, place this superficial tissue from just above to below the line between .G. and .B., observe that extent within the whole partition (and extract little bits if necessary); now pinch those lips of the cheekbone gently or cut them entirely as required for our previous discussion in Chapter X under Apostles C, taking care slowly step by small step.

If you insert that entire abscess, then make sure the mouth and cheeks are adjusted by your fingers so as not to leave any unnecessary inflammation behind.
May it happen that there is an excessive overflow due to the greatness of the scrofulus (a type of tuberculosis in medieval medicine), and you understand its cause, then perform stitching as instructed.
And when the scrofulous that contain moisture within them is pierced here at your place of healing, and a deeper incision (perforation) made above where it was placed by you, as we have mentioned before, preventing any liquid from coming out.
And apply dressings with oil and similitudes to these things, so that the rotting fluid which is coming out of decay can be drained away from wounds. When you turn over the patient after washing them, then take care of that internal grease wax inside so it may be healed.

Return that which is inside so it can heal.
And do not assume that which is of dark hue, with little feeling, involving legs and foot reflexes; this may be cancerous growths.
When returning is due at this time for remembering the head position again.

The phrase provided, "curacio di eminenza dell'umbilico," seems to be Italian and translates directly
The eminence of the navel is pained due to causes such as cracks in which fluids may emerge; or for a hernia whose membrane should be reparem according to what has been stated, or because of constriction that flows from veins or arteries following previous damage described herein.
If there is a crack in the coccyx and through the fabric of flesh, then the color of the ulceration resembles that of the body; it hurts like a lion from different situations. If it is due to the expulsion of the budel (intestine/hernia), then upon recalling what we have observed about that person who has had water (fluids or excess thereof) and witnesses a vigorous difference, place them immediately back into position; with such urgency they are returned so swiftly. And exalt their status by leading them to bath and energetic exercise therapy promptly.
If due to moisture, it is like a lion and will not be hidden when you press with your hand on me, nor will it contract or swell up.
If it is about sanctioning, here you will appear the black decay descending upon these limbs.
If it is through flesh nothingness (meaning no injury or issue), then a serious and hard swelling occurs, and follows after a certain amount of time.
If it is due to windiness, then touching him with a lion'sea will be appropriate.
And if the operation on it is that you consider whether the navel'se eminence is due to a humorous discharge, or from veins and airiness; observe carefully as taught in this booklet which I have discussed here using arcanes (cauterization) and venesection.
If the prominency of the navel is due to the intestine or sling, then command that which contains it and keep it extended; also give a chain around all the circumference of the navel as you have marked on your hands, placing it between your thighs over what has been drawn out. Also extend the bandage surrounding the fracture wound in the circuit of the umbilicus above where you have made an impression with the drawstring; and pull up the treated parting at the joint (hips), fastening to each other both ends under the mark on your hands, holding onto it firmly.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: "Apply heat on the scab that has spread over the ligament and insert your finger into it at this place, and if you have touched or held onto the limb through the ligament, pull outward suddenly and drag the intestine back to its cavity.
If you have torn the fabric (possibly referring to skin or another material in this context), then take that one and apply it here; cut away any excess of it.
May it be contrary to your artery or vein, and around that area return to your work; take two needles and insert them into those fields strong enough, where you have pierced the abscess on knee joints causing pus discharge (abscess drainage), which perforate these areas with spears. Fix the abscess in four parts over the points of these instruments.
If you wish to act, place the needles and insert them where pain spreads in the flesh and crawls down by itself; as it subtly descends and is inserted therein yourself, take care that which comes out of the liniments while they are being absorbed into what has become inflamed.
If the navel is of meatless or due to moisture in it, cover that abscess immediately with what you have brought and cleaned away dirt from there, which contains moisture within it; also care for this wound water by covering it as well.

And when the urine is poured outside of itself in its own hourly quantity, if you remove that much and not within this time, then the malady will resolve according to your spirit animal' extramateral place where it was placed; or else five cures are brought for proper disposition.

Regarding the children whose bladder areas have not been perforated, here is a translation:
Some times children are sick from the womb of their mother, and/or the head of their mixture is not pierced (or it'thy ruptured or isn't in its place).
So therefore a cord or tendon is pierced as swiftly as possible through it, so that the stone (referring to uric acid crystal causing gout) can enter into its small joint subtly according to this manner.
Ensure rest in the wound with a subtle pin of iron and thread that hold it together, allowing for three days or four-and-three/fourth (3 days to roughly 4).
When one needs to use it for urination or defecation; return that amount back then.
If you do not stop the flow of blood, then it is possible that the urine which flows there will not be drained away by this cure.
May that from which it is displaced be treated with lead (plumb), as we have said before; for up to several days until its enlargement has occurred.
May those from which it is not in its place cause them harm, where they are led downward, and lift the penis up to their chest; this does not come from within themselves but because of venereal disease since semen cannot reach the womb through improper direction.

The provided text seems to be discussing a medical condition related to the penis, potentially referring to issues such as infection (acid), deterioration or decay ("corruption"), and attachment at the head of the erectile tissue ("cap of the verge"). Here's an attempt to translate it line by line into English:
Movements worsen in this joint and there is a large accumulation of fat.
From that one is harmful, and from the other it's not.
No harmfulness, when you suspend the subtle and remove what is within that whole world; then place it gently under there where it rests submerged in Egyptian ointment, and also apply this one on top to heal inside while being covered by such.
If the uterus is malicious and has a dark hue, then you must apply caustic preparations to its interior (the womb) and exterior (body surface), respectively.
May it be that the foreskin of the uncircumcised head of the penis exists (albater), and one part is cut off (dedintz), while another remains intact; when you hold this excision, consolidation occurs within so long as care is given to it. Meanwhile, your attention must also be on curing that remaining foreskin until such time the complete healing of all injuries has occurred and there'se no risk (quar) that a recurrence will happen when you are treating this penile skin again.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And you examine the genitals and foreskin blackness and hardening; thus covering all that has already been darkened and which is about to corrupt or rot, placing lines above it with a mixture of crushed honeydew millet grains and various types of seeds mixed together.

If the head of the gallbladthy is corroded and destroyed in an instant, then insert a metal tube into the abdomen's entrails to allow bile to flow through it at that moment.
In the attachment of the foreskin at the base of the penis (and this adherence is not removed circumcision; when it occurs due to dirt or scab) comes a sharp pain within that which has been dissolved and freed from under the head of the phimium entirely.

In the context of translation, this line can roughly mean: "On the refinement and care necessary for those who have undergone circumcision." Here's a possible English rendition based on historical medical texts that discuss postoperative procedures like circumcision in
The sentence in the medieval medical treatise you've provided translates to English regarding postoperative care after circumcision: "Circumcision is not cure for all illness as with other diseases, but perhaps if it aligns with our operation and intention (the doctor’thy or surgical intent), and specifically in children where there may be a purer pathway to health through simpler interventions.
So they say that ancient people did not perform circumcision on free men, nor do so with their own laws, and only because they have acquired it through experimentation. This causes the majority of artisans and barbarians to abandon traditional practices like circumcision and mundification using new pus (pus) and tar (tar). They use sinew from a clean animal and blood drawn by an unsheathed blade for this purpose.
E you have already tried all these methods and found no better improvement with knife or thread as used in refinement, whereby threads escape downward from the pubis below, upward between two tunics (undergarments), tightening it quickly, leading to other insights and pain-free knowledge.

In surgery with an unguent (ointment), if you do not observe care and cause damage, it will ruin your operation. The beard of the child is naturally short and tends to become greasy in this manner, but you have seen it yourself.
May the molding that is made with fores and nails (iron pins) provides strength; as I have experienced it myself, since these tools are proportionate according to size, just like how sharpness corresponds when used—therefore, if you prepare two sets of appropriate hardness in your hands, adjust them accordingly through a grinding process within an allotted time; this results in compression of the nail'falcon (the shape that contains part of the thumbnail) where it holds together with no mistake whatsoever.

When that joy can be what is possible for your intellect to receive, it will happen throughout the entire body. Here you prepare to ensure that he is not disturbed by excessive movement and conceal the tools in your hand or on his chest so that none of those present can see them.
Return your hand to the waist of him and place it on his neck while blowing air into it; take that one out which is suffering from inflammation in her, purifying what has been gathered there due to dirtiness (or impurities).

It appears that the text you've provided is in Latin, which has a significant historical context and can often be archaic or specialized to specific fields such as medicine (medical jargon) or law ("clausula legis"). The phrase "de qualitat de clisterizacio de la vezica am clampcedra e am semblant
When acute inflammation or ulcer occurs in the bladder (vesica), or when it is sore and has become congested therein; a catheter may be inserted into that area to drain fluids and medications, and this method of treatment would then involve:
sino que in the exterior of it is silent, thus it is closed. And in that situation, two of them have come together a certain number of times.
In the banquet is a place where it'se invited and its second quantity that rises up from there; when any cause pulls on those humidities, they are pulled out, and when expelled, water returns to them, as happens in naval battles at sea.
So when you want to prevent moisture in the bladder, insert its extremity into the wetness, and draw it towards that water which pushes against the parts above (i.softs), wherein the moisture is drawn upwards toward the top of the clyster.

Return the bladder to its place and stop there where moisture wants to crystallize in the bladder; put it between two strong ligaments of the pelvic bone joints so that this moisture can evaporate at the focus (likely referring to a specific point on the body for heating or treatment).
When returning the limb of the patient into its cavity, place your hand within it so that the limb does not protrude outwardly.

Having said where the operation takes place in which manner (and part), and a section/part of it has been mentioned or specified hereinabove.
The provided medieval medical text seems to follow a style influenced by Latin and other Romance languages, although it might contain archaic or obsolete terms not commonly used in modern English translations of historical texts. Here is the line-by-line translation:
And as that which is being reported herein appears manifestly clear and concise.
Therefore say that semen is produced mainly in the bladder during childhood; and from his urine it seems like water in its subtlety, appears therein [at those places], and inflames the urethra with flowing pains intermittently. Then dress her as directed hereafter for cleanliness of that part below.
When a child has reached four years within that place, and treatment in the legs is difficult. May in young people migrate due to these waters.
From that from which the stone is greater and poultice softer; if it's scanty, contrary to that.
So when you reach the treatment of that, cover it with a cloth from which we extract grease where everything escapes through those holes they have; and some days this hole prevents the escape of foul excrement necessary for investigation.
Return its position to the hips and groin areas, as well as containing excess fluid or urgency in order for the bladder to descend into the lower part of the womb, or which may leap from place several times.
Return that tool between your thighs where you prepared it earlier, and the rest of its contents are now on their legs; thus ensuring that the bladder as a whole descends downwards into the divisions gradually.
When appropriate for that particular one or all of it should be addressed/treated.
Then if you feel pain in the space, pull your leg over it immediately.
If not for a long time you have been touching the patient'dict of their left side, if it is due to inflammation in the belly (malady), or as stated when they are young and complete sexual maturity ("miga"), then take out that which has entered your hand and place it into their bottom. Through a channel of lead entered that which was within his body. When that small one goes into the neck of the bladder.
Return them over there upon it that they may be pressed down and removed from the parts beyond this place where your section resides.
When the master commands that he press on the bladder with his hand; and another minister is commanded to extend their right arm downwards towards the parts below him, and yet another minister tightens the coda whereby the genii are located in the part of which the section takes place.
Return it into its place (the abdomen), here is where this form lies down: And divide the water between the hips and genitals here, not in this place of heat at the left hip joint; let one section be on top of that stone within the belly, forming a transverse section so that it becomes wide and stretched according to what quantity is possible from that stone within the body without exceeding its capacity. If there are difficulties with defecation due to this issue (the condition being rectal blockage), such as constipation or difficulty in bowel movements caused by compression of feces, take measures accordingly because we have water here at these locations which may be causing it; when the necessary amount has been absorbed from that stone within your belly with whatever means is available (e.g., medicinal herbs), then you can defecate normally again as if nothing happened.
Be aware that there is any stone from which he may extract it (referring to something in the body), and cleansing of this thing will be difficult due to water.
From that fluid it looks like a lion roaring down on you and is round; its essence comes from the liver' extrication.
So if it is that which has been moved from its angle and margin, adjust in the crack.
If there is not a surgical intervention available (foro-getada), then you must take care of that part accordingly, or if it's compressed upon that point which has been lanced and limed on the bone where the compression occurs; do not leave without removing such instrument gently. Or insert right away an underhand tool for adjusting the extremity in question.
If you cannot apply pressure on that, then increase the disruption slightly and if there is a flow of pus present, break it apart with concentrated sulfur vinegar (vinager saturatus).
If the stone is within one of them (the kidnethy or bladder), then push it into the mouth of the urinary bladder, and press upon that area with your hand; also propel a small amount herein; apparently they are pains from diseases.
If it is stone of great weight, then ignorance leads you to insert that large section into the bladder; for this causes damage either because it stays or because it ascends from continuous urine production, and thus not all the location will be fully healed.
When administering the removal of it within or due to a fracture inside where tools are being used to extract that from wards, do so before they exit through painful places (possibly indicating urgent treatment is needed).
So when you have completed your task, then fill the wound with the juice of Aloe and dragon'dictum, tightening it up afterward. When pressure is applied over that cloth steamed with oil and vinegar or water infused (as the poultice), it will cause suppuration to cease.
Return the intestine or hernia to its cavity and do not pull on the ligament inside until tomorrow.
When that air has departed, apply water and oil here, ensuring they are thoroughly moistened within so that it may heal.
May you apply cauterization to heal and remove decay, as if the patient's bladder is frozen within them, and through it urine cannot escape (and this liquid exits when the bladder causes its own rupture), so insert your tool into the wound and extract that very sank which provokes further damage to the bladder.
Return the water and salt within it for purification purposes against all kinds of species; this is what they bring you here for healing.
In those hours of total healing that you lie with both thighs and adjust the drugs which are paused over the location,
If the stone is small and located in the bladder, it remains therein, and catheterization of urine is prohibited; hence we treat that which comes through this curative action as a blockage. You have already punctured the spot where the stone is present, keeping pressure on its location — such actions previously accused of causing obstruction; now you grasp hold of a hollow iron instrument for withdrawal:
From outside the cavity, gout resides in a pipe (or tube).
Return your body position straightly, and hold it at this place until nothing returns back into the bladder space.
Return the iron in the wound and penetrating it quickly until the puncture instrument enters that stone. And rotate the cautery in your hand on that small stone gradually, and perform the puncture of it until another from the other parts enters, at which point the urine is expelled completely.
Return your hand over the substance that is being broken off from the bone' extruded joint (which causes inflammation), and it becomes a place where urine flows out; herein, the uric acid dissolves away as part of healing.
If this cure is not within your reach for any reason that prevents you from doing so, then apply a finger or thumb to the stone (presumably meant as an acupressure technique), and another such method under the stone. Translation of each line into English: Return that back (or out of place). In this context, it likely means returning something Retrieve and cleanse the ligaments and swollen joints (which are made in the mud). In this context, it suggests that one should carefully remove any foreign material or dirt from their injured body parts—specifically referring to getting rid of impurities attached to their connective t
It is not necessary for the ligaments to be made of fresh bone immediately afterward (but rather to prevent returning to bladder), and another bandage above it only if when you take apart that which was attached atop, then said tendon returns to its place absorbing mud. Here "ligament" refers to a connective tissue used in the medical context of this era for stabilizing joints or repairing injuries; “tendin” and “codena,” likely referring similarly but possibly with regional variations (e.g., coduna being another term that might have been more common elsewhere), signify bands placed over injured areas to provide support during healing—this part of the sentence instructs on when and how
When you have to take apart that which is above (the removed item), lift the tendon back there as far as possible or return with your offering/gift—this absorbs moisture like we've discussed here before. This implies a responsive care routine, suggesting immediate action when restoring ligaments and possibly other support structures after they have been used ("desus," likely indicating something that has come loose). The reference to "cobra la plagua" may allude metapthyically or literally—to soak up moisture as if absorbing mud.
In the context of translating a medieval medical treatise, it appears that you
From bone above (the breasts). In this instruction from an olden text on medicine or surgery procedures involving women's breast
Pebble in the breasts is scarcely produced.
If you find a stone among those, it is difficult to cure him, and this procedure is forbidden by excessive manual manipulation.
The one of them is the woman who is very strong in her veins.
And if you do not find a woman who removes herself when the doctor examines her during casting or is from among women with wombs (possibly referring to pregnancy), then:
The clear woman here does not want this art for herself, mostly because of surgery at her hand (meaning the surgeon'thy role).
The location of the section over the breastbone in women is longer than that on the chest area, and it gives rise to fear when preparing for a dissection or examination thereof.
If it is necessary for you to bring someone up to the water (presumably in some form of treatment or bathing), then take a female midwife and do so gently without causing her distress.
Might you lack that which is sought after, then seek a skilled midwife for assistance in the care of women'thy bodies or find another competent woman who can also participate at this division of labor.
So act this present, and command it to assemble all the humors that you have commanded, from inquisition on the stone (uterine examination) up to its consumption; which causes that if the woman is venerable, take away what belongs to her husband into his buttocks so she may desire the pearl.
So if you crush that, compress it quickly there and command them (the patient) to insert on top of that.
May it not be a wound, then the matron commands that their dress is thrust into the hollow of the patient'thy hump and fastened over her left side on the bladder; apply such good linen to compress or bandage.
So if you abuse it, then wait until that which is orrible from the bladder reaches its parts near the joints at high tide within where it can enter into the hollow of the thigh to reach there fully.
Return the instrument inserted into that position of the coccyx to where it is lowered in that division and held there by hand; do not move it from its place quickly after insertion.

Excise that, and observe carefully so you do not insert it there; your excision is where he may be hanging by his hair at most or subtly present, which inspects according to the quantity possible within yourself.
Through proper application (insert) into/into the cisternal cavity of water and remove all the water.

May it happen if the procedure for that which is removed from its belly during your operation occurs at that time of day; when you have completed the section of the cystopexy (surgical fixation), return what was taken out and adjust the lips of the urethra within the abdomen'dict, ensuring careful handling as if with other creatures until it is healed.
If you have corrupted the humors through another illness, then take care of the vessels that carry them out and extract the humor, paying attention to what we previously mentioned.
May if water is added to any of the parts mentioned herein, then you understand that these are hernias; therefore investigate and incise this part as has been done in another region of the body; and if it'se a surgical operation for me, I shall perform it.
Return your stockings and they enter the soaked wool immersed in oil or vinegar. Hold another piece of this wet wool that you have submerged in wine and oil, expanding it over two thighs and abdomen; pause above folded and powdered sheets, and bind these together with a thread as follows:
And place two pressed sheets and woolen padding according to this resemblance; they are bandages on the extremities where one is inserted into or near wet wool, and another in structure within the waistcoat of the breeches, with one end entering at the crotch, and the other ending at the hip joint. The entire ensemble is adjusted to fit inside the breeches' waistcoat.
And when this hernia is treated artificially with fine needle cautery in place of excision by iron, and you grasp the caustic under one'thy tongue that contains water within its bladder (the gallbladder), then hold it as follows: and it is composed in Greek letters.
When it is necessary to make an incision in that area, and then all of the moisture will be expelled from there.
Return the sinew that is cut, and cleanse it with knives sharpened finely, excoriate also with these fine-point cauteries where possible within your reach; attend diligently until you have eradicated all of him/it (the patient), and keep watch to ensure the flame of the furnace does not touch.
You understand that this operation is a safeguard against excess sanitary flow and better than an incision.
May you encounter counteraction when applying cauterization at the time of cutting or during cautery treatment, and if that happens due to an outflow of phlegm as treated by me, attend to it immediately according to what has been stated hereinabove.
May the patient fear if their abdomen is painful and they do not hope for a second operation due to its horror, then perform an incision as recommended by you; when certified that we have discussed the meanings, it will be clear that this hernia is pervious.
When you make an incision in the patient'thy hips raised by some kind of elevation, pierce through the abscess located at the lower part of his chest bone (the spine), and stop the puncture according to the length of the wound.
When I have made a wide opening for all of the water to flow through.
Return your pace over the place of connection and hold that one there while also holding this other, to prevent the patient'dict body from being washed away by water. Return that which is inside so that it may be healed.
May it be that contrary attraction to water at this time when you pierce the patient: and here no pain is from water but rather because of white phlegm in the airs within the swamp, which prevents healing with whatever pains or instruments used for extraction; adjust a small one on top.
E understand that water returns and is reabsorbed over several months or days; when it accumultes, according to the physician's methodology, then an opening occurs as if the humors are passing their course in a day.

The text concerns the fear of losing oneself to death in major complications due to what is possibly referred to as "carnose" or fatty lipoma, and it seems a doctor advises that by leaving this condition ("lu") behind one can be saved from greater harm. Here's an interpretation with translation:
When recalling that operation in it which pertains to those instruments of appliances (the medical tools and devices used during surgery).
So say that the pain is present in the parts where muscles are attached and feels acute due to excessive build-up or impact: either it bursts into the muscles, or because of a hit/strike.
It is according to the body'supremacy of colors and it does not cause pain in its own suffering; this ulceration (or lesion) is grave.
When there is an ulcerated area that has darkened and does not center itself in its place.
Here come some pains due to the knotting of veins and/thy swelling where it has already been noticed, or through inflammation of those same vessels.
May it be known that when the inflammation of bladder stones is perceived, they are discovered through the dispersal of plaque fragments upon grinding those same pebbles; and do not touch them with your hands.
May that which is pain due to inflammation of a vein not be scattered by any cause and requires compression on the parts mentioned above.

So if there is already meat congealed within it (the body), then you must remove the excess and insert what has been taken out.
If there is attachment within any cause of cholera or between the vessels (blood), then you must release all that attachement and insert it through a round incision.
May it be that the nativity of flesh in the place behind is what lies there, then insert everything from here into it and extract its humors with us as we have done before.
So once your operation is complete, fill the wool with oil and vinegar; then carefully tend that which has been healed by another remedy within it.

The treatment for intestinal prolapse, or in Latin "cura di hernia enterale." Here is
The occurrence of this hernia happens due to a section expanding over the abdomen's organs as if they were levers in the belly'dictum, whereby pieces from that breach travel upwards towards above-the-abdominal sections. This sentence suggests an understanding that when part of the intestine prolapses or bulges through a weakness in the abdominal wall ("ventre"), it is often due to internal pressure and movements within the body, described metaphorically as mechanical levers exerted by organs located below the belly button. The translation attempts
This rupture is either from the belly button or due to excretion by these organs for various reasons: because of percussion (tapping), pressure (sauch), roaring, elevation of any severe cause, or imitation. Herein lies a medieval medical interpretation suggesting that hernias may result not just organically—through factors like tapping on the abdomen ("percussio"), applying force to it due to activities such as coughing ("per sautz") and straining during bowel movements when there's excessive gas or constipation, which creates pressure in the intestines. The translation indicates that these actions can exacerbate a pre-ex
When the belly button is strained due to extension of it (likely referring again to a hernia), pain occurs sporadically and not continuously, but rather in brief intervals—and does not dissipate immediately once resting or lying down on one's back. This suggests that symptoms might come with intermittent intensity as opposed to constant discomfort ("accideys pauc" meaning 'occurs infrequently,' and "no accideys soptament," implying it does not ease up immediately). The original language implies a restorative action is taken by placing pressure inside the navel (belly button), effectively pulling or pressing
When the patient' extrusion occurs through one of its sections and causes severe pain suddenly; various symptoms appear on the seemingly protected area, caused by intestinal obstruction, and these issues arise from what is in the body (likely referring to blockages or other problems within).
Some movements have made its way out of the intestine (belly), and this is called an abdominal hernia here.
Some days there is pain due to wind invasion, and some times it enters through the open wound of the intestine; herein lies the great harmony of the humors, which leads occasionally into severe pain when pressed upon.
In the treatment of this illness's spices we must fear lest it be inadvertently released therein.

The sentence in English would be: "In the treatment of cords surrounding the testicles in male patients is softened by gentle massages after which care and monitoring are advised."

The original Latin-influenced text implies that such treatment is beneficial and should be followed by attentive care afterwards for proper
The English translation for the given text is: "Thus it becomes necessary that someone takes care of him who makes jizz, and encompasses entirely over which softening has occurred naturally on its own; and to adjust both lips as if they were stitched." This line seems rooted in a traditional medical context discussing male reproductive health or hygiene. The mention of making "jizz" suggests concerns with seminal fluid, possibly relating to ejaculation issues, while the softening mentioned could refer to scrotal swelling which is self-resolving ("natural"). Adjustment and care are recommended by a medical practitioner (perhaps an urologist or healthcare provider). This line
The English translation for this medieval medical text would be: "And if you wish to consider excess softening of the cords as three or four cookings, and then secure a stitch."

However, I can attempt to interpret your request by identifying key
The text appears to be a mixture of archaic or pseudo-medical Latin with elements reminiscent of Italian ("la comensament" and "suspenda") and some phrases that don't form coherent English sentences but seem related to obstetrics (the field dealing with childbirth). Here is an attempt at translating the key ideas into more understandable modern English:
So when you handle those limbs, ensure that the patient's belly is compressed so that their embryo will not be expelled while they lie on their back, and give them a second time for cleansing with what has been good to use in cleaning.
May that which is not natural and unbearable be here when you sit on your feet and the head of yours comes down over your neck, or if it rests atop your chest, or upon your navel, then turn yourself onto your back so much so that none of its figures remain without being laid flat.
When there is necessary cause for it all befalls on the midwife who must be wise and subtle in all these things, so that she may avoid errors and deceit.
When showing all of that figure and what is within it, thus allowing it to be understood by the doctor for its significance over water (body fluid) balance:
When the joint is in its natural place on the head and it hurts intensely there, especially for women who have these parts holding them tightly, they feel pain where their bodies hold them, and sometimes this condition causes discharge of bile made from fenugreek and other bitternthy humors.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return the metal instrument between your fingers and in that place where there is already a cushion, or put another one herein; this will hold its own moisture within it. Precede her abdomen inside so that she may deliver the child.
If not done so, then cover the woman with a wax of linseed and fennel to be circumcised (this implies that they are performing an operation like male genital surgery).
Here comes the command to him/her, take charge of his/her medication and apply that particular rubbing necessary now; put your mouth and nose on it until they have gone through this time at the forum-guildhall.
If your feet' extruding teeth (perhaps referring to abscesses or pus formation) are present at the entrance of passageways/entrances into body cavities, then you should gently reduce that which is easy and small by parts. If she does not obey the interior (the internal humors), then lift her up on a cushion and remove her feet from here, place the cushion onto the ground; ensure that the woman remains upright to prevent collapse due to invasion of spirits or excessive fluids.
If the mass is not detached and remains attached to the abdomen or chest of the patient, then you must incis it there with a knife until an even cut is achieved; this will be done through their clothes using a drape as coverage.
When the fetus lies on their feet, and you push it down into them gently while holding its head (the fetus), making sure to warm it up slightly as well as securing one hand undernethy legs and another over their chest where they hold your hands.
When he is inside the thighs, then you command him to express himself, and make that protrusion conformable, provided that God will allow it.
If there is not enough water to bathe the patient as recommended, then gradually return the small fetus (the body part being bathed) within while pausing that second natural figure of urine formation; this allows for sufficient hydrthy and helps eliminate uric acid build-up.
If it is prohibited to take all the humors we have recommended, then begin with muscle massage from high altitude and softened gum dissolved therein; strike them thoroughly in the mortar for beneficial percussion, and apply lines of this fluid on a woman' extrices (a poultice), where lies her abdomen base. In this procession of translation from an old medical text written with phrases reminiscing Latin and other Romance languages, here is the line by line interpretation:
When parts of him are softened and he lies under the steam from myrtle (and places there for absorption) that cushioning is applied to it, thus ensuring its moisture retention at this place. When you place the sub-fumigation undernethy for an hour, then apply it to a cushion (or pad), and use that tool along with extending their mouth opening and pressing down on the lower part of their belly wrapped in tight compression; this will cause them relief once they have gone through as much pain.
Eye salve hanging loosely from one of its most (translation may vary slightly as this is a transliteration task, not direct translation). The phrase appears to be in Old French with Adjust the amount of heat on it; if you cannot reduce that yourself, lift up the woman and guide her there (translation may vary slightly as this is a transliteration task). This sentence suggests some form of manual adjustment or intervention related to managing temperature, possibly in an ancient medical context where such direct actions were taken for treatment.
If it is not possible to proceed further, then place the leg on the leather cushion (a form of restraint), and forcefully press down their hips together for a strong contraction, applying liniments made from mucilage as recommended by them.
If childbirth has occurred, then apply that poultice over the cesis (the vulva), and study how to reduce swelling of the ma (belly), shaping the fetus into its second natural figure, and induce labor by commanding it to contract itself for delivery.
Examination of the belly expanded its hips and face, located at two on their mother' extrinsic positioning. When the matron holds her hand over the fetus and gently turns it little by little, this makes things easier.
When it is as much you have entered, and the pause rests on its chest with what we recommend from oil and mucilage:
Here comes the translation: Exitus of fetus prepared above side (or abdomen).
When the uterus is discharged in this manner of menstruation, think about it, and when you examine the second stage inside your finger wherein its fluid can be expelled to remove moisture.
If the fetus is hanging over the face and neck of it (the patient), then cut that part of the endemic to ensure it does not remain stuck or stagnant.
Here the patient is urged to propel their fetus into different parts within where pauses are set aside for that second cover during which a woman (possibly his wife or partner) can rest and recover her strengths, provided she wishes to undergo abortion if God will.
Exit of twins or fetuses (or possibly multiple). You know that bones rub against each other constantly, and sometimes several times a day, which may be strange or unnatural—may this not disturb the soul? Or perhaps these are natural causes of life itself; either way, they exist as part of living.
When these things are observed—even if they appear swollen like a tumor and separated by threads (suggesting the presence of an abscess), several visits to the clinic will naturally lead to healing, while some additional appointments may be needed when working with herbal remedies as prescribed.
If it is difficult for them to carry their child and they come upon us with the things we have spoken about natural figures not being possible, then take care of these children as we have described.
If the midwife is subtle and gentle in applying warmth that makes things easy and quick, and smart as per their entirety according to how they are prepared for healing by wise craftsmendoctors:
Remembrance of what formed within the womb and is miscarried/aborted.
Some of these are formed in the month one, and two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight or nine; I must verify that a woman has aborted once, another ten times, which causes pain measured by the great learned ones.

And when the woman is sitting on a bed with her head inclined downwards and her hips raised, so that both shoulders are lowered along with lifted thighs:
The minister takes that of her parts or which is bound to the body, in such a way that nothing from the child can extend beyond and be extracted.
And return your mouthwash for her throat, containing honey and the juice of althea and fennel and lentil seed; this will moisten the patient'thy mucous membranes with relief from dryness due to excessive humors.

Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the attempt goes inward and does not enter where you intend it to be (the rectum), but between that place and what is hoped for flesh or sinew, then a fistula forms on the surface of the navel; hence dry out the navel area affected by the fistula with salt as directed therein.

La cause is to administer in it one of three remedies: or that which cauterizes the ache as we have described; or that by which healing will be assured once its cavity has been restored, allowing you to insert pus and care for what comes out therein. Do not process amputate lest fragments remain within the boil; so health can restore itself when desired – if it is strong enough like we've described here - or extend that membrane over which pus was expelled as a result of said procedure, using whatever sharp instrument available for precise intervention at such sites. Furthermore apply wound dressing to all in the affected area; and should poultice placed above fail to solidify, an opened fistula will protrude from below the buttock region due to abscess formation therein through malicious intentions of evil spirits. And some times the fistula is finished according to this methodology: it's when you insert a tool into the fistula and reach inside its cavity at the back of the belly button, where on the skin surface above the navel and along the edge of the belly button, one inserts said tool with caution as if using a surgical needle to treat internal wounds according to this approach:
And insert into that faithful covering of fields or surroundings them, and attempt to place the foot within the fistula wherein follows the completion of its cavity.
May it penetrate into the margin of the anus properly inserted therein; and extracting its end, adjust both ends to these examples being twins (i.imaginative interpretation), apply each one for a day or two, until at most you can insert that very tip back inside flesh where those meat-like body parts are between the extremities of the tongue and belly button.
Then apply care until it is consolidated and healed.
May it be that the orifice of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in any way you have prepared for it, but only if there'dict need within its entrance to insert a catheter; and place it wherever healing will occur.
The shape of the spine is what causes a fistula to be split: its curvature makes it sharp and the other division does not make it sharp, thus there'dictor need only intervene sometimes.

Even if there is little moisture in the foreskin according to its position within a few days and according to the skin's color, it can lead to issues that may require attention from doctors following these steps:
And the cure for that which is inserted into the colon (which likely refers to medication or treatment) is that you command the humors in the gut to settle and be expelled within where they appear, at your behest. Now you grasp and suspend your knife above that piece which holds the bloods of your nails, and then strike them with those very ones; apply these to their reasons (i.dictors or sources of pain).
May it be that the pins are not held in those places due to their humidity and softness, then take these sharp cloths or a pointed needle or woolen fabric, apply them between the points of attachment, and grind some ash grains on top for lubrication; thus they will remain attached at sites of cauterization according to what has been previously established in the methodology of cauterizing. Return that care for it contains healing within which has been administered; take further care of such treatment until fully cured.
If the belly does not obey expulsion, then tighten and apply crisping on where bitternthy bite is located inside it (the intestine), using that water which exists in one's colon to prevent rejection during evacuation when the intestine comes out.
If the hemorrhoids are found at the bottom of their belly (anus), then it is because of humidity/dampness (leugiera - possibly indicating a damp or moist condition related to ill health in this context), and you must grasp those with your finger, either as they come out naturally or by pinching them gently; once done so, apply the appropriate remedy for what has been mentioned within that which will heal these.
And for those who pierce insensibly according to this manner: take hold of the thread firmly and insert it into the needle; push the swellings outwards from above on each side as you place, wrapping the extra threads around that part quickly after inserting the needle. Then straighten out what has been punctured in structure, position their fingers properly with respect to the thread, remove extraneous parts of this firmly held string by thrusting it away from where the other end is inserted into the skin, and do so lengthwise; now repair that part affected precisely.
When all is taken and only that one not used (the excess), it will be removed from the liver to alleviate its surplus therefrom.
And place your hand over the belly, dipped in oil or wax; and this same one rests on the colon while commanding the humors to stop their flow.

When such joints are weak and ineffective for this medicine, then cover them with either the sponge or your own moistened and held skin flap placed beneath where those secretions flow outward from below, which prevents their coalescendo; take care that they enter only when consolidated.
When you have applied those potent remedies vigorously, and they enter where motion begins to heal them thereafter with care.

Of healing diseases/illnesses.
You are already in the division of healing from illnesses that were suitable for free choice, and you prescribe this cure along with those remedies and medicine according to their complementarity.
So it is said that sores are varied according as they appear and where pus forms them (the lesions).
When the causes of movements are humors that ascend with pebbles in their movement or insertion into openings such as veins or cavities, or by percussion using a lance, club, sword, staff, or objects similar to these causing those same reasons for motion.
May the humors that are present in the body'softhe head, neck, chest, belly, back, and limbsresemble worms crawling over them, which appear similar to those found within the members (limbs).
Even when recommending treatments for some diseases, they pause and reason over other ailments as well.
When discussing simple diseases, remember that the consideration of complex ones will come to the meal in their third chapter.
Then consider that when pain in the head is simple and not a fracture, think: if it's due to stone dislocation or appearance of stones within, then you should adjust your position (and breatthy) as much as possible immediately upon seeing this; at no time delay - extract from there according to the quantity/extent present unless any reason prohibits cauterization. Here is the translation line by line:
And if it is a fracture of the opposite side that is afflicted, and protect the groin from overeating meat and wine as well as heavy dishes;
May it be that by careful observation I prevent any cause from arising and thereby reduce the intake of food (meat) and drinks altogether.
When pressure is applied over dirt or water in which the patient'seffected spot has been immersed (cauterized), heat gets conducted into that area, where it sets and hardens (stitches).
If you are sure of applying the poultice, then rest on the ground if his wound and air have not recently dirtied that which should be applied gently to him.
If the air has changed its quality, then place your hand inside where you put on gloves until it is healed.
May it be if the child is large or because of insufficient space and appearance, and their lips are not adjusted for sucking as recommended by the instructions on their catheter.
May it be discovered that the child already has bone and pen exposed and is not restrained by you but only with a small suspensor; therefore include that in your medicines and restore flesh to its place of origin under pressure from what causes swelling: caps, figolli, cheeses, etc., until they are made into compound.
If there is rot in the spine and it does not stick to the bone, then you will cut off all this putrefied substance and apply oil carefully.
If in these diseases an artery or vein through which the flow of blood could occur is not removed by medicine, then ask about that vessel; and if you cut it (which should never be done), make a stitch with thread made from spine or ligament thereof. And if what has been said here does not alleviate discomfort, perform cauterization within the wound wherein the blood flow is present.
If these plagues are simple and small, then the cause of them is humidity; hence apply powder on those places until this moisture changes (presumably into dryness).
The following is the line by line translation of the medieval medical treatise:
And apply firm pressure to that area below the mouth with these pills and leaves it there without letting go while not being swallowed; this is what medicine within will heal when taken as directed, according to tradition:
When any one performs cautery alone, it is not in their power unless they have your seances and sanctus of dragon at hand.
And now this operation is performed on the great humors when it'se deemed necessary that they be stopped and have not recently changed in their essence or airiness, which has not been disturbed by anything.
If the air is altered, and especially in summer time, you do not understand where this powder should be placed, then take care of those areas with stronger decoctions that we have mentioned before; place them there accordingly so they can produce poultices when wet – and afterward ensure these remedies are inside for their healing purposes.
May you alleviate a bone fracture in the body and it is requested that this be done with your gesture.
When directing the treatment of skull fractures that are inflamed with fire,
From "the humors of the colon.
If you find acid in the chest, it is not different from medicine treatment there and when found on the head of a child where simplicity prevails,
May the nerve of the colon or artery already be inscribed or exposed; if it is, not in this place but to prevent such care that causes violent stitching sensation, similarly as with vinegar and semblance for their eyes which they do not use on these vessels. No joints stop for any cause of complete madness; the substance of nerves is fire and its continuous flow to the brain which they place in all members themselves.
If water is needed for the treatment of unrefined medicines, then some are soaked in clear or scented oil (or not), and stones/pebbles ground according to this methodology when washed with running water, along with other pebbles; they are wrapped in wool.
If the child is large, then administer stitches or trim their lips, and take care that they are cleaned inside until healed.
If there is depth or hardness in the lower portion of what has been probed and punctured here, then make an incision at this spot to drain outpus (pus).
If in the earth there is an inserted artery and a flow of blood has been obtained from it, then separate or dry out that one, or perform cautery on it if necessary to provoke water (to restore proper circulation).
May you have inserted the spondyles of the gout or all, and thus saved the veins in the collarbone; thereafter adjust your lips on the crest over the joints without touching it; afterward return that to its natural figure, tighten it with a binding suitable for construction, leave it like this through several days until healing occurs.
May it happen that the child already has pain in their bones, and you will strike that area; if there are fragments of bone present, remove all those pieces you can from them; and if none is removed by you, let water enter so that the child's body may be cleansed, separating flesh (or soft tissue) from its natural habitat within the body.
If the patient is recently born then grind over that powder which has been recommended for you. May it be that when there is an opening (fistula) in the patient'dict land, then take care of such water as will remember to come back into its own headspace here at their skullcap/head region.
If it is from lance or cottle and sometimes you determine the depth, then also take into account that if the wound was caused by flying dirt when blood enters (indicating possibly an infection), know well that the soil itself can be deadly.
If there is no depth and the patient's sanction has not yet been cleansed today, then you pause in that hole of the first hour after morning purification, without straining so as not to prevent the sanc from being retained deep within it and returning to the heart, possibly pausing with oil applied therein, while avoidance is maintained for those guidelubs until day's end.
If the ointment is not at hand, then rest in the bath containing cold water poured for you so that sweat comes out from undernethy's skin; and make the swelling go down as it goes through your body where there is already fluid adjusted to its place.
May if already three days have passed without spasm or convulsion of the bad humors in the bowels, nor tightness of chest and abdomen; when then other good measures are provided by you, as understood wisely who patient is saved from ill health—therefore treat him with poultices and care for that which has been healed.
If the healing of it is delayed and at all times covered up, then you will know that there has already been a leakage (fistula); therefore take care of this using your own knowledge as guidance.
If the patient has a fracture from falling or injury and it is simple on the surface of the skin or back, then treat that area with water (if large), plaster (if small).
If there is pain before the eye and if those teeth are separated (meaning loose or detached wisdom teeth), then use forceps to extract those teeth now. If they are not separated, let them be led out that the vermin may escape from their presence.
From other accidents in other body parts, health is restored by the fluid we have mentioned before.
From stomach troubles or disturbanse of digestion (interpreted based on context). The phrase
The condition which causes pain in the stomach is either great or small, or it migrates (possibly indicating variable symptoms such as cramping that move around). The translation captures a description of abdominal discomfort and suggests variability in its intensity or location
For a slight disruption it is felt difficult by others to manage and if not contained (restrained) from its entry into their place of residence through your action as withholding, then the person becomes swollen for that which enters inside them makes pain hard to bear—implying constipation or obstructions within can exacerbate discomfort. Here the translation delves deeper into how not effectively containing (managing) intestinal issues such as blockages could lead to increased physical strain and heightened sensitivity, causing significant distress when stool accumulates due to a lack of intervention or containment by caregivers—referred here possibly as 'coytes', which may indicate older malevolent forces within the body in medieval medical philosophy. The mention of becoming swollen highlights an exac
And thus the worst disturbance is migrating; in that case it becomes difficult to reduce (address) its nature—similarly challenging as with these specific intestinal issues mentioned earlier ('las dosaiças especiall', which may refer specifically to conditions like constipation or other digestive dysfunctions). Here, the translation emphasizes how severe and moving discomfort in the abdomen can be particularly troublesome since it poses significant difficulty when attempting rem
Here comes the first sentence to translate: "Be aware that intestinal surgery is performed with four kinds of knives, and if you want stitches for wounds on other parts of the body, they are common like those used in surgeries.
Two other stitches communicate with each other or themselves in the abdominal suture, perhaps but more likely among themselves.
When you recommend any one of these examinations or declarations for me.
So say when the child is small and suffers from some cause of the intestine, it'dicts that reduction becomes difficult; either due to its diminutive size as we have mentioned beforehand or because the inflation of the intestine occurs through cold air exposure.
And when the fluid is ascending (or rising), it's time to cut that which you immerse a moist woolen cloth alone in water or squishy, and cloves, mustard seeds, and ointments into what' extruded body cavity this phlegmatic inflammation resolves.
And when some measures have been taken in which the application of water has led to improvement, it is better than pure water alone for resolution of inflammation.
When the inflammation is resolved (when), then you moisten the intestine/hernia with water in which it has been soaked and bathed; this will relieve the patient'thy internal organ due to a small cause or triggering event.
If it is possible to release the interior of him for this treatment, then divide the rupture into small pieces using an instrument on which they have been previously placed (emboled).
The initial sentence translates line by line as follows in English:
Of that tool, its form is thus:
One sharp turn of it (the body), and the other not acute, and the subtlety is not that of bone, because they are blunt a few inches in length.
And when the worm is increased and comes out of the intestine, it'thy reduction should be according to its natural form in its proper place if possible above water, which is better for health.
When the disruption is wide open and it' extraneous parts of the belly below your two knees (your lower legs), where you place a cushion, putting down supports under them so that their heads rest on these supports; and if in this parting above the stomach, put their head as well.
Here comes the first source sentence translated line by line into English:
When it is necessary that water be applied in large pains and in painful discharges,
In small pains, pause what has been prepared for you by the servant who is between your fingers clenched tightly (this hand), which holds the entire disruption in its grip and adjusts your lips, as well as bridging from that cause to another if any suture was applied.
Here is the line-bymediate translation of each sentence in English:
Here comes the first source sentence translated line by line into English:
When needles move between crudity and subtlety, the fine ones insert into flesh; and the coarse ones have difficulty in penetrating bone, thus it is that they migrate from fineness to coarseness.
When the needle is not inserted into any of the patient'dicts prepared limbs, to ensure that flesh does not protrude and filth doesn’t come near their healing process.
And they are not supposed to be stitched up so that the patient is not prevented from healing.
Return the fingers of the needles so that they do not pierce through his sleep; pause over the sewn, puffed-up stitches from all around, which hold the ends of the needles' fingers; and place those inside where you know the flesh has healed.
These sewing needles have been carefully placed in the small wounds, and for their stitching just a needle or thread is sufficient to secure those closures.
May the second stitch be common: and it is that you gently perform a stitch on all four extremities (hands and feet), from wrist to ankle, using a needle with fine threadwork and thickness.
When the needle has penetrated these four extremities (hands and feet), reduce the needle of that piece which you are using at present, so that the wound'dictum retreats into its lower divided part to where cloth bandages can be applied tightly.
When there is a space between any stitch of said body part, its size or quantity must be measured out accordingly.

During childbirth, it is considered a decay that occurs quickly when the navel area comes into contact with poisons from snakes and worms, which are born between the belly button (naval) and skin of the body causing potential complications or harm to both mother and baby.

Here 'pausa la puncta' implies halting further progression of a certain point – possibly for diagnostic purposes like measuring venous pressure or blood flow using medical equipment such as catheters, which are inserted and removed based on need ('voles').

Realize that the nose is not broken but rather separated into parts pushed upwards (which are said to resemble boats), with each part possibly having one or more breaks, specifically in cartilage—this separation does not result from a break per se, nor pain directly linked to bone fracture; instead, it stems from twisting and constriction.

Apply these substances to reduce the swelling, placing them over the bandaged area for relief.
And when that bandage is applied and adjusted on him, without altering the position of his bones, so it may heal properly and strengthen the fracture; this injury tends to recover within three days.
If another wound occurs after the application of a caustic treatment as guided herein, apply what we have discussed for those previous injuries inside where it is healing and treat that ulceration accordingly.
If the fracture is young (immature), consider whether it has been separated from or dislocated in the bone, then adjust those fragments to where they belong within the skeleton' extraneous fluid that doctors find necessary for healing during treatment.

When the shoulder blade (furcula) is dislocated, it typically requires medical attention to be restored correctly and safely. Here's a translation of your sentence
When the shoulder blade (furcula) is dislocated from frequent use of its associated muscles, this injury can be categorized into one of three types: simple reduction where it returns to position on its own or with gentle manipulation; partial displacement which may require a more careful repositioning often under sedation due to pain and potential for further damage; or complete dislocation necessitating immediate medical intervention, usually through closed reduction (
When the shoulder blade (furcula) is broken or dislocated into two parts that do not come together naturally, it complicates its return to normal positioning - herein lies a medical conundrum: If external manipulation in an attempt at restoration proves too challenging due to pain and potential for further damage during the procedure – professional surgical intervention may be necessary. When such fractures are displaced or non-union, where bone fragments have not healed properly together - it is akin to having 'a wandering fragment', complicating repair; often demanding intricate reconstructive techniques by surgegy specialists who must align and stabilize the errant pieces – which can be difficult. When such fractures require surgical fixation, they are described as being non-ambulatory (unable to move
When surgery is required for such a displaced or non-healing fracture – where the bone fragments have become separated ('wandering fragment') - two medical personnel are present: one holding an assistant's hand (adjudicator) to stabilize and support the dislocated shoulder blade, while another extends their arm over that part of the body in need.

Dislocation is an injury to any of the joints in your body that prevents motion and necessitates attention from a doctor; it brings great pain into the limbs associated with cold humors disturbing their proper position (movement). Here, medieval medical texts describe how dislocations—often caused by external forces leading to misalignment or immobility of joints due potentially to excess "cold humor" within body fluids as per Galenic theory—result in significant pain and require corrective measures. The term 'malaute' indicates something out-
When you acquire a dislocation (injury), then immediately intervene to make it return into place; however if not promptly addressed, the area will become numb and making correction thereafter becomes difficult due to affected sensation caused by delay in treatment as described here within medieval medical understanding. The text underscubs that timely intervention is crucial for effective reduction of a dislocation before complications like numbness occur; this aligns with contemporary medicine's emphasis on rapid response following such injuries, although the underlying explanatory framework would differ significantly from modern anatomical and physiological understanding.
Thus not covered or strapped in during the numbness phase of a dislocation, but motion continues to bring about cramps and sharp pains as stated herein; this indicates that movement after immobilization should be cautious if at all possible since doing so without proper care can result in further complications such as spasms or worsening pain. Here again there is a directive for careful handling of dislocations, resonating with present

So dislocated the jaws if not tightened; and this displacement of both is one of two types: either it's a mild spasm from their locations due to minimal intervention, which are slightly soothed with a little treatment, or it’s completely dislocated and combined (entirely), wherein they must be gently massaged at the joint until saliva rises from beneath them; in this state, the tongue of him/her is wrapped around his/her word.

Mostly it is a dislocation and displacement outside of the joints that trouble them, primarily in those parts where flesh (tissue) is thin, they are dislocated; perhaps also in those areas with muscle contractions causing exit from these conditions due to difficulty.
And when the patient suffers from acidity through palpation or manipulation and their muscle is paralyzed due to apoplasmatic conditioning, they are rubbed accordingly with appropriate treatment measures already applied previously.

If the uterus becomes loose, then where there is another cause that holds it up, when such a thing happens, it can easily be returned to its place; therefore, caution must be taken not to lose sight of what causes this condition so that one may correct and restore it.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another reduction method is as follows: lay a long staff with its head protruding on which it takes shape like a mortise-tenon joint, and ensure that neither side nor end are too thick or thin; place your hold above the knee of where you have fixed the stock, keep the leg therein pressed firmly at all times. Extend your arm towards the other part for strengthening purposes as well so when they meet again due to swift movement it will return quickly back in its proper position.
If reduction of it is difficult for all the reasons mentioned above, then use this treatment method: grasp a staff with its length equivalent to two arm'thy and thrust from that point at an angle as follows according to this formulation:

Apply the limb to this preparation, attach it firmly around the waist of the patient, secure in place without causing discomfort; let rest for several days until not bloated or swollen at its site anymore after seven days.
When food from excess of melancholy is stopped and the body member becomes comfortable, then healing comes to him.
Return (or return) the food is given greater importance and it should be actively engaged in some form of motion; therefore, if one becomes firm and does not soften, they are already healing.
May it be that if the joint is dislocated due to moisture or another cause, then in that case three kinds of treatments are administered as described in the book on treatments.
If all this pain and swelling are present for seven days without relief from the bandage or constriction, they continue to be applied occasionally, reducing spasms in some places; you understand that these are the patient's nerves, which lie at the top of the muscle, either contracted or stretched out/smoothed over.
When the dislocation of that which is causing pain in the chest and thighs occurs due to forceful push and extension movements within them, it should be reduced there by applying pressure until return (to normal position).

Capitol .xxvii." translates as follows: "In Chapter xxvii., it is understood that the hip joint when dislocated presents difficulty and appearance; moreover, if it has been displaced entirely in all parts, especially behind, where one cannot bend their arm nor touch them according to how they are dislocated. When you adjust a hips (dislocated) out of place as aligned with each form that the hip is positioned when misaligned, this act itself manifests it clearly; for then the joint becomes concave and no longer capable of flexing one's arm or touching oneself.
When you find the hernia (cox), then reduce it as much now so that he can recover from cautery surgery; if there is already an incision made for cautery, its reduction will be difficult and not fully heal completely unless at all times behind where other species of dislocation occur with greater pain and intermittent exertions towards the location causing death.
And when restoration is possible, it is that the body of the patient be extended with hands and arms spread outwards, and the doctor' extricates his/her fingers from between their thighs and knees (or palm), pressing back into place to restore its position.
If the dislocation is in the parts ahead (towards you), then return it by bending your arm where it enters into contact with its own hand'dictated touchpoint on their palm.
If dislocation does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and motion forcefully.
When two ministers stretch out their arms, they hold them thus that nothing is pulled away from it (by extension).
And return its arm turned entirely, placing a long cloth or bandage over the area, holding it for him/her.
When the doctor touches the joint, apply some oil to it so that those causes which help in its lubrication are provided for; and strengthen the joint by forcefully pressing until it returns (to normal function).
Here the reduction of his condition is carried out over that layer where he has stiffness and effusion in the joint space affected by albuminous humors exuded from inflammation within the stricture channel, with his arm hanging from the collarbone, resting on pillows for several days.
And if it is necessary for him/her (the patient) to be unseated, and if the joint formation occurs at that place, then cut or release the ligament there, and apply such treatment as required.
If you see the joint not strained, then apply the plaster and bandage repeatedly for several days until it retracts; also remove that.
If you apply weight to the reduction of the joint and its position is in motion, then administer moisture together with heat delicately, as soon as it has adjusted; or pause over the movement fatty flesh (perhaps a hernia), so that pressure on the area can prevent protrusion throughout the day and night. Return that and put it in the bath; when bubbling (steam or vapor), rub on that joint which is stiffened by cold due to movement, one application for this state of being rheumatic, another after a rest day, and the third after three days.

Capitol .xxviii. (Note: Without additional context or understanding of medieval
In the care for displacement injuries, it is at the joint between the arm and body that attention must be given.
When some of the humors are displaced and reduction (setting back) of dislocation is difficult, it may be contrary to other joints; however, if rapid return in place when shifted occurs now, then setting down or immediate apposition wax must happen therein.
The reduction of the dislocation is that you stop the joint'dicted by its cavity in a table and extend it from there; let your doctor or hand rest on the imminent juncture, and push it back into place until returned to its location.
Even if it is considered that the palm rests on the stomach of her/him, then have pressure applied to both sides of her/his body using a table meant for extension and reduction; and if dislocation precedes, position them so their body lies over that inherent structure placed upon the table, ensuring the doctor's hand covers this imminent joint.
Therefore if it returns quickly, all good; but if not, that part will harden and become inflexible until those days are past. Do not interfgy the reduction of your patient's limb anymore unless necessary.
Even though the joint' extrication follows its curvature; and there is no cause in the malady, but rather it becomes milder due to treatment with instruments for intervention at this location—and you understand that the nerves are twisted or sprained herein not through external causes (like pressure), but because they have become stiffened from such instrumentation.
So when they return (from the treatment), their pause is placed on what we have dressed them in, and are laid down for days; meanwhile, it's cut off and its dressing was exercised.
May it be that if the patient' extruding movement is stagnant and causes pain in them or their belly area, then apply water poultice therein and warm fumigations for some days until heated up to normal state, allowing him to evacuate.

May enter through castration or percussion or seemingly towards them; they have already learned the ways of treatment in eloquent speech, which may return to proficiency; and if there is a need to release what escapes from it (perhaps referring to fluids), then do so quickly because of their proximity to understanding. Here enter by castration or tapping/striking or seemingly directed towards them; they have learned the methods of treatment in eloquent speech, which may return back into proficiency; and if there is a need to release what escapes (possibly referring to retained fluids), then do so quickly due to their close connection with understanding.
From those things it is not healed but that which you apply directly in the water they recommend.
It is that the humidity (malaute) spreads over their face above the chest from below, and it extends rapidly through breathing such as to not expose their chest.

Here the minister extends a ligature to the part of the beam, and they should not be torn between the two beams or at their respective joints, though perhaps it is possible in our times as well.
The doctor holds their hands over the spine for strength to return it into place and adjusts them on the table while returning them in order that they may be stabilized again.
If it does not return through this form, take a table of which the length or width is three feet (approximately nine palms), and carve into the wall where we previously mentioned that the malady resides within its location in between the extremity of the table. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: E propõe-se a pausa na coluna da mesa sobre a espinha, e o médico fica com os pes no outro extremo, começando imediatamente que a coluna está constricta e volta ao seu lugar.
If you wish to bind the part that has been turned over on it; and you must stay with your head down at the base of the thighs below both shoulders between their lengths—which are each a span's length, plus another two staves above them for the top of the patient’s skull (and which already have servants holding his hands), there is one staff placed in between every stick; and it has become restrained within any such stick where you twist. And with each movement that turns your head, keep all four feet firmly planted on the ground so they do not stumble backward or cause dislocation of a joint.
And take a staff in which you will turn it on the two ends of the two staves.
In the limb there is a defect in which it forms its staff (referring to an inflamed joint or swolthy area), wherein its length resembles that of a palm, and in both other staves/joints similarly appear.

And return its ligature as we have mentioned beforehand, and place the humoral fluid inside it to heal.
If there is any sign of inflammation at the site during healing time, then apply medicines that moisten and cleanse for a long-term application on the treatment table as recommended; this has already been applied in that location with a layer of lime.

Of hinge joint injury treatment. (This translation is quite general, as the original Latin text doesn'thy
You understand that the hip joint and muscle connection is not merely bent but severely dislocated to such an extent as if you were also hurting other smaller body connections with their curved or concave nature, which are typically sensitive to injuries similar in kind elsewhere. (This translation interprets a medieval understanding of hinge-like hip joint and muscular structure interactions that have become significantly more complex today.)
E the joint of the wide is dislocated according to four ways, it can be dislocated in the parts above or below, forward or backward, or left and right sides.
Mostly it is dislocated at joints downwards and upwards or in between the parts therein (downward/upward movements of these body segments), scarcely elsewhere.
When the dislocation of his limb is at its parts it becomes long and hardened due to pressure applied on the healthy knee joint which in turn prevents further bending or movement, leading him here where he can place an apostometric cautery point for immobilization.
The translation of this line from medieval medical treatise into English would be as follows: The name by which that person who is in sprain has become displaced belongs to the accidents suffered therein; they are contrary to these injuries.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and when the dislocation is old and ancient, meaning it has already been addressed by whatever treatment you have administered so far, we cannot cure everything in that; hence there will be no miraculous healing. And now not to cover up any further symptoms with spices.
In that which the dislocation is recent and one of the four species of dislocation, then take up what has come down (the limb), restore its joint, extend it to the parts inside and outside, and return it both rightly and leftly; there will be no need for other treatments.
May it be that if the condition does not return in this manner, then those preparations you have made must act strongly and extend the cushion under your patient from where they were initially placed; or hold their hands firmly with a rope (or ligature) which is above said cushion. Another servant shall spread out that same bandage upwards to meet them there, ensuring proper contact of every layer as you proceed further along the leg until reaching the ankle and hand-holding steadily; while another attends closely by securing a rope (or ligature) tightly around the waistband.
When extension occurs from here or the division of the chest to the division of the breastbone (or vice versa), it is as if stretching towards these parts.
When all of them are stretched out for a while until the malady rises to its place on Earth and starts falling down,
This particular form of extension is characteristic throughout all four regions.
So if the detachment returns with water (meaning fluid or pus), take care of it quickly; otherwise, all necessary waters that we must speak about regarding its own cure are needed.
In the patient's own reduction, when dislocated, and displacement is to joints where the hernia lies above its groin; hold it with ligaments at that place between the top of the thigh and where bones join together (the jawbone), extending the ligament on either side of the shoulder blade part.
And send another minister with strong pulsation to the arms of him/her, and press down firmly on the hollowness of his/her thighs extending forcefully to expel strongly back into its place. (Here we are assuming "le sieu loc" refers to where something was previously displaced in a medical context.)
This specific substance is of milky white healing quality with which this limb becomes reduced, that other such essences do not possess.
May you rest on me and not disobey this special healing care for all, provided that the two feet of the thigh are firmly bound together by ropes at both knees and ankles.
Whenever any part of the body has a length corresponding to four digits (which would be roughly equivalent to two hand spans), and when the thigh extends as much as three fingers, it is observed in such cases:
Return (or position) the hump onto the head of the staff, so that it is on its place; and let the length of this person from the ground be equivalent to two cubits.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Appoint a strong young man to reduce the head of the hernia, and have another youth suspended above it; let this other boy apply pressure on the fortified place until the hernial juncture returns to its proper location quickly.
In the reduction itself, when it dislocates to the outside part of the body (the hip), where the hump protrudes over the buttock following our compression recommendations in the hips' jelly-like state; and its sinews are placed precisely on the affected hollow and chest.
Here comes the sentence to translate:
Each minister extends to his/her portion and the doctor holds their hand for reduction according to the art.
When dislocation occurs in the lower body parts, then it is time to change positions; as for this treatment method described by the doctor, he places his right hand on the lumbar region of the patient's waist and adjusts that position with the palm of his other hand. He pauses there momentarily while moving the hands over each other until reaching a new posture at once after dislocation in these body parts occurs.
If the dislocation is at the parts behind, do not cover that the hump has extended to the parts below and stands on the ground; they have a covering over hard causes wherein it lies down if its waistbone (the pelvis) is also dislocated from those parts, as we mentioned above. There should be no pain in this situation according to what we've said before.
When compression is applied with a tablet at the location where pain occurs in the joint,
So when the reduction is completed as directed – and "the term for reducing it" (which refers to some form of treatment or therapy) does not concern you, because from your hips downwards, extend cushions under them; once those pads are in place, adjust screws/buttons on each pad so that the hip socket is expanded and allows movement without discomfort – then with these settings properly placed for stability (and ensuring the thigh does not become stiff or rigid), securely fasten bands around it to hold pressure; leave this arrangement in place for three days, possibly four.
Return the sinew and bandage back into place, comparing one cushion with another.
And if you see those hinges open in the womb (uterus), then you understand that the displacement has already been fixed, and thus send the uterus downwards.
If you see any cause for suppuration, then return and apply dressing to that area according to your first treatment methodology, and leave it in place for three days.
Return that item, and let it take time for walking over such distances until they are comfortable.

Concerning the care for joint displacement." This line indicates a focus on medical attention required when there's an issue related
The joint is dislocated according to three kinds: it can be displaced from the limbs' parts ahead of time or at any moment, and even behind them when present; but as for those that are not currently dislocated." This text segment describes various scenarios in which a joint might become dislocated. It details where these occurrences may happen—in front (anterior), anywhere along the line of limbs' parts ("partidas" referring to segments or regions within the arm and/dicts, such as wrist, elbow, forearm etc.), behind them (posteriorly) when present in some cases. It also clarifies
The sign of a joint being displaced is that the doctor instructs the leech to apply its cushion (camba) on the hip area; heed well, because the joint has been dislocated." Here, it advises immediate action when signs point towards potential or actual joint displacement. The use of a leech for applying pressure with its own body is mentioned as part of medieval treatments to potentially relocate (manipulate) an improperly position
The restoration of all these maneuvers is that you must firmly press the doctor's foot (leech), possibly extending it over there; attach your hands to his body, placing them on top of him where he applies pressure with its cushion if possible—this refers to a leech application. Keep holding both feet together underneath while also securing that joint between these two points firmly in place (possibly using belts or straps). Then take another servant and extend the doctor's foot within them, establishing strength around it as part of keeping the dislocated joint stable—and furthermore having an additional person stretch out their body inside whereby ensuring that once more displaced has returned to its original position.
The translation of the medieval medical treatise line by line into English is as follows:
Here's the line by line translation:
And do not use the humors of walking for more than a few days until it is healed and comforted.
If your reduction of the body is considered sufficient for you, then apply strong extension on the ligaments which were previously described in the treatment of the hip joint.
Given that "Capitol" is not an actual line from your provided
The phrase you've given, "Curacio di la dislocacio del talo," appears to be Italian and translates into English
The phrase translates to English as: "Sometimes the ankle is remargued for small adjustments, and sometimes it's dislocated at joint divisions or in other parts." This sentence describes situations where minor interventions might be applied (such as gentle movements) if there are slight misalignments of the talus bone within a joint. However, more severe displacements may require additional attention to specific areas such as around tendons and ligaments attached at those points for correct alignment or treatment:
When it is said that someone has had their leg fractured, they have been displaced from the place where they were broken off.
May healing of the patient be through gentle release and ease in movement, so that it can return within these conditions.
When treating the patient upon dislocation as per complement, make sure to straighten out their hips and hold that limb with a strong and worthy servant from behind at the hip joint'thy location.
And place yourself at the head of the patient'thy body below their upper limb (head), and also your left side with respect to the lower part of the patient’s body in the location of the abdomen-cavity.
Return the leg to your left hand for three times, and return it with both hands twice, holding onto the chest where the thigh' extrusion needs five beats of work from its pump (the heart).
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When he forces his fingers into place in the soft cushion and you are at the base or foundation (belly), respectively.
So if he returns on the fifth day or in two more days of this treatment and his foot is swolthy (swollen), all good things well; but otherwise, repeat the operation again until he comes back.
May you be prohibited from reducing the humors that have been recommended by us; then your malady will complain between your thighs on the ground and a closed bedcloth must cover it, ensuring that nothing escapes through those spaces in your legs where we've already covered with cloth.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: The minister of his tongue holds their thighs together, and another minister extends either the leg or the ligament that lies over the chest area; this minister is extended against the patient' extrusion part, so that it does not escape from its parts.
And the doctor straightens the displacement with his hands and another minister holds the healthy hip joints until the displacement returns to ease of movement.
So when the dislocation is returned and it's declared to you that there has been restoration of its reduction, then immobilize and tightly bandage that joint with strong adhesive tape, binding the foot to the cushion.
When you fear or protect the tendons behind which are on the foot, to ensure that the ligaments over it do not become violent and lead astray:
Return that thing for two or three days, and if the ligament becomes soothed, extend it outwardly.
Return those parts of it back to its cavity today or tomorrow, and prevent the humid from entering for forty days. May it not be said that if the patient goes further into this space, there will certainly be no guarantee of stability for his displacement and he won'thy receive medical care anymore.
If you administer an astringent poultice on the wound where we previously described it in our account of care and bandaging, let it be until it is swelled out (i.dict: perhaps inflamed or puffed up).

Given the fragment "Curaci de dislocacio dels ditz dels pes," which appears to be a medieval medical text in Latin,
The provided line seems to translate as follows: "Treatment for that which is dislocated should involve a little extension of the limb in question; and if it's not difficult, break them loose." Here we can interpret this advice from an ancient medical perspective with modern understanding. The treatment appears rudimentary but suggests manipulating or gently stretching (extending) the affected joint to reduce dislocation – commonly known today as
The fragment translates to: "If the dislocation is in the knee joint of one's foot, then you should cover it with a poultice on top of its sole or over a table while remaining as still as possible." In historical medical practice, this suggests applying heat and pressure using natural materials like plant-based salves (poultices) to reduce pain and inflammation. The application in the context might involve placing warmth directly onto an affected joint – which aligns with some contemporary approaches of localized temperature therapy for discomfort relief though it lacks modern medical practices' precision
This line translates to: "Hold the position of your feet and pause above where you imagine are located at joints; apply a plaster there for those with tendons in their shins, so that it remains over while returning them until they grip again without appearing on display." This advice appears from an ancient medical standpoint focused on manual therapy techniques to address issues like weakened or injured connective tissues (tendons) around the foot joints. The goal seems to be repositioning and supporting these tendons, potentially in cases of sprains or other soft-tissue injuries – a concept echoed today when using taping methods for stabilization during healing periods after acute muscul
Return the belly of his body into its cavity, and apply pressure on that area with a board which expands entirely over the body; place another cushion above it to rest for three days until he is well-rested and recovered in terms of health (his physical condition).

When any cause of it arises and you pierce through the cure as well as in its restoration, success is guaranteed to prevent death.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And so now you must make for it (the reduction) in the common place of its cause, thus preventing an abscess from forming at this point.
And when the limb returns as we administer this regime that expels putrefaction and cares for what comes up from drying ointments,
If dislocation is present and there are signs of bone fracture separation in the affected areas, then apply their respective splints to them, making sure they have contact with each other as described for simple humoral disturbandictions within those locations previously mentioned by doctors.
