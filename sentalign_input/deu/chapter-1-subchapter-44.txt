Chapter Forty-Four:
On the cauterization for gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And so, when gout caused by cold is treated with a method of care and the pain is not removed, then cauterization is used.
And you cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And it should be olive-shaped cauterization, which is as follows:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
And if the pain moves to the knees or other joints, which often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries, covering the entire area with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize and do not press too hard with the cautery, just around the thickness of the skin.
And if the pain moves to the knee and back, then apply the cautery we have mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pain is only in the hands, called chiragra, then puncture around the joints, making two lines.
And if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture around the joints on each knuckle and on the thumb of the hand.
And if the pain moves to the elbows or muscles after a few days, then cauterize each part of the arms.
And do not evacuate the patient from a good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and phlegm is evacuated with this cautery, they will be healed, God willing.
