On the treatment of broken bones when they are restored crookedly and inhibit their proper function.	On the treatment of fractured bones when they mend crooked and are inhibited from their proper functioning.	0.9601604
When it happens that a healed limb becomes crooked or prominent at the broken bone and swelling, and the shape of the limb is thus altered, but the limb is not inhibited from its natural function, you should not take the word of someone who thinks the limb is newly broken.	When a limb that has been set has some distortion after healing, or the bone that was broken has some prominence or callosity, so that the limb is deformed, but there is nevertheless no limitation of its natural movement, then you should not listen to those who think that the bone should be broken again.	0.769962
But there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land; and this operation is very blameworthy, causing great fear, the sign of which is deadly.	In our parts there have been many ignorant doctors and bone-setters who have done this. The operation is most blameworthy and leads to great dangers, death itself not being the worst possibility.	0.73144966
But if the crookedness and swelling are recent, then they should be treated with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, mallow, and similar ones; and a poultice should be made with a softening plaster like well-made dyallachilon; or marshmallow root mucilage mixed with hen's fat or cerate oil, and applied as a plaster; or fatty figs mashed with pigeon dung, and similar medicinal substances that are named for consolidating.	But if the distortion and callosity be recent you should massage it with an infusion of the herbs that have an emollient quality, such as leaves and roots of the marsh mallow, and melilot and the like: and apply one of the emollient plasters such as carefully prepared diachylon. Or take mucilage of the root of the marsh mallow and beat it up with chicken fat and oil of sesame, and let a cataplasm of these be applied. Or take a fat fig and beat it up with pigeon's dung; and the like remedies that are termed 'inhibitors of scarring'.	0.89338374
And sometimes it is resolved with frequent gentle rubbing with wet hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times.	Sometimes also the callosity is resolved by long-continued gentle friction with the hands; and constant movement in every direction should also be applied.	0.7944701
But if the crookedness has advanced and become hard and turned into a bony mass, and it needs surgical treatment, then the top layer must be scraped off and the continuity of the bone disrupted, and the excess swelling of the bone itself should be incised with fine instruments, and this should be done with care and diligence.	But if the deformity be long-standing and fixed and hardened and you are compelled to treat it operatively, you will have to cut down on it from above, and free the junction of the bone, and with fine chisels cut away the redundant callus or bone; be gentle in this, with diligence and care.	0.784256
