Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I have completed for you, O Sons, this book which is the last in medicine with its complement, and reached the end of it through its expositions and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of practice, that is, surgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since the practice by hand is fallen in our region and our time, it has been entirely neglected; perhaps its science has perished, and its trace has been cut off, and nothing remains of it except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which hands have changed: and error and confusion happened to them until their intentions were closed, and their power was withdrawn. It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise on it according to the way of position, declaration, and abbreviation; and that I should come with forms of cautery instruments and other tools of work: as is done by the addition of declaration, and by hastening what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why a good practitioner of it with his hand is not found in this our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen has described, until he knows the supports of members, and their forms, and their conjunction, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their exit, and of pulsating and quiet veins, and the exits of them.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And because of this, Hippocrates said: "A name with a name is much, and with work it is little, especially in the art of hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 But we have already spoken about that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Because the one who is not knowledgeable about what we have said regarding anatomy does not evacuate himself, so that he might fall into error, by which men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who profess to be experts in this science and boast about it without knowledge and without experimentation.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 What happened was that I saw a foolish doctor cut into a scrofulous swelling on a woman's neck and he cut some of the arteries in the neck, so blood flowed from the woman until she died in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 And I saw another doctor who dared to extract a stone from an old man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 So he came to him and extracted it along with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And indeed I was already called to extract it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 And I saw another doctor who was receiving a payment from a certain Duke of our land on account of his medicine; and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him that he broke his leg near the ankle. And the doctor hurried with his ignorance and bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and strong straps, and did not leave the wound room for breathing.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he released him according to his own desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Afterwards he sent him away for some days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage; and it stayed like that until his leg became swollen, and also his foot, and it reached a fatal end.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 So I was called to him, and I hurried to loosen the bandage; and there followed peace, and he escaped from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 Nevertheless, corruption had already taken hold in the limb; and I could not stop it.  /> I have translated the text as requested, without any notes or changes to all caps. If you need any further assistance, please let me know.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Therefore, cease walking on the affected limb until it heals.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another physician who punctured a cancerous abscess; and after several days it became an ulcer, until its evil increased greatly with the master himself.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 That is, because when it is pure cancer from black bile, then one should not approach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate it, so that its entirety may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And because of that, O my sons, it is necessary for you to know that the surgical procedure is divided into two parts: namely, the procedure associated with health; and the procedure which carries danger in many conditions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already pointed out in every place in this book where an operation occurs that is accompanied by fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and to avoid it, so that the foolish do not find a way to speak and bring shame.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Therefore, receive the measure with diligence and prudence, and treat your patients with gentleness and firmness, and use the better path that leads through God's grace to health and praiseworthy success; and abandon terrible diseases of difficult cure; and lift up your spirits from what makes you afraid, so that hesitation may not come upon you in your faith and advantage.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it is more becoming to your glory, and more exalted in this world, and finally, it is more profitable for you.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 For Galen has already said in some of his warnings.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not treat evil diseases, lest you be called an evil physician.  />
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 But now I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	 Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 On Cautery with Fire and Cautery with Sharp Medicine, arranged and organized from head to foot, and on the shapes of the instruments and tools for cautery, and on everything necessary for the procedure.
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter Two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 About the cutting and piercing, bloodletting and cupping, wounds, extraction of arrows and similar things: and all the chapters are arranged according to the forms of the instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter Three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 About restoration and dislocation, and the cure of twisting, and similar things: a chapter arranged from head to toe and according to the forms of the instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be the glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 ¶ About Help and Harm of Cautery: and in which tempers it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold.
Caput I.	 Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 But before remembering its use, it is necessary to say the quality of its benefit and harm, and in which temperament it is given.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 I say therefore that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of cautery and its harm is a lengthy and subtle scientific discourse, and an obscure secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Even many wise men have spoken about it and differed on the subject, and for me a little of their speech is enough, fearing prolongation. xspace
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 I say therefore that cautery benefits every temperament, which is with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments which are the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 But in the temperament which is hot and dry with matter they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 For some said that cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others said the opposite of this, namely that cautery is not suitable for an illness caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat, and it is inappropriate to heal a hot and dry illness with something hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who speaks against it says: that cautery provides a benefit in every warm and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, for when you compare the body of a human and its humors to the composition of fire, you find the body of a man to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I indeed say through his words: because experience has already revealed this to me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 But it is not right that anyone come to this, except one who has already been proven and trained in the last chapter of cautery exercise, and knows the diversity of human complexions, and the nature of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and their symptoms, and their duration.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 But concerning other complexions, there is no fear over you; especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 For all doctors have agreed upon them; and they did not disagree on the benefit of cautery for them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, my children, that from the secret of treatment with cautery with fire and its goodness is greater than cautery with burning medicine; for fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member that is being cauterized; and it does not harm another member connected with it, except with a small injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 But the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the members; and perhaps it causes an illness of difficult healing in the member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, except if it is too much. ››
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 Indeed, that has become clear to us through experience, due to the length of our service and study with this art, and our adherence to the truth of things; and because of that, I am free from the length of discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not permitted to my book, I would present to you the secret hidden in fire and the nature of its operation in expelling bodies, which by means of philosophical demonstrative speech, would cure you of your illnesses.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know that they disagree on the time when it is suitable to perform a cautery, and they prefer the vernal season.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that a cautery is suitable at any time; because the harm which occurs due to the season is overwhelmed by the benefit which is drawn from the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if the cautery is for necessary, strong, and urgent pains which do not allow delay; because one fears from them that a greater harm may occur than a slight injury caused by the season.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And do not let this thought enter your minds, O sons, that only the common and foolish physicians think thus: namely, that the illness which is cured by cautery does not always return; and they put forward this consequence, but it is not as they suppose: because cautery is not anything other than a medicine which alters the complexion and dries up the humors which are the causes of the pains.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 Nevertheless, cautery surpasses medicine in the speed of its action and the strength of its operation and the intensity of its dominion; and it is possible for the illness to return at some time according to the complexion of the patient and the location of his illness and its strength; and what is prepared in his body from an accumulation of superfluous humors in him; and what comes to him in acquiring them from foods and similar causes, unless the illness for which cautery is administered occurs.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle illness in a member with few superfluities and moistures, such as tooth cautery for pain and similar cases, it is possible that the pain will not return there.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 "But that happens rarely.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 "But the common belief is again that the cautery is the last resort of medicine; this is the correct view, not as they themselves intend it: because they believe that there is no treatment that can be compared to medicine, nor to anything else after the cessation of the cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 "The truth is contrary to that belief and the intent behind it, namely that cautery is the last resort of medicine; it is not, except when we apply methods of treatment for some ailments and they do not work, then we finally apply cautery and it works. Then it follows that cautery is the last resort of treatment, not in the sense that the common people and many foolish doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 "The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they only said this because of the evenness of gold and its high quality; and they said that the site of the cautery does not form pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 "But this is not absolutely true, for I have already tested it and found that it does not do so in certain bodies without other factors.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 "And cautery with gold itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 "However, when you apply the cautery fire made of gold into the fire, it does not indicate to you how much heat is generated according to your will because of the redness of gold; and when it becomes very hot, if you add more fire to it, it melts in the fire and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 "Therefore, the artisan falls short due to that; and because of it, cautery with iron is quicker and more convenient among us for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 "And indeed I have already arranged this chapter on cautery according to sections, and I have arranged them from head to foot; so that those who seek something specific may find it more easily.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 On how to cauterize the head at the hairline.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 This cauterization serves to control moisture and cold over the brain: these two are causes of catarrh and an excess of humors flowing from the head to the eyes and ears, as well as excessive sleep, toothache, and sore throat. And universally, every illness that occurs from cold, such as paralysis, catarrh, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is as follows: advise the patient to first cleanse the head with a cleansing medicine for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habit of the patient.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then have him sit before you facing eastward, placing his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with an ink pen.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then heat the cautery with olive oil. This is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then place it on the marked spot with an ink pen, and gradually lower your hand until you turn it over.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then quickly lift your hand and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that the bone is already exposed to the size of a lentil or cumin seed, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, repeat with the same iron or another if it cools down, until you see the bones I mentioned to you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and wet a piece of cotton with it, then place it on the spot, and leave it there for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place a cloth soaked in butter over it, and leave it there until the fire scab is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it with tetraphylax ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 They have already said that the more the wound remains open, the more pus it emits: therefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone: and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then after that which has been burnt from the bone, it should be scraped, then cleaned out.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 And others say that it is necessary to reach the very end with the cautery until it imprints on the bone the mark of the instrument known as kirate, or the small alphabetical device which women use. They believe that from this place the vapors of the head are expelled and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then it should be cleaned out until it heals.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 To me, however, these two kinds of cautery do not seem altogether suitable except for certain people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And to leave it is, in my opinion, better with regard to the patient's health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 For the head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity, as we have shown for other members; and especially when the head of a sick person is naturally weak. The first kind of cautery seems to me more wholesome and better, and I use it. Therefore, operate with it in health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing the head for pain throughout the entire head.
Caput III.	 Chapter 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When a chronic pain occurs throughout the entire head and is prolonged in the patient, using leeches, cupping, purgatives, oils, and enemas.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And especially if it has already been cauterized with one of the irons that we mentioned, and nothing else benefits it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 For if the head of the patient is of strong constitution and not weak, and it finds intense cold: then cauterize with another iron beneath that one.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize the same over every horn of his head with an iron, so that it does not penetrate the skin, and a quantity of bone is exposed, as we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And cauterize him with one iron in the occiput of his head, in a place called the vessel, and it is the place where the windpipe is placed. And lift up your hand in this, and you will not expose bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For the patient will find intense pain from that, and it is different from the pain of all other head cauteries.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I call this cautery "in its place": and it ought to be a finer iron than that with which the horns of the head and the back of the head are cauterized, compared to the iron with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 § On the manner of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with burning medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When pain and swelling occur in any part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is evacuated with purifying medicines, and the rest of the treatment, as I said in the divisions of diseases, does not help entirely: then cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp burning medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 But cauterization with a sharp burning medicine is done as follows: take one tooth of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then cut the place of pain with a wide phlebotomy needle until there is a space under the skin where the tooth can be held.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then insert it under the skin until it is hidden; then bind over it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for fifteen hours; then remove it, and extract the garlic clove, and leave the wound open for two or three days; then place a cotton ball soaked in butter over it until pus forms in the area; then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to make that with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth chapter on Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 The cauterization of it with iron is done in this way:
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 Cautery Iron, the shape of which is this:
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 And it is called "nail-shaped" because the shape of its head is like that of a nail, which has some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small projection.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the spot and hold your hand steady; and turn the iron slowly but quickly; and let the quantity that is burned be half the thickness of the skin.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And raise your hand so that the artery below is not burned and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then soak a cotton ball in salt water and place it on the spot and leave it for three days; then place a cotton ball with butter; afterwards, treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, cauterize this semi-skull with the point of a second scalpel.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 And be careful not to cut the artery in this semi-skull, which is not old.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 On the method of cauterizing an old semi-skull.
Caput V.	 Chapter Five
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When treating hemicrania, along with what we have said in the preceding treatment and in the division of diseases, if the treatment does not help: you see from the disease that what has been said about cautery first with medicine or with cautery using fire is not enough. Then it is necessary to burn a surgical cautery until it whitens after marking the location of pain with a line whose length is half a finger or thereabouts. And place your hand in its place, and tighten it until you cut the artery, and reach the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to burn the side or the nerve that moves the jaw during chewing, so that a spasm does not occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And take care and caution against bleeding from the cut artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 For its incision is dangerous, especially for one who does not know how to do it and is not diligent or experienced, and he abandons the procedure first of all.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I will make amends by recalling the method to control bleeding that occurs from the artery, in its proper place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 But if you see from the disease that this cautery is not sufficient and you see that the patient's body can withstand cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, cure the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on extracting an artery with a two-bladed cautery.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 For this cauterization is better and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 § On the method of cauterizing ear pain. ¶
Caput VI.	 Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When ear pain occurs due to cold and is treated with solutions and other treatments as we have said in the division, and the pain does not go away, then burn a cautery called "Point," whose form is this:
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then make marks around it after its burning on the whole circumference of the ear; or around both if the pain is simultaneous in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And draw back the Cautery from the root of the ear after you have marked the places with Encaut; and let the quantity of the Cautery be ten pricks in each ear, and thus.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then care for the places until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 ¶ On the manner of Cautery in Torture.
Caput VII.	 Chapter Seven.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 Torture which is treated with Cautery is only from species that occur due to Phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And avoid Cautery for the species which occurs from dryness and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When you treat this species of Torture with emetics, purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary to Cauterize the sick person with three Cauteries: one at the root of the ear, a second a little lower than its tympanum, and a third at the junction of the two lips. 
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And place your Cautery opposite to the affected side.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Because softening occurs only in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the method of Cautery is that you should Cauterize it directly at the tip of the upper part of the ear, a little under the horn of the head; and another in the tympanum, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And withdraw your hand with the Cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the method of Cautery and it is a species from the knife whose shape has been described before; however, it is not very subtle, as you see: and the knife should be slightly thicker than necessary.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then care for the places with what preceded, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 Of the manner of cauterizing in an old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter 8
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When the apoplexy becomes old and you have treated it with what we said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each corner of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and a cautery on the back of the head, according to what preceded: and the manner of cauterizing should be according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Also he is cauterized with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach: and this is more final.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then let him be treated with what preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	 Of the manner of cauterizing in oblivion.
Caput IX.	 Chapter 9
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 It is necessary that in the first place they give the sick man large doses of hyena and pills that purify the brain. ︎
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then shave the head of the sick man entirely, and place on his nape an emplaster made from mustard, as described in the treatise on emplasters: and apply it several times. ︎ ︎
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 For this itself is the manner of cautery: and do it according to the same order that I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If therefore he is healed by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not, then make for him three cauteries on the back of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and put between each cautery the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then care for the cauteries with what preceded.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If however you wish to add to it, and the patient can bear it: then make a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 If you wish to add to it: then cauterize him on both corners. ︎ ︎
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then care for him until he is healed; and let the cautery be oiled according to the aforementioned shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	 The method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.
Caput X.	 Chapter 10.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	 It is necessary that you proceed with the cleansing of the head using honey and as we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 Then shave the head of the patient; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over each horn of the head, and with a cautery over its posterior, and three times over the nape of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 But if you need to soften the body with more of those remedies, and the patient is strong enough, and the disease is severe; then cauterize him with four cauteries over the nape of the neck, and the last one until it burns a lot from his skin, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then care for him until he is healed; and thus oil the cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 The method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 Chapter 11.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 An epileptic is not cauterized except one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with honey and the other treatment which we have said in the division; when the patient is large or strong in taking medicine. ‌
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 But if he is a child who does not tolerate medicine, then give him gargle and brain-cleansing chews for many days beforehand with the improvement of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then shave his head; afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, as it was said before in the method; and with another cautery on his nape, and over each horn of his head with a cautery. ‌ ‌
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 But if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned for the one having paralysis, and soften his body over the nape of the neck and the nape of the back; and let the cautery be oiled according to the aforementioned method. ‌ ‌ ‌
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	 If however the patient is a child, then place a fine cautery in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	 § On how to cauterize in cases of melancholy.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	 When the cause of melancholy is due to corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize with the same cauteries we mentioned for those with paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melancholy is due to superfluous humors tending towards black bile, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, as was previously mentioned in the division. Then shave the head of the patient, and afterwards make a neatly shaped torus from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it in the middle of the head, and let the patient sit upright, held on all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Then presently apply an ointment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 And it is best made from old mutton fat. xspace
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	 And warm the ointment over a moderate fire, so that when a finger is inserted into it, it will be comfortable to the touch.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	 Then evacuate it onto the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools down.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	 Do this for the patient once every week, along with his other good dietary practices, until he is cured. xspace 3
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	 Or if you wish, you can cauterize him by making many small punctures on it, except that you should hold the hand with the cautery; indeed, let it be smelling.  xspace 1 3
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	 For this type of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	 Then place over it a piece of cloth soaked in butter or chicken fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	 § On how to cauterize when water flows into the eye.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	 When the beginning of water in the eye is indicated to you by the signs that I mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient a drink that will cleanse his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And keep him from all moistures, and have him sit in a bath while fasting for several days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then cauterize him on both temples with two cauteries, if there is an attempt at water descending into both eyes together; or from one side only, if there is an attempt at water descending into one eye only; and cut out with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin. And let the cauteries be long in the breadth of the temples. And take care to avoid blood flow.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 If you see anything from him, then cut it out immediately with whatever medicine is possible. And I come with wisdom, which is in the drawing out of the arteries and their cutting off, and care to avoid blood flow.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	 And when he is cauterized on the neck, under the two bones, with two cauteries fully extended.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	 On the method of cauterizing old tears.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 When the tears of the eyes are chronic and persistent, lying over the veins and arteries that are on the exterior surface of the head, it is verified that this is from cold and phlegmatic superfluities. Then cauterize with the same cautery as I have described for water descending into the eyes, in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on both temples, and two cauteries on the neck under the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if you need an additional measure, then cauterize him on every side of the eye, on the outer edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery. ️
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	 On the method of cauterizing bad smell from the nose.

Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	 When you are treating this, with what we have said concerning division, and the treatment is not helpful: then hasten and give him weak broth to drink for three nights; then shave his head, and cauterize him with a medium-sized cautery, with an olive cautery.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	 Then cauterize it with two cautery irons, over the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	 And beware of the artery, lest you cut it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	 And this is the shape of the clavicle cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	 § On the method of cauterizing for softening the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	 When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery iron, using this lunar cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if you wish, cauterize it slightly over the two eyebrows with two cautery irons in every part, and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not complete your hand with the cautery, rather according to the amount that the third eyelid is burnt. 
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	 And this is the shape of the cautery according to this method of the lunar cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 § On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the lashes are turned inward, pricking the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 The cautery for this is done in two ways: either with a hot cautery, or with a cautery that has been prepared with burning medicine.    
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 In the case of the hot cautery, before that, instruct the patient to let his lashes grow, if he is one who cleans them, until they are lengthened and evened out.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 But if they prick him at their roots, then bind his eyes with a ribbon so that they do not move until they grow out.       
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 So when they grow out and are evened, then place the patient's head in your lap; then mark the eyelid of his eye with encaustic, making a mark that is shaped like a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the lashes.       
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then apply the soaked linen cloth on egg white or psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then heat the cautery iron, which looks like this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize gradually on the area you have marked in many sessions until the surface of the skin, which is shaped like a myrtle leaf, becomes completely visible.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And the sign of health for your work is this: if you see the eyelid contracting and the hairs around the eye rising at the point where it was pierced.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Raise your hand then, and let him rest for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then place a linen cloth with butter over it until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with an ointment until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 But if any hair returns after an hour and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that spot as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 But if the hairs are below, then cauterize them until they lift to their natural place and are equal so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	 On how to cauterize with a burning medicine in this case.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 Instruct the patient to let the hairs grow out and become equal.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make the shape of a myrtle leaf from paper cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take known soap and unwetted lime, one ounce each or thereabouts, then grind them together well, and make this mixture quickly so that it does not cool down.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then spread this mixture over the paper leaf shape you made and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And place a linen cloth soaked in egg white under the eye, and let the patient's head rest on your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 You shall move it as often as the patient feels the biting of the medicine, for its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While he continues to feel the biting of this medicine, then release the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When the biting ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 And see then, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised when contracted by fire or by cutting, it is good. And if not, then repeat on that same place from the medicine in the area where the medicine does not press and does not darken, until your treatment becomes equal and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then apply to it kohl with butter, until the skin of the burn is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with diaphanic ointment or another, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 And it is necessary for you during the treatment that you carefully watch so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid becomes soft after a few days and something bothers the eye from the hairs, then repeat the medicine on that place of the eyelid which is becoming soft specifically, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore, according to this, let your consideration be; and the way of righteousness is not hidden from him who studies this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 ¶ On how to cauterize the lacrimal duct.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When you treat the fistula with what we have said about the divisions of diseases and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cauterize it in this way.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Tell the patient to place his head in your lap, and let the assistant hold the patient's head between his hands so that it does not move or shake with the patient's head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then place a cautery tool dipped in egg white or slippery elm mucilage on the eye: then use a heated iron instrument shaped like this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 Let the cautery be hollow, like a reed pen, with one end closed, and if you wish for it to reach the other end, or if you wish for it to go upwards, then proceed thus.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this hollow instrument is better suited for your task.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then squeeze the abscess if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and cauterize it; and if it is not open, then open it, and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place a very hot cautery on it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand with the cautery near the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient; and place the cautery on the eyeball and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If you reach the beginning of your incision up to the mouth, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery once or twice, if needed; and leave it alone for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then apply an ointment with butter, and treat the wound with a drying ointment until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 But if forty days have passed and it does not heal, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine to it until the opening is revealed; and scrape it according to its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And there is another method of cauterizing an abscess that some have said first.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Direct your attention to the site of the abscess and find it; then place a fine probe into its opening, that is, a fine cannula whose shape is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 And pour into it a quantity of melted lead equal to a drachm, and hold your hand firmly with the reed, so that the patient does not move at all, lest the melted lead should reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 And it is necessary to place on the patient's eye a compress soaked in egg white or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it with remarkable healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula is cured by what we have said from cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 And if not, then it is necessary to make an opening in the nose and bring the fistula into the course of the nose, according to its own proper place.

Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, when you treat these fissures with what we have said for the division of diseases, and treatment is not beneficial, then use a small scalpel-shaped cautery, according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let its cavity be as thin as a knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place the heated cautery quickly on the fissures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.

When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum or palate or at the roots of the teeth: then pus is formed and it breaks open; afterwards it becomes chronic and pus runs out, and a fistula is formed. Then you treat the fistula itself, but if treatment does not benefit, then it is necessary to heat the cautery according to its size that fits in the fistula. 
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then introduce the burning one into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the burning iron reaches the depth and the end of it; do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then take care of him afterwards with what we have said about aftercare until he is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If the pus is cut off and it heals, then it will be good.

Then prepare a cautery of fire, the form of which will be described later, so that you place a cannula on the tooth: and quickly introduce the burning cautery into it; and hold your hand for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has already reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And lift up your hand; then repeat the cautery several times according to what you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for one hour; and then spit it out.

Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When the toothache is due to cold, whether the cold is within it or a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help; then there are two ways of applying a cautery to it: either cautery with butter or cautery with fire. 》
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The cautery of it with butter is such that you take cow's butter and boil it in a little iron pan or in an earthenware pot. 》 》 》
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take cotton and wrap it around the end of the probe.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then immerse it in boiled butter; and place it quickly on the aching tooth, and hold it there until it cools; then repeat this several times, until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth; then place a heated iron on top of it, until the heat reaches the depths of the tooth cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 The cautery of this with fire is to direct towards a bronze tube or an iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 And let there be something thick in its body, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then take a heated cautery whose shape will come, and place it on that tooth; and hold your hand until the cautery cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Do this several times, for the pain will be removed either on that same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 And it is necessary that after the impression of that cautery, the patient should fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 And this is the shape of the cautery.

When the head is dislocated because of humidity and does not return to its place at the hour of its own returning from its dislocation until it becomes habitual for it, then it is dislocated by a slight movement that happens as we have already testified about it; then you should return the dislocation first. 》
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the patient is placed on his back or on the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then raise the skin that is inside the Tetanus toward the upper parts with your left hand fingers: and if the joint is dislocated inward.

When cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, until they separate it from its proper balance, and catarrhs increase towards it, and persistent treatment methods do not help: then the sick person must be turned onto their back, and stretch out their legs and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.

When pain occurs in the liver from cold and moisture, or from excessive flatulence, until it deviates from its natural balance by an excessive discharge, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not help him: then the sick person must be turned onto his neck, and mark with a cautery three cauteries like this figure, and this size below the hypochondria, where the human elbow reaches; and let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body: and do not press your hand much with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the amount that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, half its amount not added: and let the patient stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If, however, he is not standing, then let him lie down with legs extended and arms raised.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the form of cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And it is possible for you to perform this cautery with a lancet-shaped cautery when you have skill and wisdom in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.

When an abscess occurs and you want to know whether it is in the liver or its membrane, then if it is in the liver itself, pain and heaviness come upon the patient without sharpness. But if it is in the liver's membrane, there is severe sharp pain along with the pain. And you will see that his doctors have been unable to cure him.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore, let the patient lie on his back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then mark the site of the abscess with a caustic; then heat the cautery that resembles a ray. 》
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And cauterize with it once, until the whole skin is burned and it reaches the spleen, until all the pus comes out; then treat him according to the treatment for abscesses, until he is cured.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And this type of cautery should not be used except by someone whose study in the art of medicine has been long, and through whose hands these diseases frequently pass with experience; then he may dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 And to dismiss it, I have a better way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 ¶ On the Method of Cauterizing in Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said that a hot iron with the roots of birthwort is used for cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is that you take from the dried and long roots of birthwort one root that is longer than the others, and let its thickness be like a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil, and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize with one cautery where the collarbone meets the clavicle, and with two small cauteries a little oblique towards the side under the chin.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two cauteries also between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly oblique towards the back; and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three cauteries from behind: one between the two shoulder blades, and two cauteries on both sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades. 》
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it is not necessary to press with your hand while cauterizing; rather, let there be a distinct smell of the skin burning.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And some of the ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery like a needle made from iron, and they heat it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and pus comes out; as we have said concerning the liver abscess.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this perforation with a cautery, there is fear that either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in that place which cannot be cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 ¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Spleen Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you are treating spleen disease with what we have said in the division of diseases, and your treatment is not effective, then there are three ways to cauterize it, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One is that you should make three cauteries or four lines along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the liver's cauteries, whose image precedes this.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let there be between each cautery a thickness equal to a finger or slightly more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 And let the manner of cautery be the same as we said for the liver's cautery.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the patient be on their back with their head raised.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 And another manner of cautery is that you burn with a cautery having two holes, as we said in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and lift the skin which is directly above the spleen, where the patient's left elbow reaches; and let your lifting be such that you lift the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then introduce two very hot holes until with them you penetrate the skin from the other side; then withdraw the cautery. Thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three holes.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then care for the cauteries after you have removed it, so that it may emit pus for many days; for this is more beneficial than any of the previous treatments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 ¶ On the manner of cauterizing in hydrops.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 A cautery is not made in hydrops except on the proper parts of the abdomen.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you treat a hydroptic patient with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not benefit, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the shoulders, and one directly over the chest, and another directly over the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then let the cautery remain open so that it may emit pus over a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not remove the patient from treatment after the cautery, for it is necessary that two aims be achieved: and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 However, the form of the cautery with which one cauterizes the stomach should be claviform; as was said before about its form. And the form of that with which one cauterizes the back should be olive-shaped, as was said before about its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 § On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When there is swelling in a hydrocephalus patient and the water turns yellow, it is necessary to cauterize on top of the foot, specifically in the interdigital space between the auricular and annular regions. Lift your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then lift your hand and do not press it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 For the yellow water will drain, and let the cautery be in this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be with the end of a lancet's tip; and let the cautery be according to the length of the leg, one below the knee and the other lower than that, about midway along the leg. And make two cauteries on each thigh. And leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may drain from it; then treat it with the rest as we have said. ‌
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 § On the method of cauterizing for abdominal pain.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV ‌
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the abdominal pain is due to cold and moisture, which weaken the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with remedial methods but does not heal; and you see that the patient tolerates a generous cautery well, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, as was said previously about the method of stomach cautery using a circular cautery. And make four subtle cauteries around the navel, using a subtle claviform cautery; and one large cautery on the alca above the anus, or two cauteries. ‌ ‌
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 And if you see excessive humidity and the patient endures it, then cauterize him with a cautery above the pubic region, and with a cautery in each thigh; and perhaps you should add two small cauteries on the abdomen near the navel.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 For healing is effective, whose benefit does not fail.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 ¶ About the way of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupt humidity, and are treated as we said in division, and the treatment is not beneficial: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower back of the spine under a slight triangular incision, and with a cautery below the navel about two finger widths.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you think that his stomach is chilled and his food is not digested, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him on the abdomen with a large cautery, as previously described; and with a cautery on his liver, and another on his spleen, together with a clavicle cautery. And leave the cautery open for some time; then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 ¶ About the way of cauterizing athlete's foot after their removal.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you cut off athlete's foot, then heat a cautery that resembles a ray of light.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then introduce it while burning into the cut athlete's foot; and continue your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows; do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If therefore there are many athlete's feet, then cauterize each one with a cautery as we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with the ointment that suits them until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on the scar, it is more effective as a remedy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 On how to cauterize an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the patient does not respond to incision and the operation we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he will be cured with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 So when someone gets an anal fistula and it becomes chronic, pus runs from it and corrupt humors.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 It is therefore more worthy to probe it with a fine probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then ascertain its depth with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then heat a cautery that is similar to a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then introduce yourself with the heated cautery into the fistula and as far as the probe reached. ︎
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeat the cautery on it until all those corrupt bodies are burnt up, once, or twice, or three times, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And beware of burning a nerve if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula extends to the bladder or the intestine, then beware of all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 But if the place is sealed and materials are cut off from it, and it remains this way for a long time, then know that it has healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And if materials are not cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating, or there is a corrupt opening at its depth, or something like that of which the reminder will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 On how to cauterize kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX. ︎
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When there is pain in the kidneys from cold or gross flatulence and the patient's strength is diminished because of it, then you should cauterize him on the loin above the kidney with a fine cautery, as we have mentioned before.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we will cauterize it a second time on that very same spot.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Why do three lines appear?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore, they will be more helpful in the end.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 On the Method of Cauterizing the Bladder
Caput XL.	 Chapter Forty
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, to the point where the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it at the lower part of the abdomen above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, and cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the abdomen and another from the left. The length of this cautery should be according to the size of the thumbnail. Cauterize it also with a lower back cautery, or two if you need it, and it should be as previously mentioned, a hot cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 On the Method of Cauterizing the Uterus
Caput XLI.	 Chapter Forty-One
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When cold and moisture occur in the uterus, preventing impregnation, causing its menses to be corrupt, delaying their onset, and pain occurring at their time of arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize it with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and also with a lower back cautery or two: and let the cautery be hot.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 On the Method of Cauterizing the Shoulder for Dislocation
Caput XLII.	 Chapter Forty-Two ›
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When mucous humors are discharged to the shoulder joint, causing it to leave its place, and a sign of this is that one leg appears longer than the other when compared, and the location of the dislocation is found empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore, the patient should be cauterized on that very joint with a similar circular cautery after marking it with caustic around the joint as it turns, so that the joint falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let there be a cautery of the form that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not present, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive-oil cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 Concerning the manner of cauterizing for sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in the sciatic nerve and its cause is coldness and moisture, and the patient is treated with what was said about division (of humors), but it does not help, then you must free the patient from thick humors with stinking pills or artificial pills and similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize him/her.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the manner of cauterizing is according to two methods: either a cautery with drying medicines or a cautery with fire. ︎
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 A cautery with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One of which is that you should cauterize above the sciatic nerve itself with three triangular cauteries, in this manner.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make them with a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And let the space between each cautery be as thick as a finger; and let the cautery be an olive-oil one.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle above the head of the sciatic nerve itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization for dislocation of the sciatic nerve, let there be one, so that the circle contains the entire sciatic nerve. ︎ ︎
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And burn through the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is the manner of cauterizing for sciatica when the pain is attached to the sciatic nerve itself and does not extend as far as the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 If, however, it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, over the place where the sick person indicates there is pain, and with your cautery four fingers above the pubic bone briefly; let the cautery be knife-like.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 But if the sick person indicates that the pain extends to near the toes, then cauterize him there where he indicates with a needle-pointed cautery, three or four times, or more, as needed.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 And if he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize him there with one knife-like cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And beware in all your cauterizations that you do not end with the cautery to the point where you burn a nerve or a large artery and thus bring about a harmful evil or contraction upon the sick person.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 And I myself have seen one and another of those who cauterized above the pubic bone and ended in cauterizing to the point where the leg swelled until a tumor reached the foot, and the whole foot was pierced and completely corrupted; then an abdominal rupture occurred, and death followed.  />
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If the pain is in two places at once, cauterize both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And some wise men have said regarding the cauterization of the ankle, whose cautery is this manner.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a similar needle from iron, whose diameter is half the palm's width; and let its tip be according to the thickness of an almond, or a little less; and inside that needle let there be another smaller needle.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And let the space that is between every needle be according to the size of the thumb's knuckle; and let the needles be open from both sides; and let their height be like a knuckle, or two knuckles; and make for them a handle from iron fittingly attached to the needles.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it should be heated over fire until it glows and emits sparks; then place it on a box of sea urchins in the patient's sickbed, on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Cauterize him with three round cauteries at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Afterward, apply plasters with butter, and let the wound remain open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with ointment until he is cured.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Al-Zahrawi said: We have used this type of cautery, O my son, only rarely because of the terrifying appearance of it, and we find few who would wait upon him.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 Yet it is one of the good cauteries for those who can endure it, and whoever finds its place will find benefit from it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 The cautery is made with adhering medicines, as you make two boxes with perforated hinges into which descends the bolt of its door made of iron or steel, the length of the wall, and at their height are two knobs or something similar.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let the space between them be as thick as a finger, and let them be open at both ends, and let them contain each other according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place it on the box of sea urchins, with the patient lying on his healthy side.  />
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand firmly upon the box of sea urchins.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour between the two circles hot water that has been heated briefly by fire, and let it be held for an hour of time; and the patient must endure its biting and burning, because he will find its bite like fire until the biting ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe away all the hot water from the sea urchins with fresh water; then leave it for three days.  />  />
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And put butter on it, until the blackness of the burn is removed; and leave it for some days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 For it is the last help.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 But if the pain extends to the hip or thigh, make for it a plaster containing water, as you have made for the ankle evenly.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is the way of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take alkali and non-extinguished lime, one part of each; grind both together, and put them into a new pot whose bottom is perforated with one small hole, according to the quantity that admits the very radius itself; and place under the pot another glass pot, and pour over the alkali and lime sweet water that submerges both by one finger width. After which you press it well with your hand: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then collect all that water and pour it over another lime; and distill until it clarifies.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 For then it will be very strong acidity, which is used in many medical procedures and in the cauterization of other members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Because it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medicines with which the ankle is also cauterized are casia and honey of the almond tree, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galen indeed reported the cure of some ancient man, by which he was cured of pain in the ankle and sciatic vein; and he greatly praised its effectiveness. 》
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that he did not need any other cure, and that he was cured in one application, until he reported that perhaps he entered the bath carried by men, and came out of it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is thus: take from the green seitarag; and if the green one is not found, take the fresh dry one; grind very finely with some fat, and place on the wound where there is pain, whether on the leg or in the hip; bind it and leave for three hours, or as long as the patient feels a lessening of the burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then put him in a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When his body becomes wet, place him on the stool.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For the pain goes away and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides said that goat dung, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, benefits it; and the cautery is made in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep spot which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and it is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry goat dung and burn it in the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out.
Deinde itera illud.	 Then repeat that process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Do not stop doing this until the sensation reaches the middle of the wound and the pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this type of cautery is called a cow's cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 ¶ On the Cautery for Back Pain
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Sometimes pain occurs in the back due to various causes such as a fall, a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, from an influx of cold and moist matter; and indeed cautery is not indicated except for this type alone, which comes from an influx of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 It is necessary therefore after the evacuation of the patient with foul pills and similar ones, that they be made on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the almeida itself, after you mark with encaustic in each line five or more cauteries, as many as the patient's tolerance allows by its virtue; and let the cauterization be done with a cautery needle.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a median nail-shaped cautery in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 About the method of cauterizing in a small hump.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This disease often happens to very young children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 And the sign of its beginning in children is that a stricture occurs during breathing while raising and moving, and it is found in the last vertebrae of the back and their joints, which has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 When you see this and wish to treat it, then cauterize with a cautery that is round in shape like this. ︎
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And let the cautery cover all parts of the vertebrae equally. If you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two or three lines, and let the points be close together. ︎
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for the place until it heals as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And beware of administering a cautery to a hump caused by a nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 About the method of cauterizing in gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When joint pains are caused by cold humors which are dispersed to any member of the body, then when they occur in the feet, according to the custom of physicians, it is called gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 When, therefore, podagra of cold cause is being treated with methods of healing, and the pains are not removed, then cautery will remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it should be cauterized after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries; and let the cautery be olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	 Whose form is this.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you need to prick on the sole of the foot, then do it with the cautery point.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it on every knee with three or four cauteries from all sides, with the same cautery Clavus.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If, however, you need more of this cautery, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not immerse your hand with the cautery; rather, let it be about as thick as the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 But if the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we said about the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If the pains are only in the hands, then prick around the joints, as if two lines were rolled up.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 But if any pain remains in the fingers, then prick them, one prick on each joint and on the web of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If, however, after days the pains ascend to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides. xspace
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not weaken the patient by a good diet or reception of medicines. xspace ︎
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 For if there is a good regimen and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God by this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 ¶ On the manner of cauterizing in hernias.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter 47.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When hernia occurs in the groin and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and this is a recent occurrence; then you should advise the patient to stop eating on that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And let him use purgatives so that his feces may pass from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then have him sit between your hands on his back: and tell him to hold his breath until it comes out or the intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then bring him back with your fingers, and mark it with a cauterizing iron above the anus, with a mark whose end is like half of a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then heat the cauterizing iron, which has this shape, until it brings forth white matter and casts off tiny particles.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then return the intestine or the hernia to its cavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then let the assistant place his hand on the spot so that the intestine does not come out: and you have already opened between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion under him, and another servant is over his thighs, and another over his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the cauterizing iron on the very mark, with your hand holding the cauterizer straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold him until you reach his mouth with it: or do the same thing again if you did not reach his mouth the first time.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And be careful to watch the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it and cause death or great harm to the patient through it.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cauterizer, your operation is of no use.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 And it is necessary for the cauterizer for infants to be thin according to their size. }}{
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with other ointments until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 And it is necessary to place his food during the time of his treatment so that it may soften his belly, so that the intestine does not come out at the effort and expulsion. ]{}
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then, when he wishes to rise after forty days, administer a well-made bandage and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And let him be kept from work, and from filling himself with food and drink, and from loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 For when he follows this regimen, he is healed completely.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I will discuss the treatment of hernias with incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 But when a hernia occurs in the rest of the belly and is recent, and you wish that it should not increase, then cauterize his hernia with a round cautery according to its size: and let what is burnt be a third of it from then on.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then treat him as we have said, and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And now some of the ancients have said that a hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this manner.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is marked with the cautery and a line is placed which is equal to its width on the upper side of the hernia, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with a claw-shaped cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 ¶ On the manner of cauterizing for pains due to a fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 48
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When pain occurs in certain members from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and medical treatment with drugs does not help it, then it is necessary to cauterize with a point cautery.  />
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And let the cautery be that of every member according to its size and weakness, and its debility, and its strength, and the place of the twist, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If he is then cured by the first cautery, that is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then repeat over that cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because the habit of these pains is to pass from one member to another which is near it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore, you must follow them with a cautery, until the sick person heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 Concerning the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Sometimes lepers are helped by a cautery to a great degree.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And especially the kind of leprosy which arises from the corruption of phlegm and black bile; when you want to cauterize it, consider its strength.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If therefore the leprosy is in its beginning stage and you have treated it with what was said in the division, and it neither descends nor stands still; and you fear that the corruption will spread to the whole complexion of the patient; then cauterize him five times on the head: one in the middle of the head, known as the navel; a second below this towards the forehead at the end of the hairline; two above each corner [of the forehead]; and one behind on the occipital bone. 》
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And the last time, place your hand with the cautery briefly on it until it leaves a small mark in the shape of an imprint, and let the scales be separated from it; so that the expiration of thick vapors may be relieved from it; and also cauterize the spleen with a cautery, as was said before.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient and clearly visible; then you should cauterize with these cauteries which we mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on each cheek, and two cauteries on each shoulder, and six on the shoulders of the back, and a large one on the thighs near the buttocks, and one on the anus itself; and two on the flanks; that is, one on each whole flank, and two on each knee, one on each whole knee, and two on each shoulder, and two on each elbow, and two on each nipple of his chest; and cauterize him over every joint from the joints of his fingers and toes, and cauterize over each heel of his feet, and the palms of his hands. 》
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 And beware of the nerves that are above the last part of the heel, lest you burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the tip of the pubis, and another on the tip of the stomach, and another on the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 And know that the more you apply the cautery, it is a greater benefit and more effective.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery as the healthy person does; for this reason, because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 And the cauteries should be according to size and smallness of the limbs and joints; as it was explained earlier in the types of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the cauteries with flour of barley mixed with honey, and continue the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing in a coma.
Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a limb is in a coma and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, but does not heal, then cauterize the comatose limb with cauteries, according to the size or smallness of the limb.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 And let your cautery penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 And sometimes it is cauterized for a certain coma that happens to the hand and foot, at the spinal column of the back near the exit of the nerves that move that limb; and the coma will be removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 Indeed, no one should attempt this unless he is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing for paralysis.
Caput LI.	 Chapter LII.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When ancient paralysis occurs and nothing helps from the practices of medicine; then cauterize it a little with a deep cautery according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with herb flour, and lentils with rose oil, and hart's-tongue fern leaves, and the blood of a dove, and the blood of a swallow: from each let there be one part. All these are to be mixed together and smeared on cloth, and they should adhere to the place until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 On the method of cauterizing for cancer.
Caput LII.	 Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When the cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a round cautery around its edge, as if rolling it along.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 However, the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the last point in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 But this does not seem right to me, because I fear that it might ulcerate; and indeed I have seen this happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 And it is better to cauterize around its edge with a circle, as we said; or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 On the method of cauterizing for abscesses.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has an abscess and it is delayed in ripening either because of an excess causing it or because the patient is weak and of little blood, or because of the time and you wish to hasten the ripening of the abscess, then cauterize around its edge with many small points.  ¶ De modo cauterizandi in Carbonculo.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then leave it alone.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For it will hasten on its own with the ripening.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery whose form is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 And place it in the middle of the abscess, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows the patient, so that the course of the pus may be relieved.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for him until he is healed.  ¶ De modo cauterizandi in Unguis cariosis.

Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 "A malignant ulcer is nothing but corruption walking within a member, and it eats away at the very same member: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 "If you see a malignant ulcer in a place that can withstand cautery and fire, then use much burning with both small and large red-hot irons, according to what is suitable for that place where the ulcer is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 "Then cauterize it from all sides until you have completely rooted out all the corruption, so that nothing of it remains whatsoever.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 "Then leave it for three days and place powdered sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized spots, until all the scabs and any corruption are completely removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 "Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 "If, after three days, you see that healthy flesh has grown where there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 "And if not, then repeat the cautery on the remaining parts of the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 "And let the malignant ulcer be treated sometimes with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 "For it arises in the place of the cautery." xspace
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 "However, cautery with fire is a faster remedy: and I have already said that its cauterization with sharp medicine was divided; receive it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 "On the method of cauterizing fingernails and warts.
Caput LV.	 Chapter 55
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 "Frequently this ailment occurs in the lower parts of the feet; it is a thick, dense thing that hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 "And there are two methods of cautery for them: cautery with fire and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 "When using fire, make the cautery a concave, hollow one like the feather of a vulture, made from iron, according to the size that contains the entire nail on all sides; and let it have thin edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the cauterizing iron on the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail until the iron reaches the depth of the nail, and leave it alone for three days until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then apply a poultice of crushed wild mallows mixed with salt upon it, and leave the poultice on overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat the place with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 But if they do not convert and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then administer cautery with hot water to them. And it is as follows: take a pipe made of bronze, iron or the quill of a vulture; and place it on the nail or wart.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a little hot water into the pipe; hold your hand and turn it with some pressure for a short time, so that the edge of the pipe is imprinted on the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail; and let the patient wait over the burning sensation of the hot water for about an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then leave it alone, for the nail will be eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Do this one by one with each of them, until you have treated all those that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then treat them after they have been eradicated with that which generates flesh from ointments.  />
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing for tremors.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When trembling occurs to someone from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or something else, then you should cauterize them with four or five cauteries on each vertebra of the back, and between every vertebra a cautery, and one cautery on the chest, and one on the stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 The tremor calms with olive oil cautery, and the health of the cold sickness speeds up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 About the way to cauterize Albathir.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter 57
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 Sometimes foul Albathir are expelled from the body, that is, pustules which come from coarse corrupted matters.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, when they first appear, they should be cauterized over every head of the pustule with a subtle cautery and with myrtle wood, whose end has been set on fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of long aristrolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner: and they do not increase; and the excess causing them is broken up, and healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, it should be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 About the way to cauterize in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter 58
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 It often happens that there is a flow of blood from an artery cut in a wound, which occurs externally, or at the incision of an aposteme, or a limb cautery and similar things; and it is difficult to stop it.  />
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 Therefore, when this happens to someone, quickly bring your hand to the opening of the artery and place your index finger on it; and press hard until the blood is blocked under your finger and nothing comes out from there.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place a small olive oil cautery in the fire and many more, and blow on them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one [of the hot cauteries], whether small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on that vein after you quickly remove your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If it is expelled with the elevation of the finger from the orifice of the artery and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore do not stop doing it with one after the other until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, lest some other harm come upon the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially when the artery is large, except with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or by extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is extracted, its ends are drawn together and the blood is cut off.  \\( \text { } \) Aut cum ligatura, quando non est ligata.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or by tying with a strong thread for ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or let there be applied to it medicines of astringent nature, which have the property of cutting off blood, and let them be tied with a decent constriction using a bandage.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 But he who administers its cutting off with a ligature and constriction with a bandage or the application of burning substances and similar things does not benefit him at all, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 But if this happens to someone and there is no doctor present, nor any medicine: then let him begin by pressing with the index finger on the orifice of that vein, as we have said, and constraining it very strongly until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound and over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And let the finger not be removed, and always pour over it very cold water until the blood freezes, thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile, he should consider whether anything is needed from a cautery or from medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 § De incisione, perforatione, et phlebotomia in vulnereis, et similibus.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 Nunc dabimus capitulum de incisione uulneris in quo conueniens est ut incidatur, et ubi non convenit ut incidatur, et de perforatione uulneris, et de phlebotomia, et ubi et quando conueniet illa.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 Et in fine dixi quod omnis ars habet quaedam generalia, et aliquid speciale. ¶ Hoc est primum capitulum liber secundus de arte medica.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 Primum quod necesse est cognoscere est locus et natura vulneris, et sic scies ad quid est conueniens. Vulnus enim in loco est loci naturae et potestas. ¶ Est et aliud genus uulnerum quod non est secundum naturam, sed extra naturam.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 Et cum haec cognoscere potueritis, scietis ubi est necesse incidere et ubi non est opus.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 Et ideo est necesse ut sciatur ubi incideretur et ubi non oportet incidere, et sciatis qualiter incidendum sit, et quod non est incisio sine periculo, nec est perforatio sine metu. ¶ Est igitur incisio, et cura uulneris, et incisio super apostema, et apertio exiturae, et extractionem sagittae, et incisio super lapidem.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 Necesse est igitur ut omnis medicus sit prudens et habeat intelligentiam, et possit discernere inter ea quae conueniant et illa quae non conueniant, nec incidat in loco qui non debet incidi.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 Et ideo necesse est ut scias loca periculosa, et incisio quae est extra periculum, et curatio quae conuenit uulnerei, et ubi non conuenit.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And with sickness from fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And among them is one who gives his flute to you and enriches you with it, hoping for health, but his sickness is deadly.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore, it is not right that you agree with the one who comes to you from among them whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 And let your caution be stronger than your greed and avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume anything from it until after certain knowledge verifies the praiseworthy outcome that reaches you. 》
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And use for the care of all your sick patients the prognosis and indication of that which is suitable for their health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For in this lies your aid for the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and may he not take away your guidance and inspiration from you; for that is in his hand. 》 》
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And I myself have arranged this chapter by chapters according to what preceded in the cautery chapter from the neck down to the feet, so that your search for what you want from it and need is made easier.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 ¶ On treating water that collects on the heads of boys.
Caput I.	 Chapter I
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this illness often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And sometimes it happens also for an unknown cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And I myself have not seen this sickness in anyone other than boys, and every one whom I saw from them hastened to death; therefore it seemed good to me to describe the treatment for it. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And I myself saw a boy from them whose head was filled with water, and his head swelled daily until he could not sit up because of the size of his own head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 And this moisture either gathers between the skin and bone, or it gathers beneath the bone on the surface of the spongy tissue.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation on it, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the abscess is small, then you should make a single incision in the middle of the head, its width being one finger's breadth: and let the length of the incision be as two fingers, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of the trepan.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 Therefore, if the moisture has increased more and the abscess is larger, then place those two incisions according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the skull open on all sides; and when you press with your hand towards the inside, water is depressed, and it is not hidden from you: then you should make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after making the incision, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then bind the incisions with cloths and poultices.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then dress it on top with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then loosen the bandage, and care for the wound with compresses and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And do not stop binding the head equally.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 And feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the part is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 And another method of incising is that you should look where the swelling of the abscess and collection of water appears.  />
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Because sometimes it is more on the back of the head, or the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore, proceed with the incision where you see the abscess and filling of water: and divide it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And be careful not to cut an artery and cause a bleeding, and the patient dies from that bleeding along with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 On the incision of arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When someone has a catarrh of the eyes or chest, and it persists and medical treatment is not helpful, then the final treatment for that person is the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when you want to incise them, the patient should shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries become apparent. 》
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let the patient tie his neck with any of his cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then observe where the vein pulsates.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And the locations of both are the areas behind the ears that are depressed: and rarely are they hidden, except in certain people. 》 》
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark both with cautery: and cut each with a spatula that is sharp on both sides, the cut reaching to the mouth: and let this be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and cut it from above with the same cut.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 And let the length of the cut be as two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 For when the vein is cut, blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which jumps towards the inside with frequent leaps. 》 》 》
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 But if the artery is not apparent to touch, then measure from the ear the length of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with cautery, and continue until you reach the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And what should be released from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will release more or less than that.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 The whole amount according to what appears to you from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery. 》 》 》 》 》 》
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then observe at the wound. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 Then if there is anything remaining at the mouth from the cloth, cut it off so that a hot abscess does not form. Then bind the wound with linen cloths.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 On the removal of arteries which are in the temples.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When someone suffers from an old headache or severe migraine due to sharp humors and heat in the temples, or an old harsh cold, or similar conditions, and is treated with appropriate medical methods but does not improve, we have found in these illnesses that removing the arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have described, is beneficial.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 And the method of operating for their removal is that the patient should shave off the hairs on the temples and direct [his gaze] toward the visible artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 For it shows itself to you by its own pulse and is rarely hidden except in a few people or due to extreme cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it is hidden from you, then let the patient bind his head with any cloth of his; afterwards, rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or apply steam to the place with hot water until it appears clearly to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take the small scalpel that I have described before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then use it to cut away the skin easily until you reach the artery. ↑
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then insert a hook into it and draw it upward until you pull it out of the skin, allowing it to emerge from all the layers beneath it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 But if the artery is thin, then wrap it around the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut off a piece of it according to the length by which its ends are extended and contracted, so that there is no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not cut or severed, the blood does not rise completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then drain off six ounces of blood until three [ounces] remain. ↑ ︎ ︎
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a double, strong thread of silk or gut, so that putrefaction does not occur before the wound heals and blood loss does not happen.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut away the excess between the two ties.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this in that hour or another hour later.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery iron until the ends are cut off and it stands in place.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And this is better work unless the patient has a fever or is of hot constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because cautery is one of those things which help to dry up moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the removal of the artery, the place should be filled with old cooked linseed and neatly made bandages placed over it. 》 》
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after the dissolution, let it be scraped with dry medications that promote the growth of flesh and with ointments until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if, during the operation, there is bleeding from the artery, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery or to fill the place with wax, and keep your hand steady until the blood is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 But if you have none of these at hand, then place your finger on the spot until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And sprinkle the spot with very cold water until it calms down and is tied off as needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And because the removal of a vein is easier and simpler than that of an artery, it should be cauterized with this two-bladed cautery; let the sharpness of the two blades be like that of a needle.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 Nevertheless, they are much less sharp than two knives. 》 》 》
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Since they are sharp, like two knives, it hastens cold for both; and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Therefore, if there is some thickness to them, they retain the heat of fire and cut through the flesh quickly; for this reason, this operation is better than any other, easier, and more convenient.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 Let the space between the two knives be equal to the thickness of a finger. After marking two places with caustic, place both very hot irons there until they reach the surface and cut the vein in two places so that what is between its ends may be extended.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 For this caustic does not heal thoroughly.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the form of the caustic.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 ¶ On the treatment of persistent, sharp watering of the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When tears are persistent and their flow comes from the veins outside on top of the head, and no medicinal treatment with medicines helps, and you see the patient's face is already red, and they feel a sensation on their forehead like that of ants walking, and their eyes are weak, wet to the point that the hair around them is eroded away, and their eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears, then the ancients needed this operation for their treatment and called it "with the Sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And it is as if you command the patient to shave off the hair on their forehead.  />
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three incisions in the forehead, equally spaced along its length; and let the length of each incision be about two fingers wide. Let one incision be at the midpoint of the forehead, another slightly above the hairline on either side, and the third at the far edge. Be careful not to cut the arteries that are on both sides. Keep your hand away from the extension of the jawbones, and let the total length of all the incisions be about three finger widths. And have a piece of sponge ready, or many dry cloths with which you can soak up the blood.  />
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert a narrow spoon with two sharp tips, whose following is the shape.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the incision that is on the side of the temple, to the second incision: and scrape off all the skin that is between the two incisions with a scalpel, which is above the mouth.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove that narrow spoon and insert another instrument into the first incision, which is called a sharp blade, gently from one side and not sharply from the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place its sharp edge towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its gentle edge towards the mouth; and push it until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except for what continues in the incision until it appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then do the same in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And after an equal amount of blood has been allowed to run out, squeeze out the places from the clots of congealed blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place a bandage made from old linen cloth on every fissure, and put on them small woolen pads soaked in wine or oil, or vinegar.  />
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And be sure that no hot abscess forms.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 And on the third day, loosen the bandage and administer a large amount of decoction with warm water.  />
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with balm ointment and other remedies for wounds until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 ¶ On the treatment of sharp tears and colds to the eyes from inside the head.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When someone has sharp, acrid, persistent colds; and you see their eyes are wasted, small, and the look in them is already weakened; and their eyelids have ulcers, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, painful pain at the back of the head, followed by sneezing: then take from these events that those humors and colds do not come except from many veins.  />
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 And a better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 It is as though you were to instruct the patient to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make an incision in the middle of the forehead or slightly to one side across its width, and begin with the incision from the left temple towards the right: and let the incision go as far as the mouth: and keep your hand away from the temples which move during chewing; until the mouth is revealed: and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with an old rag or with linens from flax.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then bind it on top with bandages; and moisten the bandages with wine and oil, so that no hot abscess may form.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you remove it, and see that the hot abscess is already diminishing; then it is necessary for you to scrape the mouth until new flesh begins to grow there.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then care for him with the drying regimen that makes flesh grow, as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the newly growing flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 ¶ On caring for what falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a liquid, such as water and vinegar and things similar to them; or some sort of animal.  /> 12/5
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 Therefore, when a stone or something like a stone that does not grow or increase falls into the ear, expose the ear to sunlight; and if you see the stone, then drip some of the oil of violets or sesame oil into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer the extraction and make him sneeze with snuff, and plug the nostrils at the onset of sneezing, after you have placed shreds from cloth or wool around the ear, and stretch the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 For often it escapes with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not escape, then administer the extraction with gentle purgatives, that is, with subtle suppositories, whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 Therefore if it escapes with the suppository, that is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then administer the extraction with a subtle blind hook of few folds.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 Therefore if it does not escape through that [method], then make a tube from copper and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole very deeply; and plug what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no path for air except through the tube: then extract with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 For often it escapes with what we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If it does not escape this way, then take from henbane or from glue, that is, prepared birdlime, a small amount; and place it on the end of a rod after you have wrapped around it a clean cloth neatly arranged: then insert it into the ear hole with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 Therefore if it does not escape with all that we have described, then hasten to cut [it], before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 And the manner of the incision is, as for a bloodletting, first make an incision on the temporal artery; and draw out blood from him according to his strength.  />
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and find a small incision at the root of the ear in its fatty part in a depressed place itself; and let the incision be lunar-shaped until you reach the stone; then remove it with what is possible for you from instruments.  />  />
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then attend to the split from your time with speed, and care for it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 But if the falling object is one of those seeds which grow and swell, then extract it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 However, if it does not obey you to come out, then take a thin, subtle probe according to this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And perform with it the cutting of that type of seed which falls into the ear and does not do this when you think that the seed is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you divide it into many pieces; then remove them with tweezers or with a fine hook or with suction, as we have said, for its removal is made easier. 》
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 In the case of water which enters the ear, the sick person should use sneezing first of all; and now he has filled his ear with some old cooked grain: and it is lying on that ear which contains the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 Therefore if it comes out through it, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if it does not come out, then take many small stones according to the length of the finger, thin and soft, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the sick person put one into his ear canal; and let him stand on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone upon the stone which is in the ear. 》 》 》
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Therefore he should not cease doing this with stone after stone until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And now the water comes out so that you take one reed or rush and put one end into the ear; and light the other end with fire until most of it is burned up.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then repeat this with another reed, and do this many times until all the water comes out; and remove it with a tube as we have said above regarding the stone. 》 》 》 》 》 》
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 In the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is a small body, like a flea and similar to it, care for it as I said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it is of a large body, which can be perceived by the senses: then administer its extraction with tweezers and hooks, and its process is easier than all that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 But in the extraction of a worm born in the ear, when you care for it with what we said in division and in the discussion on drops, your treatment is not beneficial; then you must examine the ear in sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 Therefore, if something appears there from the worms, then extract it with tweezers or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 But if nothing appears there, then take a tube whose form is this: narrow at the bottom, wide at the top; and insert its fine tip into the ear according to the amount that the patient can tolerate; then suck with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 But if they do not obey you to come out, then fill around the tube with wax, as I said about the pebble.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 But if they do not come out with that which we said, then administer the drops that have been found effective by the ancients for the destruction of worms; and you will find this in the discussion on drops.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your pouring be such that you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you see, make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom, in which there should be a small hole, wide at the top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Therefore, let what is in the cavity of the tube be made neatly from brass.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take a stick, and wrap a fine thread around its tip with decent wrapping; then pour oil or juice, or whatever you want from these medicines into the tube; and let the tube be in the ear; then insert the stick with the thread on top, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure until the oil is pushed into the cavity of the ear, and the patient feels it inside; and what is poured into the ear should already be warmed a little with fire; and beware that what is distilled into it is not very cold; for medicines do not tolerate this.  />
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 "On the Care for an Ear Injury
Caput VII.	 Chapter Seven
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 Sometimes infants come out of their mothers' wombs unruptured.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it has also happened to some people that an ear injury occurs in the inner part of the ear due to a wound or fleshy growth there.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this injury sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which does not affect vision; and sometimes it happens near the outer part of the ear canal, and then it affects vision.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear and which sight does not perceive is difficult to heal in most situations.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in the case where vision is affected, it is necessary to place the ear of the patient in the sunlight and look into it; then if you see an apparent injury, open it with a fine probe whose shape follows this one [drawing], its tip should have a small flat area at the end, part of which should be sharp: and the rest of the probe should be smooth on both sides so that it does not harm the ear. 》
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 Therefore, if the injury is due to flesh growing in the inner part of the ear, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it away with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If the injury is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth wire and heat it briefly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you feel the injury with it, which the patient perceives with difficulty in hearing, try to open it gently: and be careful not to wound the nerves of the ear. 》
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place in the ear a piece of cloth according to the width of the ear canal, which you have rolled in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take a piece of cloth and dip it in rose water, and sprinkle ground cinnamon on it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see the ear already infected with pus, then you must extract the hair, and place it together with another hair that you will wrap in a rag made with rose oil, until the hot infection subsides; then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 But if there is a flow of blood, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place the ear upon it; and use the remaining treatment that cuts off the flow of blood as described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 On the care for sty in the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter 8
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 These styles that occur in the eyelids of the eye are sometimes wet and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore it is necessary to hold them with tweezers or with a hook, and cut them off from their roots with a knife.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place powdered alum on the places.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 But if there is a flow of blood from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens-shaped cautery. ●
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 For often they return when something remains from their roots. ● ●
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned up and do not return. ● ●
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 ¶ On the care for chalazions in the eyelids of the eye. ● ● ●
Caput IX.	 Chapter 9 ● ● ●
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 It often happens in the eyelids that something similar to a chalazion appears in its strength and hardness, and on account of this it is called a hailstone; and it is an accumulation of thick humidity in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 The operation on them is that you should then see if it is a hailstone extending from the eyelid, which moves in every direction and its substance is soft. ● ● ● ●
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 "Therefore, find over it a crack of equal width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 "Then excoriate it from all sides with ease until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 "Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 "However, if you cannot cut it off unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a slight incision, then that could harm the patient in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 "But if the crack is large: then stitch it up and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 "And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 "For an ointment restores and heals it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 "And if the gravel is sloping toward the inner surface of the ear, then turn back the eyelid and suspend the gravel with a hook; besides needing an incision, press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 "If the eyelid is stretched by the incision, that will not harm in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 "Then wash the eye with salt water after removing the gravel, and care for the area with what heals until the patient is well.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 "§ On the treatment of trachoma of the eyelids.
Caput X.	 Chapter 10
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 "Trachoma is the grease that forms in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and it most often occurs in children. It weighs down their eyes, and they frequently have morning colds, unable to look at the sun because tears rush to them, which is why you see them always lying on their faces and sleeping on them, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are wet from inflammation. The protruding Axirnath is visible in the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the way of performing it is that the patient places their head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a linen cloth and prepare in it a bandage, and make from that bandage a circle according to the size that contains Axirnath from every side.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then place it over [the wound], and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that Axirnath collects in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in the middle of that moisture with a thin blade making incisions across [the circle], and let the incision not be deeper than that which is made in venesection.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 Or you should find the entire skin, until you reach Axirnath, for in many arrangements proceeds Axirnath from the incision according to the shape of a white fatty piece.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 Therefore, take it out with the cloth that you have placed between your fingers on the outside; and you turn your hand to the right and to the left, until it is dispersed; and beware not to add [anything] in the incision, so that you do not reach with the blade to the eye and injure it. ➤
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 However, if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, then add a little [more] easily into the incision until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then take it out as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on [the wound], and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And there are people who grind salt and place it in the depth of the incision, so that it may liquefy what remains from that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for [the wound], until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 However, if a hot abscess occurs there, then care for it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 ¶ On the types of ataxia of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye is softened, whereby it causes a disturbance as if it should not.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs grow in the eyelids besides their natural course and become long, they harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as constant tearing, swelling of the eyelids, and opacities, until it leads to the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And ataxia of the eye is treated in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Either by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or with a caustic medicine, as previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Or ataxia is treated by incision and suture.  />Aut per punctum.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 Or with cannulas, as I will describe.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 You should place the patient's head in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then, turn back the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If it turns back, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if it does not: insert a needle with thread into the lower part of the eyelid and pass the needle with the thread through the upper part, placing it near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow. Pull the thread to the top along with the eyelid and turn it back with a rod.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then, find the space inside the eyelid beneath the added hairs using a blunt instrument from the greater lacrimal gland to the lesser one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then, pull out the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid; then mark on the eyelid with an enkauster in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, the figure should be made according to the size and thickness of the eyelid, as it varies among individuals.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 For there are those who need to have cut from the eyelid a large quantity, according to the amount that swells up in the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then when you find the space between the two lines that you marked, begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller one, and let there be a single slit near the natural hairs, like the thickness of a hair.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then introduce a hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then scrape it off entirely.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then join the two lips with a stitch using a fine woolen thread and needle; clean away the blood and let what remains of the threads adhere to the two eyebrows with some unguents, if you wish to do so; otherwise, it does not matter.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then leave the stitch and threads for three or four days; after that, take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish, leave the wound without a stitch and care for it with something that dries and constricts it.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and its joining; but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of treatment was taught by the ancients to Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, there is concern for the patient with this method, and it is from good practice, and there is no fear about it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And there is another method in Ataxmir as well, and it is to mark on the eyelid a figure like that of a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then raise the eyelid with three separate or joined hooks according to this following figure; then cut away what is excessive with small scissors according to this figure, with an equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 But if you cannot hold the hook and it is not equal, then take a needle with thread on it and insert it in the middle of the figure; and introduce another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second one near the smaller tear duct; and join the threads between your fingers with equality. 》
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then raise your hand with an equal elevation: and raise the skin over which the scar is marked, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches: and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 But if an abscess occurs at your incision or fracture: cauterize that abscess with a hot iron and similar things from the soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs turn inward.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, you should use what we said about the incision: but the stitching of both is more artistic.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 § On treating Ataxia with Cannabis.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 And it is as if you turn the eyelid and cut the crack that is inside, as I have said.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then skillfully make two reeds or two thin pieces of wood whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of the spatula; and you have already cut at the ends of both from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then bring both together with skill over that which protrudes from the eyelid of the eye, and tie the two reeds strongly on both sides, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 For the skin, having been tightly bound, will die, blacken, and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.  />
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 When it has solidified, raise the eyelid; and the hairs will not irritate.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the form of the two reeds which you make according to this figure and quantity in length and width.  />  />
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 § On raising irritating hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 Operation in that is, that you should take a fine needle and introduce into it a fine thread of silk gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then you will bind the ends together with two very fine knots; and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then prepare another fine thread under it briefly, and if you wish, bind its ends together.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then let the patient place his head on your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the operation can be seen; because this is a fine or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then introduce the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you pull it out above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then draw up the hair over the thread; and insert that hair into the thread, if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then draw your hand with it until the hair comes out with the thread from the eyelid together with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 But if the thread is drawn and the hair does not come out with it, draw the thread downward with the other thread that you prepared in it until the thread comes out from the upper hole, and you see it with the eye; then draw the thread and the hair together, and pull both out, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair sticks to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs and pull it up with it; or leave it until it lengthens after some time, and then pull it up yourself.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 On the care of the entropion which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter XIII
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this entropion occurs in the eye, it is called leporine.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this is either congenital or acquired.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Therefore, it occurs accidentally from the healing of a wound, or an incision, or cauterization, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 And the method of operation is that you should locate that healing and separate its lips, and place between them a bandage of linen, and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 And you should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict, for if you do this, the condition returns worse than before. Rather, use in it things that soften, such as fenugreek; and an infusion of water in which mallow has been boiled, flax seed, and diacolon ointment mixed with some oil. And wrap a bandage with it, and treat it with this.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 The treasure of your treatment is to strive by every means that it does not heal according to its first shape.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 And this operation that we have mentioned is nothing other than a correction of the axlatrati, so that the shape of the place does not completely return.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 ¶ Concerning the treatment of axlatrati that occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkle or contraction upward toward the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This axlatrati that occurs below is what is truly called axlatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 And it is either congenital or acquired.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the acquired type occurs from a wound, or a fissure, or cauterization, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 And the method of operation is to take a needle with two threads attached, and dip it in ink, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal gland to the right lacrimal gland until the thread comes out at both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then stretch the flesh upward with a needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take a reed and place it in the slit, and turn the eyelid with it. And find two slits on the inner side of the eyelid, and let their ends be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle; so that when they come together, it forms this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp lower edge reaches the part that follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then join the separated parts; or sew it with a wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with what we have said about softening medicines and ointments, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 And if entropion occurs from the slit, or sewing, or cautery, then you must make a flat incision under the eyelashes of the eyelid, even as it has been described before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between the two lips with ointment, as we have said.  />
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 And the end of the discourse on the treatment of entropion, whether it is above or below, is that this operation be carried out according to the preparation of the form of entropion.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 For indeed, it has many different forms; and the skillful practitioner prepares his ingenuity with whatever method is possible for him, so that he may bring back the shape to its natural form or very close to it, and even the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in most dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 ¶ On the adherence of the eyelid of the eye with the conjunctiva or cornea.  />
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid fuses with the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 You should therefore insert the point of a needle under the eyelid and lift it up, or stretch it with a hook. Then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be as sharp as the incising spatulas, but rather blunt for a short time, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed without injuring the eye with its sharpness. And your incision should be as if you are scraping off that adhesion with ease, until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the adhesion heals completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then pour salt water into the eye and wash it with that water, or distill it into the eye using a sieve made from zinc dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen cloth, and place a woolen cloth soaked in egg white over the eye. After three days, use the sieve and bandages until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 § On the incision of the nail and the excess flesh of the tear ducts.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter 16
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the nail exists in two forms.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Either it is nerve-like and resembles a fine, hard sieve, or
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 It is not nerve-like but resembles a frozen, white moisture. When you touch it with an iron tool or try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks off and the hook does not penetrate into it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And both types do not appear except from the larger tear duct, which gradually grows until it covers the sight and prevents light and movement of the eye. 》
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method for operating on it is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open his eyes and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then collect the fingernail with a small hook, and extend it towards the top.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take a needle and insert a horsehair, or cow hair, or goat hair into it; and let the thread be strong, and slightly double the end of the needle, and fix it in the middle of the nail; and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it towards the top; and strip off the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were pulling it out with the hair until its very end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the remainder in the root of the tear duct with a fine scalpel or with small scissors; and leave the natural tear flesh intact, so that persistent tearing does not occur from the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone; or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then it should be scraped gently with a scalpel of this form.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the transparent membrane and cause a break in it, and the pupil be pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, put some crushed salt, or made from sieved sandalwood, into the eye, and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for him with what is needed until he heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the nail is not fleshy and you cannot insert a needle into it nor can a hook be fixed in it, then this type of nail is often cured with medicines, and heals as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye and take a fine, gentle, weakly sharp scalpel of this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And scrape the nail from above with subtlety.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it becomes thin and brittle, and a wrinkle imprints on it, then distill into the eye from your hour with sieve made from ziniar, or with red sieve, or with ground salt: and fill the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat this same procedure until it is all removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye: then leave it alone and care for the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the procedure with wrinkle until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 If the prominent flesh of the tear duct is causing great harm to the eye, it should be hung with a hook and cut from that part: and do not complete the incision so that the course of tears will not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then distill into the tear duct with a red sieve or one made from ziniar until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 ¶ On the incision of Alguardenic and flesh formed in the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter Seventeen
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 Sometimes in certain people's eyes, red flesh forms and covers or almost covers the pupil, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards; and it resembles a rosebush.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the treatment for this is that the patient should put his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open the eyes of the patient and collect all that flesh with appropriate hooks; and hold it with one forceps or tweezers. ‍
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then cut the flesh first until all of it is completed with a scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 And be careful not to harm the eye during the procedure; and your incision should be with what you cut it with, or with a small spatula, as we have said in the incision of the fingernail: or with small forceps, with which asebel is collected, according to its form after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 And so when your incision is complete and all the white of the eye has been removed, then fill the eye with ground salt or sprinkle red powder and similar things from corrosive medicines onto it; and place a piece of eggshell with its membrane outside the eye to protect it from a hot sty.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If some of the white of the eye remains and hot blood prevails in you and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye alone and treat it with that which calms the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the procedure on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And do likewise with the flesh that happens to be in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 However, it is necessary that those who are treating any weak eye from natural or accidental causes with the knife should not intervene in any of these operations until you see that this member is able to bear that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 ¶ About collecting pus from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter Eighteen
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 Pus is red veins that are spread over the eye and prevent vision from functioning properly; they weaken the eye with the passage of time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 Therefore, first of all, you must consider whether the eye in which there is pus is strong and has no other disease apart from pus; then collect the pus from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And tell the patient to place his head on your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend those veins with one or two hooks according to your skill; and the hook should be thin, made of silver, like this, or there may be two hooks joined together on one body, like this.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect those veins with fine scissors carefully and wipe away the blood hour by hour until you see those veins removed from the eye and they are released; and beware of injuring the eye with the tips of the tweezers.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And let your operation be in the midday before the sun, and be steadfast in your operation very much: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have irrigated, then apply drops to the eye, either green or red, so that with its sharpness it may gnaw away what remains of the stye.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 But if you are not able to remove all of it in that time, then apply a plaster to the eye with what will soothe the pain of the eye; and leave it for several days, until its pain is quieted: and be sure that it has been freed from the hot stye. Then repeat on it according to the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the form of the scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 About bringing back a deviated septum to the nose.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter Nineteen
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 Doctors call a deviated septum a fistula, which you should treat with a cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as its previous account stated.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 And if it does not heal, then there is no cure for it, except to incise over the stye at its base and draw out all of the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the opening is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 Therefore, when the opening has been exposed and you see corruption or blackness within it, then shave it with an instrument whose form is this:
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 And its name is "cap of roughness.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Let it be made of Indian steel, and let its head be round like a needle, which has been marked by the marking of a file or the fine marking of a burnisher; and place it on the corrupted place of bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then turn it between your fingers and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption has been shaved away; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with drying, styptic medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place is consolidated and flesh grows there, and the course of pus is cut off: and it remains for forty days, and does not renew, and does not suppurate, and no accident occurs in it: then you should know that it has already healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nasal aperture according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And it is that you expose the bone with an iron instrument or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take a trepan according to this form, let its tip be triangular of iron: and its handle be a tapered pyramid up to the tip, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it on the bone itself; and let it be near the tear duct; and keep your hand away from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn your hand with the trepan, until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it; through this that he finds air coming out of it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 When flesh grows and the place hardens: then the matter that was discharged to the outside returns to the nose; therefore it is easier on the patient.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 ¶ On the Reduction of a Swelling of the Eye
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye swells completely and there is no harm or diminution of sight: then it is necessary that you release the patient; then bleed him; afterwards place cupping glasses on his neck without scarifying, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then apply to the eye an ointment made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then bind the eye above with many thin bandages over the plaster.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the method of poultices is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth from them should be folded into four; make many of them. Then place them one on top of another according to the amount the eye needs. Then bind them strongly with a hard cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And use fumigations with suction without scarifying.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the fumigation and leave the eye bound day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 But if the swelling again becomes soft, then it must be bound tightly; then remove the binding after one day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, if you see the eye has returned to its normal state, it is good; and if not, then repeat the application of the poultice, and the binding, and the fumigations, until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 § On the incision of the eye's tunica.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When a break occurs in the eye's tunica, then it protrudes and extends outside the eyelids like a grain of the eye, and it disfigures the person's appearance because of this, and he wishes to cut it off. Then the operation is as I describe: that you insert a needle into the root of the eye from the lower part to the upper part. ‌
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another needle with double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle in its place.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut the place of the double thread and tie with it the part of the eye around the needle; and bind it tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then remove the needle, and place a wool cloth soaked in egg white on the eye; and leave it until the thread falls with the eye.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the eye with what strengthens it until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes the eye is bound from all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds a large protrusion.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then it should be pierced with a fine probe until it reaches the depth of the eye, and let the moisture of the sclera flow out, and let the eye fall out, and immediately enter; then bind it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 About the treatment of alcomnatis (a kind of eye disease or disorder).
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This sickness called alcomnatis is nothing but a purulent discharge that accumulates in the eye, similar to water descending from above, and it is not [the eye itself].
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the method for treating this condition is that you should make the sick person sit on a prepared or upright seat.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take his head with your hands from both sides and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts of the eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then let it be fixed in place and not move downward, and the light will become clear; and the sick person will see things as he used to see them. And if it does not go downward, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 But if the descent of the pus does not occur as we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a fine probe and pierce with it slightly above the thin skin where the conjunctiva meets the corneal layer in the corner of the eye, until the pus comes out. ️
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When the pus comes out, then drip warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 About the treatment of water that has descended into the eye or cataract. ️
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have already mentioned the types of water in the division and what applies to piercing according to the explanatory discourse and exposition; then take that same [thing] according to healthiness.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then you should make the sick person sit between your hands, facing the light, near the sun. And bind his healthy eye and tighten it strongly. Then with your right hand, hold closed the eyelid of his left eye (in which is the water), or with your left hand, if the eye in which is the water is the right one.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take with your right hand almagdah if the eye is left: or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the end of the almagdah near the crown in the thickness of the radius where the white of the eye appears, next to the smaller tear duct; then push the almagdah with force, and turn your hand with it until it penetrates the sclera of the eye, and you will feel that the almagdah has reached a hollow place.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And the measure of the journey of the almagdah should be deep, as much as the space is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 For you will see these things in the pupil of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place the almagdah up to the point where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it down with one force after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If therefore water descends immediately, then the patient sees that thing on which he opens his vision immediately, and the almagdah in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then wait a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If water descends again, then remove it a second time, except that the almagdah comes out. xspace
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it is fixed and does not rise again, then remove the almagdah gently; and turn your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve some clear salt from the mine in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place outside the eye a piece of wool or cotton soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind it with the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 We, however, and those who are of our time, place on it ground cumin seed mixed with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the almagdah does not obey you for entry into the eye because of its hardness, since it is made from people whose eyes are very hard, then you should take a spatula called Alberid, which looks like this.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Therefore bind it with that very suture, and do not thrust your hand into the opening; there is no need to make a path to the almagda place, but rather make the way subtly.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then insert the almagda, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient a well-made bed in which he may sleep on his back in a darkened house; and let him be kept from all movements and coughing; and give him such food as is gentle to his nature; and let him not turn his head either to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the bandage remain in place according to its position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then remove it in that darkened house, and test his sight; and make him look at things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it is not proper to do this at the time of dressing or immediately after the incision; rather one should delay it; because water rises quickly through a strong gaze.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 But if a hot abscess occurs, then one should remove the bandage before the seventh day; and correct it with that which allays the abscess until it is allayed; then release his sight, and place on his face an oculus to regulate his vision under it for several days, while he remains in the darkened house.  />
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then let him go out of the house gradually, and turn about in his affairs.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that a student is not excused from looking at it several times; then he may dare to perform the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And indeed there has come to us a certain man from those who are of Aleppo, who said that in Aleppo a magda was pierced through which water is sucked up.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read of it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 And these are the forms of medicines from honey, so that one who does not know them may stand over them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 They should be made properly from air, and their ends should be triangular with the same subtlety and sharp.
Formae magda.	 The shapes of honey.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 ¶ On the care for flesh grown in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter Fourteen.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Sometimes fleshy growths of various kinds appear in the nose, among which is something resembling a many-legged scorpion; and from this comes cancerous flesh, stony flesh, dark in color; and from this comes flesh that is soft and not dark in color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 In that which is from these fleshes and is soft, not fraudulent or cancerous, you should make the sick person sit between your hands facing away from you; then open his nose and insert a hook into those fleshy growths; afterwards draw them out to the outside and cut off what you have grasped from them with a thin, sharp spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been completely removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 But if any of it remains which cannot be cut off, then scrape that away with a single delicate instrument easily until nothing of it remains.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 But if there is too much blood or a hot swelling occurs, then apply what is necessary to it; or if it is from malignant swellings, hasten to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the fleshy growths are removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then after cutting pour vinegar, water, or wine into the nose.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 But if the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that he is now cured.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within there is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nose, which the instrument did not reach when cutting.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then you must introduce a linen thread with some thickness and tie many knots in it; put a finger's width or less between each knot. The patient should insert the end of the thread into the nose with a bone splinter or whatever he can, after making it similar to azar. He should pull on his nasal septum until it reaches the cavity and comes out over his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed, many times schoolchildren do something similar to this Atom boy; it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place the two ends of the thread; one end that comes out over the nose and the other that remains inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then, with the aid of a saw, cut the flesh along with the knots on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do this until you know that the flesh is already with the knots on the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then remove the thread and insert into the nose, after washing off the blood, a linen cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for three days or more until all the remaining ointment from the flesh is completely dissolved.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then at the end of the treatment, insert a lead tube into the nose for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If however, dry treatment is needed, use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 To make a headpiece for distilling oil and other medications into the nose, make it from silver or copper; let it be similar to a small lamp, open like a snail shell, and its channel likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish, make it as a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the snail-shaped instrument for making a headpiece should be full and open; it should have a handle at its end, with which you hold it when heating oil or anything else you wish from juices and flexible substances in it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 ¶ On the care of a nasal polyp.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Often a polyp appears at the tip of the nose and grows larger with time until it becomes unsightly.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And because of this, it is necessary that you cut it out at the beginning of its appearance and remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place on the site either a hot iron or a burning medication which will take its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If its cutting is delayed until it grows large, then consider whether it is stony, hard, dark in color, and relatively insensitive: then do not touch it with iron because it is a malignant tumor.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 For often I have seen someone cut into this type of polyp, and a great evil befell the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the polyp is soft to touch, not dark in color, and you see that it is possible to cut into all of it, then evacuate the patient and cut it without fear or hesitation: and treat the site with something that dries and constricts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 ¶ On suturing the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when there is a disruption of continuity in one of these cartilages, surgery is of little benefit except in certain people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when something like this happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood: then join the lips of the wound with suture: then treat it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if the lips of the disruption have already separated and each part has healed: then it is necessary that you scrape off all the part from its apparent skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then join the two lips with suture and tighten them, and sprinkle on it powdered dragon's blood and ground frankincense: and place over the powders a piece of adhesive plaster and another consolidating one: and leave it tied for two days or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then dissolve it, and exchange the medicine; and let it go until the threads are cut by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with an ointment, until he is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of suturing is to join the solution of continuity either with needles, as we have described in the suturing of the belly; or join the solution with a thread, as I have taught you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 ¶ On the extraction of lip nodes.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many people have hard nodes on their lips like grains of barley; some are smaller and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, you should turn back the lip and pierce through every node of it, and hang it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after cutting with crushed rush-root, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place should be scraped with it, until the wounds are healed. 》
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 ¶ On the incision of flesh on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Often there appears over the gums a growth of extra flesh which the ancients call "abulus.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore you should hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, allowing the pus or blood to flow out.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place crushed rush-root or other hemostatic powders over the site.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does return, then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return after cautery.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 ¶ On filing teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29. 》 》 》
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 Sometimes on the surfaces of teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums, rough scabs form, which are ugly; sometimes they turn black, yellow, or green, until that corruption reaches the gum, making the teeth foul-smelling through it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 It is therefore necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands, and rest their head on your chest. Grind away the enamel and the tooth in which there appear to you cortices and a substance similar to sand: until nothing remains of them. And do likewise with blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other stains until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 Therefore, if the cause of what is in them is removed at the beginning of treatment, that is good; and if not, then repeat the treatment on them on another day, a second time, and a third time, until finally your effort achieves what you desire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that the tooth requires rasps of various shapes and many forms according to how it is prepared for your operation; because the rasp by which the tooth is scraped from below is different from the rasp by which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And let these shapes of rasps be prepared with you, as you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 § On the Extraction of Toothache
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary to cure the tooth from its pain with all skill and delay in extracting it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For it is not right to remove it when it is extracted, since it is a sublime substance; unless there is no choice but to extract it, then the patient must be forced to extract it so that the painful tooth may be strengthened and confirmed with you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 For often the pain deceives the patient and they think it is in the tooth, and so they extract it; then the pain does not go away until the tooth itself is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 For we have already seen this from the practice of bloodletting physicians.  />
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 When the painful tooth itself is confirmed with you, then it is necessary to scarify around the tooth with a spatula that has some virtue, until the gum is dissolved from all sides; then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until you shake it out.  />  •
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and hold the patient's head between your knees, which you have already secured well so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under the tooth from all sides easily, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If the tooth is perforated or decayed, then you should fill that hole with a cloth and tie it tightly with a thin wire so that it does not break when you constrict it with forceps on top of it.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And you should carefully perform the scraping around the entire gum very well.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And be careful not to break it and leave a piece behind, which would cause the patient more pain than before.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And beware of doing what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and recklessness in removing it, besides giving that which we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For they often cause great illnesses to happen to people, whose consequences are more difficult to heal, and all or some of the roots remain, or they extract it with some bones of the jaw, as we have witnessed many times.  />
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then rinse with wine, vinegar, and salt after its removal.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If bleeding occurs from the site (for it often happens), then grind some myrobalan and fill the site with it; if not, cauterize the site if myrobalan does not help you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The form of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long arms, a short handle, and be thick so that they do not bend when pressed on the tooth; let them be like you see with thick handles, until when you tighten them, they do not give way or bend: with short arms, and let them be made decently from Indian iron, or well-made steel, with straight arms; and in their extremities there should be teeth, some of which fit into others and hold with a decent and strong constriction.  />  />
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes the ends are like the beak of a bird called stork, and they are very tight.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 On extracting teeth, and removing broken jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When something remains in the extraction of a tooth that is broken, then you should place a cloth soaked with butter over the place for one day or two days until the area softens. Then insert into it algasti or forceps, whose ends resemble the beak of a bird called stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 And this is the shape of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 Their ends should be made like a file inside, or like a small scissor.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 Therefore, if it does not obey you in exiting with these forceps, then you should hollow out the root and expose all the flesh, and insert a small crowbar, which looks like this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 Let it be short at the end, somewhat thick; and let it not be wet, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 Therefore, if the root exits through it, it is good; and if not, you must help with these other instruments whose shapes are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The shape of the first is a triangular end, in which there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The shape is of a thin triangular end. 》
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 It is also helped by this instrument which has two branches, and its shape is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools which have been mentioned in the section on teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 It is also helped by this instrument which resembles a large hook of this shape, with a twisted triangular end, in which there is some thickness so that it does not break; and let it not be wet. 》 》
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many instruments of the teeth; and similarly the rest of the instruments are not counted, and a skilled craftsman, who is clever in his art, finds for himself an instrument according to what the operation and the diseases themselves indicate.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because there are diseases for which the ancients did not mention an instrument, due to their diverse types.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If, however, a bone is broken from the jaw or other bones of the mouth, or if it becomes putrid, then investigate above it in its place with what suits it from the instruments and tongs that I mentioned for extracting roots, and help with this, whose shape is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Let there be something thick in it little by little, so that it may be tied or held with the bone and not flee and go away, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with suitable medicines for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it off from its putrefaction and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 Concerning the Sawing of Prominent Teeth over Others.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When teeth prominently project not according to their natural course, an ugly appearance is made by that: and especially when it happens to women and girls, namely sellers of themselves.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, you must consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if a tooth is born after another tooth and is not located properly, or its sawing or planing is possible, then extract it: and if it is connected to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose shape is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It is similar to a small beak and is made of Indian iron, very sharp at its tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And let your cut with which you cut it be over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 But if it is exposed to its planing: then plane it with a plane from India, whose shape is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 Let the whole [plane] be from India, and its handle very small, like a plane with which needles are made: with which the tooth is planed little by little over many days easily, so that the tooth is not moved and falls; then anoint it in the end, scrape it with certain scrapers.  ?> Et quod scias hoc est instrumentum quod dicitur bisturi.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If it is a tooth that is broken and injures the tongue, then it is necessary to smooth it also, until the roughness of that break is removed and made even: and it flattens out and does not injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 ¶ On the Extraction of Teeth with Gold Threads.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When it happens that the anterior teeth are concussed and shaken by a blow or accident and the patient cannot hold together what he eats so that it does not fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines and the cure did not work, then the plan is to tie them with a gold thread because silver turns green and putrefies after a few days, but gold never changes. ¶ When you bind the teeth, make sure to bind from the root of the tooth up to the neck of the tooth, and tie it carefully in the middle so that there is no slack nor is it too tight; take care not to cause any harm to the gum or the neighboring tooth.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let the thread be of moderate fineness and thickness according to the size that fits between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 And the form of extraction is this: take a thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then weave with the two ends of the thread between the moved tooth or teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weaving to the other healthy tooth on the opposite side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then repeat the weaving until you reach the part where you began; and hold your hand with fineness and wisdom so that it is not entirely removed; and let your constriction by which you bind the thread be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not escape. ¶ And when you have completed this binding, you will find that the tooth or teeth are bound up and secured.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut the overhanging ends of the thread with scissors; and join both together and turn them with a needle; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moved tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it remain tied thus. ¶ And you will find that this binding is a strong aid for the tooth or teeth, so that the patient can chew his food well without difficulty.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it is loosened or cut, tie them with another thread, and they will remain thus throughout the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of a healthy tooth and an unhealthy tooth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And sometimes it happens that a tooth or two return to their places after the incident, and are retained as we have said, and they remain there; and this is done only by an experienced and skilled craftsman.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes a piece from the bones of cows is prepared; and it is made into the shape of a tooth and placed in its place, and the tooth is strengthened and tied as we said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 ¶ About the cutting of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, which prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, which a person is born with, or accidental, from an old wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 And the operation is to open the mouth of the patient while holding their head in your lap, and raise their tongue; then cut through that nerve-like ligament along its width until the tongue is released from its restriction.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 But if there is something hard and knotted in it, and it comes from an old wound, then insert a hook into it and seek out the width of it until you cut through the ligament and release the knotting.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And be careful not to make a cut too deep into the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and cause bleeding.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then wash the site of the incision with rose water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place a linen cloth under the tongue, which the patient should hold every night, so that it does not heal again. 》
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 If blood flow occurs, then place ground zea on the spot.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If blood overcomes you, then cauterize the spot with a brunette iron; and then treat it with the other treatment until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 About the removal of a cyst that forms under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 It sometimes happens that under the tongue a cyst forms, resembling a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it may swell so much that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the treatment of this is to open the sick person's mouth before the sun, and observe the cyst.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If you see it to be dark-colored or black and hard, with the sick person feeling no sensation in it, then do not touch it because it is cancerous.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if it is inclined towards whiteness and has moisture, then insert a hook into it and cut it with a thin scalpel, and free it from every part. ︎
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 If blood overwhelms you during your operation, then place ground zea on it until the bleeding stops; then return to your operation until you remove it with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and treat it with the other appropriate treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 About the treatment of a cyst in both tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 It sometimes happens between the throat and gullet, that is, between the tonsils, which resemble almonds; they occur externally and are called two amygdalae. If you treat them with what we said in the previous chapter and they do not heal, then observe.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If it is a hard cyst, dark-colored, with little sensation, then do not touch it with iron. ︎ ︎ ︎
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is red in color and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood; rather leave it alone until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Then either you will pierce it, or it will burst on its own.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is white in color, round, and its root is fine: then it is necessary to cut into it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the operation on it is such that before the operation you should consider if its hot inflammation has quieted with a complete quieting or diminishes by some lessening: then have the sick person sit before the sun and let his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let the assistant receive between his hands, and press the tongue downwards with an instrument of this shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be made of silver or bronze, which is as fine as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 When therefore you press with it the tongue, and the inflammation is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it out as much as you can towards the outside, except that you pull along with it some of the tunic. ()}
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut into it with an instrument of this shape which follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It resembles scissors; but the ends of it should be curved so that the opening of each is opposite to the sharp point of the other; therefore see to it that it is made of Indian steel or another kind which can hold an edge well.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 If however this instrument is not available, then cut into it with a spatula of this shape.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 Let it be sharp on one side, and not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after you have cut into one tonsil, cut into the other in accordance with this same shape of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then after the incision let the sick person gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If he has a flow of blood, let him gargle with water in which the bark of pomegranates or myrtle leaves have been boiled, and similar stiptics, until the flow of blood is stopped; then care for him until he heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Therefore, cut those equally as I said for the incision of the two tonsils.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 And I myself have already treated a woman for an abscess that had arisen in her throat, which was pulling towards darkness and scarcity of senses, nearly closing her throat; and the woman was breathing from a narrow opening, and it had already prevented her from eating and drinking water; and she had almost reached death if she had remained one day or two.  ()
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 And the abscess had risen so much that it sent out two branches until they came out through the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 I therefore hastened quickly and inserted a hook into one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it, and a large piece came out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then I cut it off where I held it from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I did to him what had come out of the other nostril.  ()
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue; and then I inserted a hook into that abscess; then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood came out from it; the woman's throat was therefore healed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then she took food.  ()  ()
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 I did not therefore cease to cut from that abscess many times over a long period of time; and the abscess would follow in the place where I had cut, until it became too extended with her.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 I therefore cauterized the abscess in the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 He remained from the addition; then I walked away, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 § On the incision of a uvular swelling.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When catarrh descends to the throat and swells and is long, it is then called a perpendicular; and if it is thicker and rounder below, it is then called a grape.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is treated with what we have said about division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot swelling has subsided from it and is thin, then you should cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And if what is gathered from it is round and does not have length, and is red or dark in color, and has no sensation, then you should avoid cutting into it. 
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For there is danger for the patient in this.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore, when you see it according to the whiteness and its length as I have said, you should make the patient sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument whose previous description has gone before; then insert a hook into the grape and pull it downward; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.      
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And you should not cut from it, except that which is added above the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you cut more from it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after the incision, use what we have narrated in the incision of the two tonsils; and care for it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 But if the patient is afraid of the incision, then you should use skill in cauterizing it without fear or dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 And the method of cautery in it is not, except with boiling water; and it is as if you place the patient's head on your lap.     
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take from the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and make an unquenched mortar with it, not thick nor too thin, and fill this hollow of the instrument, whose shape is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let its end which holds the medicine be hollowed out like the bowl of a spoon.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 And place the instrument with the medicine on the same ulcer: and let the patient lie on his side, so that the saliva runs out of his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends into his throat and harms him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you apply it to the ulcer for half an hour until you see that it has turned black and that the chewing of the medicine has settled down.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you wish to use cotton, and wrap it around the end of a spoon, and pour medicine onto the cotton, and insert the spoon with the cotton into the ulcer until the cotton adheres to the ulcer.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do this many times until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then leave it alone; for indeed it dries out and falls off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization, clean around the ulcer with cotton soaked in butter, and cleanse it with that which is around it from the medicine: and rinse it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And let it be scraped externally with plasters, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 This method of treatment is therefore healthier than cutting, and more distant from fear.  />
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes the ulcer is also cured with that which is more subtle than cautery and incision; it is cured with fumigation in this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Gather calamentum, hyssop, oregano, rue, saffron, chamomile, and southernwood, along with similar herbs. Combine them all or some of them in a pot and cover with vinegar. Bring to a boil. The pot should be well-lined with clay, and in the middle there should be an opening over which you place a concave instrument in this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 It should be made of silver or bronze. Insert the end with the hole into the mouth of the patient until the steam rises through the tube and darkens the throat sufficiently.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeat this process many times until dryness occurs.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 Be careful not to perform this treatment at the onset of inflammation.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 For it often increases the swelling, and you should not do this except when the heat of the inflammation begins to subside.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 But if this instrument is not available to you, then take a reed and place at its end the shell of an egg so that the patient's mouth does not get burned. Because the shell of the egg prevents the steam from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment with health benefits.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 ¶ On the Extraction of Thorns and Bones from the Throat
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter 38
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often, a bone or a fishbone sticks in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore, you must extract whatever appears, after pressing the tongue with an instrument under bright light and it becomes clear to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And if something does not appear and is hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 For perhaps the thing will come out through the vomit.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or let the patient swallow a piece of nap, or a lettuce root, or a mouthful of dry bread, or take a piece of soft sea sponge and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When it reaches the place of the spine or bone and is extracted, then it exits.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If therefore it does not exit with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead in this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 Let it be slightly thicker than a finger and have a curve at its end which he can easily insert into his throat; then let him raise his head upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let him be careful not to touch his epiglottis, lest he should cough and force out bone or spine; or the physician may insert his hand instead.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 It is truly better that the patient insert it himself because of his knowledge of the place where the object is attached; and let him push downwards or pull up his hand with the instrument until everything comes out according to its size.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 ¶ On the Extraction of Leeches
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When a leech is treated with the remedy mentioned in the division of treatments with medicines and it does not help, then examine the patient's throat in broad daylight or in sunlight after pressing his tongue with the instrument I have described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If your sight falls upon a leech, extract it with a small hook or with fine tweezers carefully.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with them, then take a hollow cannula and insert it into the patient's throat until it reaches close to the throat; then introduce into the cavity of the cannula a red-hot iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this many times; and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day. ‌
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him take a sieve full of cold water and open his mouth into it; and let him rinse his mouth with it, but not swallow any of it; and move the water in one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 The leech indeed immediately falls when it senses water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 But if it does not come out with what we have described, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs or with a bean using the instrument that I have mentioned for the fumigation of the throat.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this many times, for she will fall.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 And the method of operation in fumigation is to take a pot with live coals and fire, and let the pot be covered with a lid, in whose middle there is a hole; and let the end of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then pour the fumigation and let the patient put his mouth on the end of the tube, and let him close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 For the leech will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 But if she does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 And let the patient endure thirst and eat salted food and garlic, and let him not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Therefore it is necessary that she will come out with this regime.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And this is the shape of the instrument with which the leech is drawn out from the throat when it falls on its own.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It resembles forceps, as you see, except that this curvature is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 And its end resembles the beak of a bird called a stork, on which there is the roughness of a file; when it grasps something, it does not release it at all. 》
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 ¶ On the opening and cutting of abscesses, and their general care.
Caput XL.	 Chapter 40
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 There are many kinds of abscesses and various methods for opening them, according to the memory that comes to us in this book, namely one kind and one in particular; and there are two ways of perforating and cutting them. 》 》 》
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One is of the species of a tumor within itself, and because it includes moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 And the second method is due to the places where it happens from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Since a tumor occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the anus; and a tumor occurring in a fleshy place is different from one occurring in joints; and each has its own judgment based on its position.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And among tumors there are those which should not be pierced except after the pus in them has matured and completed; and there are some which should be pierced while they are fresh and do not ripen according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 Like tumors which are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Since a tumor when it occurs near a joint and its duration is prolonged until what surrounds it putrefies perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are destroyed; therefore it is a closer cause of the contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or the tumor is in a main limb; since if you delay its piercing until it matures, it will harm either that [limb], or through that main limb [the whole body].
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus; therefore pierce it while it is immature, and you should not pierce a fresh tumor which has not completed its digestion, except that which is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus and become a fistula, or end in a place that does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 You should know the time for piercing a tumor which has matured according to its completion; and it is at the cessation of pain, the subsiding of fever, and the diminution of redness, pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the tumor, and other signs.  />
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And you should make the same perforation in the lower part of the tumor and its more prominent area; and let the piercing be along the length of the body if the tumors are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of arms, strings, nerves, arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.  />   
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those [conditions] that reflect, go with a perforation along that membrane.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 When the abscess is in fleshy areas, it is better to leave its perforation until its digestion is consolidated, as we have said at the conclusion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus is prolonged from it, and there is much dirt and foulness, and perhaps its lips harden and its depth [becomes] affected.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body by necessity, or according to what that member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And you should administer a small perforation for small abscesses and a large perforation for large abscesses, or many sections according to the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And there are abscesses in which it is necessary to concave the skin and cut when it has become like a cloth, and it has reached its end, that is, it is already dead, as happens with many ulcers and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And among them are those which are cut with a three-cornered incision.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And among them is one which is cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And among them are those in which a round section and a crescent-shaped section, and similar ones from the sections, are administered.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 However, that which does not have a head, such as are the mild and superficial abscesses, you should perforate it with a superficial or flat perforation only.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 And when the abscess is thick and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, do not hasten to extract all the pus at that hour; rather, extract a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then prepare the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then extract something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do this many times according to the condition, until it comes out: especially if the patient is weak or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit person; for the vital spirit of the living creature is often released from the body with the discharge of pus, and perhaps the sick person will die, and you won't notice.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your perforation, by which you pierce these abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound: and observe.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If therefore the abscess is small or the incision is flat, then apply a compress of flax or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if the abscess is large and the incisions are many, it is then necessary to insert a compress into each incision until they meet each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if in the abscess you have cut off a piece of skin or hollowed it out: then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton, or as when making felt, or shaving flax down without moisture: and bind it tightly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then remove it, and care for it with what is necessary from the ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 But if bleeding occurs during your procedure, then apply cold water and vinegar, after the cloth has been soaked in them: and place it on the site of the bleeding many times. />
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer a regimen and treatment and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and from the division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 But if it is during the winter season and the site of the abscess has many nerves, then you should pour hot powders with wine and oil onto it: and place them on the sites.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is in the summer and the places are fleshy; then you must place little poultices soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we have said, then you must release the abscess and clean it, and administer to its healing what is suitable for it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 Therefore, this is necessary from the knowledge of treating abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to half of the distinction, I have already spoken about every abscess and how there is a way to treat it individually by chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 ¶ On the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 Little abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the species of nodules, which are enclosed by sheaths, like those of hens' eggs.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And their species are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Some of them are fatty; and some contain a moisture like clay; and some contain a moisture similar to gruels or poultices; and others similar to these, and there are those which are hard as stone.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in the incision of all of them and their extraction there is no danger, as long as during their incision a blood vessel does not cause resistance.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the operation of their incision is to examine them with an instrument, the shape of which will come after this, called Introducer, until you know what they contain.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a section along its length with a superficial section; in this manner. 》
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin with the section from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture is evacuated, then remove the skin that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it. 》 》
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Often it returns if something of it remains.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For it [the kist] indeed eats away what remains from the kist.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then anoint the cotton a second and third time with the Egyptian [unguent], and if you need to, continue doing so until you are confident that nothing remains of the kist; then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the aposteme contains a fatty tumor, then cut it according to this shape, with an incision forming a cross: and throw the hooks between the lips of the incision, and strip it from all sides: and strive to extract the membrane that encloses it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 But if a contrary reaction is caused by the blood vessel, then do what I will tell you later.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And likewise do this for an aposteme if it is stony, with the same incision and treatment as we have said.  />
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 And the incision on a stony aposteme is easier because it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 And sometimes there are certain of these apostemes which are on the head in some men, and with which there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 That is to say, for I cut into an aposteme on the head of an old woman and found the aposteme like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if someone hit it with something thrown at it, it wounded [the person].  />  />
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 In other apostemes that occur on the head, however, apart from these apostemes that occur on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, let the incision of all of them be a surface incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Or make their perforations always from below them, so that the flow of pus will be relieved towards the lower [part].  />  />
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then care for them with what is suitable for their treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Of cutting the tonsils in the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These abscesses often occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins; and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And concerning those which occur in the neck, there is one and many; and they generate each other; and every tonsil among them is within its own proper tunic, just as it is with nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 And there are many types of these tonsils.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For some of them are stony; and among them there are those which contain moisture; and among them there are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 Therefore, when you see one of them which has a good disposition and texture, whose color is close to that of the skin, and it moves in all directions, and it is not connected with the nerves of the neck, or with the vein, or with the artery, and it is not deep; you should cut it out by means of a superficial incision from top to bottom along line b-g, and scrape it off from every side; and spread apart the two lips of the skin with a hook or with many hooks if you need them, as we have said about the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it is important to be careful not to cut a vein or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 And let the knife not be very sharp, so that it does not make your hand hesitate with the cutting, or disturb the patient, and you do not cut what is not necessary. ›
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 But if you cut a vein or artery, and it hinders you from performing the operation, then place in the wound ground zegi, or certain powders which stop bleeding, and bind up the wound, and leave it alone until the inflammation subsides and the wound becomes soft; or begin and it wants to putrefy. › ›
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 "For blood is severed by the skin, return therefore to your work until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then inquire with your index finger whether there remains anything from the other small strophulae; therefore cut them and clean them out.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 But if there is a large vein at the root of the strophula, then you ought not to cut that strophula from its root; rather, you should tie it off with strong doubled thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with old cotton which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then care for him.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the entire strophula is cut off, then you should approximate the two lips of the wound and sew it up immediately after you see that there is no remaining pus.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 But if you see that there is remaining pus because of the largeness of the strophula, then you should intend to cut off its root and pull it out; and apply the stitching which we have mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And for those strophulae which contain humors, make a superficial puncture in them so that you may see their stage of maturity; and make the puncture from below the body as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply lint with ointment and similar things after the puncture, so that it may eat away what remains of the corruption, until you see the wound has been cleansed; then care for him with regenerative flesh ointment until he is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 § On the incision of the epiglottis due to an abscess occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients said that this incision is made on the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and here is their explanation of it. ›
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 In those with a stricture, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided because it will not bring benefit; all the veins and lungs are weakened.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 In those with a hot abscess in the mouth, throat, or both tonsils, and there is no illness in the intestine, the epiglottis should be incised to avoid the destruction that occurs from choking.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we wish to do this, we should incise the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis with a small incision by width, in that which is between two circles by quantity, so that the incision is in the cartilage, not in the cartilage: and this place is suitable for incision because it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels from it are distant.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the surgeon is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then let him pierce the skin until it reaches the canal; he should avoid the blood vessel if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then let him cut the cartilage as we have said; it is indicated by the suppuration that comes out of the canal along with its breaking and the loss of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And leave the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 Therefore, when the time comes that choking is feared, gather together the two lips of the skin wound and suture it alone without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then apply treatments that cause flesh to grow until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Albucasis said this.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 The summary of this discussion that we have narrated is not applicable except when they see that one of these abscesses has already choked the patient's throat and the patient is close to death and wishes to be incised; they go to cut the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe over the wound for a certain breath and be saved from death. And for this reason, they commanded leaving the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice lasts three days or thereabouts; then they commanded suturing the wound and treating it until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And what I have seen with my own eyes is that a maidservant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, cutting through part of the lung's canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was called to treat her, and found her moaning like a dying person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 Therefore, I opened the wound and found that blood had come out from it only in small amounts.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 Therefore, I was confident that she had not cut a vein or an artery; and air was coming out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I hastened to sew up the wound and treat it until it was healed; nothing happened to the maidservant except for a hoarseness in her voice, and after some days she returned to better health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Therefore I say: that there is no fear in cutting the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 ¶ On cutting a hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter Forty-Four.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This tumor is called a hernia of the throat; it is a large tumor similar to the color of the body and is common among women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 And there are two types: either it is natural or it is acquired.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 Certainly, the natural one has no cleverness.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The acquired type, however, is of two kinds; one resembles fatty nodes.  ·
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the other type is similar to the tumor that results from a knotting of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And in this case, there is danger; one should not assume to cut it with a knife unless it is small. Test it and examine it with an intromitter.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 Therefore, if you find it to be like a fatty node and not connected to any veins, then cut it as one would cut a node; and remove it along with the sac containing it, if there is a sac; and if not, then explore its entirety.  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·  ·
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then treat the place with what is needed for healing until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 On the cutting of superficial tumors.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many kinds of tumors, and I have already described all their types in the division: and it is necessary that I now tell here the difference between a tumor and an abscess, since this causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 I say therefore that when it is an abscess, there is heat, fever, and severe pain until the ebullition of the superfluity is calmed and the putrefaction is completed; then indeed the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 But in a tumor, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain; and they contain kistis ifachin, which is their own bag, and it is according to the color of the body: and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like bathecha, either larger or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And there are two kinds of them: either fatty, or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 The colors of the moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you come to the healing of a tumor, you must examine it and investigate its contents first with an instrument called a probe, as its form will be shown in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 And the way to investigate all tumors and swellings is as follows: take this instrument and insert it into the moistest part of the tumor which you find; then turn your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then place your hand behind according to the size of the swelling.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then remove the probe and examine what exits in its wake.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If a running moisture emerges from it, whatever its color may be, then incise it with a superficial cut, as I said in the case of other swellings.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if the moisture does not exit the wound after insertion, then know that it is fatty. Cut above it with a cross-shaped incision as I have taught you: and hang it with hooks, and remove the skin from all sides easily: and keep kistin over it, if you can, to extract it whole with the knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 But if the bag bursts during the procedure and it is not possible to extract it whole (for this often happens), then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 For if some little or much remains, the knot will return in great quantity.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if you are overcome and something remains: then at the end of your procedure fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders; and close the wound, and place a warm compress on it, and care for it along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 Therefore if the knot is large, then either its two lips, and care for it with that which causes healing.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 But if the pulsating vein is against you or not pulsating: then hurry and fill the zegi place with ground powder, and leave it tightly bound for two days or three until the wound putrefies and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to cut that which remains from the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 ¶ About external instruments for cutting and perforating.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 Among them are the forms of intromittal instruments, and they are of three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one. ︎︎
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 They should be made of square-ended steel with neatly trimmed edges to hasten entry into the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these are the forms of the instruments for probing and puncturing, that is, the piercers; one of them is called beris, that is, the piercer; and there are three types of them.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 Of these there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They are used to investigate aposteme, issue, fistula, and buboes from the bone between them.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 Others are made round, smooth, and soft, like large needles with which to stitch seats, of citron wood, or copper, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 And the best of them are those made from citron wood.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And experience has also been gained from black lead [graphite], which is suitable to investigate fistulas that have recesses, so that it can glide with them gently into the recesses.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because from them there are long ones, and medium-length ones, and short ones, according to the width of the fistula and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The shape of hooks is diverse and of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because from them there are simple ones, that is, those which have one curvature; and they are of three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And among them are blind hooks; and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And among them are hooks having two curvatures, and they are of three kinds; and among them are hooks having three curvatures, and they are of three kinds; and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 And these are the forms of scalpels, with which nodes and aposteme are cut and scraped; and they are of three kinds, because from them there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.  \\
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 Their tips with which the cutting is done are sharp, the other tips are not sharp; and they are not placed thus except to be of help in scraping nodes when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the sick person may heal through them and find some relief for a while from the burning sensation that is found in scraping an aposteme.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are magdala, and they are among the three spices.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 It is made from copper and resembles a ray [of light], with which it makes alcohol: and at its broad end there are hidden small perforations: and through them it runs to the interior and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The shape of the hidden spatulas that are between the fingers at the perforation of the fistulae: and the sick person does not feel them; and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The forms of the ventuses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 They are made from copper or brass, round, slightly elongated, as you see: and they should be very thin.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 And you should have these large and small kinds of ventuses with you: so that you may quickly cut off the blood through them when necessary, and then when there is no medicine at hand.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 However, you should not use them to cut off blood in every part of the body, and you should only use them on fleshy parts: such as the thighs of the legs, and the hips, and the arms of the upper limbs, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes they are made into small other instruments similar to the peels of figs, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein, or an artery: and sometimes they are made round according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 ¶ Concerning the treatment of human breasts that resemble female breasts.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell at the end of sleep (that is, when they begin to sweat during sleep) until they resemble female breasts: and they remain unpleasantly inflamed.  /> ¶ De cura eorum.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 He who abhors that should cut above the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from the line b to the line g. Then remove all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Then fill the wound with healing ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then join the two lips of the wound together with a stitch and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the breast falls downwards and softens because of its size, as happens with women, then two crescent-shaped incisions should be made on both sides of it, each one meeting at the end with the other, so that the larger line encloses the smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Then remove the skin between the two lips and take away the fat, and administer what we said about the stitch and powders, which are necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 But if you cannot complete the incision that you should make because of the restlessness of the patient or due to bleeding, then you should fill the wound with a cloth soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it corrodes away the remaining fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him until he heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 ¶ On the perforation of an abscess that occurs under the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These abscesses that occur under the nipple are of the hard variety of tumors, which contain cysts, and among them are those which contain fluids.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Therefore, those which contain fluids should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from line b to line g. When everything in the abscess has been evacuated as pus, then fill it with an old cloth and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then the bandage is removed and it is treated with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the abscess is of the kind called "Strophuli" knots, then cut over it as we said for cutting over Strophuli equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 But if the wound spreads to the point of discharging pus, then apply a hot iron to it as we have said previously.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 On cutting an abscess that occurs because of an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery bursts and the skin above it heals, then often an abscess occurs from there; and similarly this happens with veins, so that an abscess and swelling occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are because of an artery or vein are: because when the abscess is from an artery, it is long, deep within the body; and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a crackling sound. ➤
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And that which is from a vein is round and visible on the body's surface.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And cutting over this abscess is a mistake, especially if it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very serious.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, its treatment with a knife should be avoided, and that which is also at the extremities or on the head should also be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Therefore, over what comes from them from an inflammation of the artery opening, find a cut in the skin lengthwise.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the cut with hooks, afterwards the artery; and free it from its coatings until it is laid bare.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then introduce a needle under it and make it penetrate to the other side; and tie off the artery with double thread at two places, as I taught you for extracting two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then prick the place that is between the two ligaments with a lancet, until all the blood comes out and the abscess is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a treatment that produces pus, until the ligaments fall off; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If the abscess is due to a cut vein, then you must hold with your hand what you can from the abscess along with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert a needle under the place that you held with your hand, and make it penetrate through; and let there be a double thread in it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then tie it together with the abscess using a good ligature, as I have told you for a grape ligature, from two sides with two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 But if you fear that the thread might be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole abscess near the incision of the needle; press down and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is inside comes out; then cut away the excess skin and leave what was tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place on it a little wool that you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a treatment made with bandages and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 ¶ About the abscess that occurs from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As an abscess can occur in arteries and veins, so too it can occur in nerves; this occurs in them from a blow or from excessive labor and the like. And it happens most frequently in the joints of the fingers or toes, and in every place where the joints move; and it is a severe abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 It resembles the color of the rest of the body and is usually painless. However, when it is strongly constricted, the patient feels a numbness similar to that caused by cold.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And there is no abscess formed deep within the body, but rather under the skin, and it can be moved in all directions, neither advancing forward nor backward.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 Therefore, if this condition is in the joints, it should not be cut open with a knife.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 For perhaps contraction may occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 But if it is on the head or forehead, incise the skin with a scalpel.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If, therefore, the abscess is small, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then hang it with a hook and peel it off; then remove it and close the wound with stitches; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 ¶ On incising an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	 Chapter LI
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 It happens to some people very often in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies that there form little swellings which are called fungal tumors because they resemble mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Whose root is thin and whose head is thick, and the lips of these tumors are turned inside out.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And there are small ones among them; and there are some that grow very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 And I myself have seen a man who had two of these tumors in his belly, and they were more like mushrooms than anything else; there was no difference between them - they were white, with small roots, and the lips of both turned inside out, and they oozed, and moisture always ran from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I then incised them and found that one weighed about eight ounces and the other six ounces. And the operation for incising them is as follows: if the patient is moist and the tumor is white, soft, with a thin root, then incise it with a broad scalpel and have cauteries ready in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 Often indeed much blood is expelled at its section; therefore hasten if you are overcome by blood, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 But if you see the patient is fearful and timid about incision with a blade, then take a well-made leaden thread and tie it around the mole: its method is as we have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add to the constriction of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore do not cease to tie the lead, whenever it presses on the mole, until it is cut off and falls away by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 But if the mole is of a large root, then there is something fearful and dreadful about its incision, especially that which is in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 Nevertheless, it is possible for you to incise half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.  />
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then treat it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And beware of presuming to incise a mole that is black in color, has little sensation, and is ugly in appearance; for it is a cancerous abscess, and I will discuss Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 § On the treatment of umbilical hernia.
Caput LII.	 Chapter 52.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 Umbilical hernia occurs for many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 Or from the fissures that are above the abdomen; and an altheb or intestine protrudes from it, just as occurs in other hernias.  />  />
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 Or from blood that flows out of a vein or artery, as has been stated above.  />  />  />  •
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 Or from constriction of the bowel at that point.  />  •  />
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 But if it is due to a fissure of the peritoneum and protrusion of fatty tissue, then its color resembles that of the body; it is soft, without pain, and appears in various forms.  />  •  />  />  •  />  >
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the evacuation of the intestine, then its condition is, along with what we have narrated, more severe in its diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 When you press it with your fingers, it hides; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it becomes very prominent at the entrance to the bath, and causes great labor.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 If, however, it is due to moisture, it is mild; then it does not hide when you press it with your hand, nor does it constrict, nor does it increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood, then along with these signs an abscess appears in the form of a blackish swelling.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is due to rotting flesh, then the abscess is heavy, large, hard, and settles in one place.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 If, however, it is due to gaseousness, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the treatment in that case is that you should then consider whether the swelling of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or gaseousness; then it is necessary for you to refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is danger and fear in that, as I have taught you in the chapter where I spoke about abscesses due to an artery or vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 But if the swelling of the navel is due to the intestine or bladder, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath and stand upright and extended.  />   If you do not do this, he will die quickly, as I have informed you in the preceding chapter about a patient who died because he did not hold his breath.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then mark the signs around the entire circumference of the navel with cautery.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 After that, tell him to turn over onto his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then surround with a wide spatula the place around the navel where you marked with cautery.  />   After that, tell him to turn over onto his stomach between your hands.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Then extend the middle of the abscess upward with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind it around firmly with thread or strong silk cord; let the knot of the binding be loose.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the bandage.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If you find that it has already been caught by the bandage, then pull out the loose part and insert your index finger into it; push the intestine back into the abdomen. And if you find a hernia, then take hold of it with the hook and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 But if an artery or vein is opposite to you, then circle around it often.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your task.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 Take two needles and thread two strong threads on them; then introduce the two needles into the circle you have made around the abscess in the form of a cross, making them penetrate through.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then bind the abscess in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave it alone until the extended flesh putrefies and falls away by itself; or cut it when it softens and putrefies.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with the necessary ointments until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 But if the protuberance of the navel is due to fleshiness or moisture, then it is necessary that you make a concave incision in the abscess, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And extract the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then treat it with what strengthens the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 ¶ On the treatment of CANCER.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have already spoken in the classification of the kinds of cancer and how to approach its treatment with medicines; and one must be careful in its treatment with iron, so that it does not ulcerate. And we have spoken about cancer generated in the womb and the caution in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to remove it: such as cancer of the breast or thigh, and similar places, from the limbs for removing all of it; especially when it is small and beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 But if it has become chronic and is large, you should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I have not been able to cure anyone from it; nor did I ever see anyone before me who reached that [stage].
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when located as we have said, is that you precede it and dissolve the patient with black bile frequently.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then bloodletting of the patient if a young man with obvious congestion.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the patient for preparation, in which he is located during the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then cast hooks into the cancer that fit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood run, and do not cut it quickly, but press on the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever is possible there among the instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if the flow of thick blood from the cutting of an artery or vein gives you trouble, then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with the remaining treatment, until he heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 § On treating dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter 45.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We have already narrated in the division of the types of dropsy, and how the water accumulates; and the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines. 》
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And that which is treated with iron is only the sole type of ascites; and the type of tympanites is not approached with iron, nor the type of hypochondriac dropsy at all; for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you have treated this species of hydrocephalus with medicines and your treatment has not helped, then consider
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 For if the patient has already become weak, or there is another disease with him besides hydrocephalus, such as coughing, or loosening of the bowels, and similar things, then be careful not to treat him with iron, for it is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 But if you see that the patient is of strong constitution and there is no other disease with him except hydrocephalus alone, and he is neither a boy nor an old man, then the manner of operating on him is as follows: You raise the patient standing between your hands, and an assistant behind him presses his abdomen with his hand, forcing the water down to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a thorny sponge, in this manner.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 It should be of two sharp points, long, with a sharp end like a little sponge.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, there should be something of gradual narrowness in it, so that you do not penetrate with it during the operation all the way to the intestine and injure it.
Deinde considera.	 Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if the hydrocephalus is generated from the part of the intestines, then you must extend the cut with a section from the navel for the length of three fingers, downwards directly above the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 But if the hydrocephalus is generated on account of liver disease, then your cut should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 And if its origin is on account of the spleen, then let the cut be on the right side; and it should not even be on the side where the patient wishes to lie, so that the superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then pierce the whole skin with the instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then introduce the sponge into that section, and lift your hand with the sponge under the skin, as if you are removing it; and let the amount that is removed be the size of a nail or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then pierce the tissues until you reach an empty space, which is a place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then extract it and insert this tool into the opening, whose shape is as follows.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 And it is similar to a tube; it is made of silver, bronze, or brass, smooth and polished. At its lower end there is a small opening, and on its sides there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other. And the tip of it is cut in the manner of cutting a reed, as you see; at its upper end there is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the tool reaches the water, then the fluid immediately rises over the tool; therefore, draw out of the water half a measure's quantity per hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 Because if you draw out of it more than is necessary, the patient may die within the hour through the dissipation of his vital spirit; or he may fall into a swoon that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 Truly, draw out of it according to the strength of it and according to what the condition of the patient indicates to you from the strength of his pulse and from its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the tool and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 That is, because it is immediately retained due to the skin which retains the opening that is above the tissue; about which I have told you to pierce it in that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then repeat the procedure with the tool on the following day, if you see the patient tolerating it; and draw out from the water also a small quantity.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself against error; until there remains from the water only a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 But if you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of fluid, then care for him with burial in hot sand, and much sweating in the bath and sunlight, and let him expect thirst; and care for him with drying medicines until he is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, spleen, and liver after drawing out the water; as I have told you in what has preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 On the care of infants born with their urethral openings not pierced through.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When any infant comes out of its mother's womb and its penis is not pierced through, or there is a narrow opening, or it is in the wrong place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, one must immediately assist with its perforation at birth using a very fine sound, in the following manner.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a fine lead weight into the opening and tie it on: and hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 Therefore, when he wishes to release his urine, remove it and let him urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then replace it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine which comes upon that spot will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 The one whose opening is narrow should be treated with lead as we said, for many days, until it opens up.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 That is to say, because in those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis, so he cannot urinate forward until he raises his penis with his hand upwards. ‌
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 Nor can he have intercourse, for the semen cannot reach the womb directly; and it is very offensive. ‌ ‌
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the manner of operating on him is that the patient be turned onto his back. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend his penis with your left hand using a strong extension, and cut off the head of the penis from the location of the glans with a needle or sharp sound, like when you cut a reed, or as if you are shaving something, so that its middle part becomes similar to the head of the penis; and let the opening fall in the middle as it should.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And beware of blood loss during your procedure.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 For this often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, stop the bleeding with what you used to cut, and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 About whiteheads that occur on the foreskin and head of the penis, and about pus, blackening, and adhesions.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 66.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 These whiteheads often occur on the penis, and they are foul-smelling lumps of flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And some are malignant, while others are not.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore, you should cut away the benign one with a fine hook until you have completely cleaned it out. ))) ))))
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then place on it a piece of cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the area with diafincion ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 But if the whitehead is malignant and foul-smelling, then you should apply a cautery to it after cutting it open and removing its core. ))) )))) )))
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 But if the whitehead is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised man and part of it is inside the foreskin while another part is outside: then you should remove the inner part of the whitehead first, until it has healed; only then should you care for the outer part. Because when you care for both parts at once, the foreskin may be damaged and retracted. )))
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 Blackening and corruption also occur on the scrotum and foreskin. ))) )))) )))) ))) )))
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, you should cut out all that has blackened or is about to decay or has already decayed. )))
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then apply to the area a mixture of pounded honey with ground-up cornflour and sifted crushed herbs. ))) ))))
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. ))) )))) ))) )))
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 If there is a flow of blood, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery in this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 A cautery is beneficial for two conditions at the same time: namely for a flow of blood and for a wound when it becomes corrupt.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 But if the tip of the rod is corroded and destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary that you insert a lead pipe into the meatus of the penis so that the patient urinates onto it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 In the case of adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, this adhesion does not occur except in a man whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required for him; and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess: Therefore, it is necessary that you scrape it off with a blunt spatula until the ligament dissolves and the head of the penis is freed from every part. ︎
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 But if it is difficult to discern these carefully, then it is necessary that you scrape off a little from the head of the penis and the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 This is because when the foreskin is thin, it may be quickly perforated due to its very thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it should be scraped with astringent wine until it heals.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 ¶ On the cleaning of infants and their treatment when they err.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is by our operation, by our will, and its use is proper for children, it is necessary that we mark in it a better operation and a lighter way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 I say therefore that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, since they do not use it in their laws, and there is nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 For I have found that most artisans and bloodletters use cleaning, cutting with a razor, and using scissors; and they use cauterization and tying with thread, and cutting with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And indeed, I have already tested all these methods, and I found no better one than cleaning with scissors and tying with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Since in cleaning with a razor, the skin often slips away.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers; therefore, perhaps the upper layer is cut and the lower one remains; thus it will be necessary to proceed with cutting the other one, and there will be future pain.  />
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And with cleaning done by cauterization, that is, by the digitus which shoemakers use, the cutting of the end of the male member is not secure; since perhaps it enters into its hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 But in cleaning with a nail, perhaps the iron slips away and ruins your operation; and indeed, the skin of a child is short by nature, and often they are born in such a way that they do not need cleaning; and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 But cleaning with scissors and tying with thread has shown me to be a good experiment; since the scissors are proportionate to the incision; because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 When therefore you place your hand thus, the two sharpnesses are proportionate, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a compression of similar shape is made, containing the skin from all parts, with which no error falls at all.  />  />
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 And the manner of operation is this: make the boy estimate, especially if he is one of those who understands a little, that you do not do anything unless you tie a thread on his rod only; and leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him rejoice and be glad as much as you can, because he receives his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand between your prepared hands and do not let him sit; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then introduce your hand to his rod and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the rod comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then cleanse it because filth will gather upon it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then bind the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 After that, bind below it slightly with the second tie.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower tie firmly, and cut between the two ties.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then quickly lift up the skin and pull out the head of the rod.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow out slowly (for this is better) and place powder on top of it; and over the powder a cloth in which a cooked egg yolk has been spread with fresh good rose oil that has been mixed together: and leave him on it until another day, and care for him with the remaining treatment until he is cured.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The form of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 Let there be two blunt ends and let them meet; so that the branch of the nail does not stick out in them; and let the length of the two sharp parts be equal to the length of the handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 The error falling in cleansing is this: because perhaps all or part of the inner skin escaped at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, you should stretch it with your nail at the appointed hour before the swelling of the place, and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 But if three days have passed and the swelling under the rod remains inflamed and swollen, then leave it alone until the hot swelling subsides; then scrape it off with ease, cut it as prepared for you, and beware of the tip of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 For that will not harm him.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Take care of it with what heals wounds from the powders that we have described in the treatise on powders; and if it is cut too deeply through the skin and reaches the upper parts, that will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore take care of it with what we have said, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 ¶ Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by a stone made from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh, and similar things as we have said in the modes of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if the urine does not dissolve and you see that its retention is due to a stone already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary for him to be bent over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then let his feet be placed on his back, and let him stretch his belly from the top of his back, and let the patient hold his breath as much as possible for him.  Bible in Latin
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 Therefore he is forced with the neck of the bladder to expel the stone toward the rear, wherefore the urine is freed.  Bible in Latin  Bible in Latin
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 But if it does not dissolve with what we have said and the matter is severe for the patient, then you must administer its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: Let it be made of silver and be fine, smooth, hollow like a feather quill in delicacy, long like a hand and a half; to which there should be a fine tube at its end.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the way of the exit of urine through it is that you take a doubled thread and tie wool or cotton to its end with a good ligature: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut off any excess wool with scissors, but forcefully insert it into the cannula, as alzer.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and the white of an egg: and make the sick person sit on a seat, and pack the bladder, and its rod with moistened oils and olive oil and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then insert the syringe into the rod easily, until it reaches the base of the rod.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then fold it upwards from the navel part.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the syringe inside, until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has now reached an empty space: and this is not done according to this order, unless because the passage through which it goes is where there is a curvature.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then gradually extend the thread with the wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 For urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then draw it out and let the urine run through its path: and repeat with the syringe, and do not stop doing this, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 ¶ On the method of irrigating the bladder with a syringe.
Caput LIX.	 Chapter 59.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals therein, or pus becomes hardened within it, and one wishes to distill waters and medicines into it: then let it be done with an instrument called a Clepshydra, and this is its form.  (Albucasis on Surgery, trans. by Donald Campbell)
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 For it is closed, that is to say, it is sealed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And in it there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And the hollow place where that which drives is located should be according to its size without addition, until when it draws something with it from moisture, moisture is drawn: and when it is driven, with it what is far off is expelled; just as a clepsydra does, by means of which naphtha, which is Greek fire, is projected in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 When you want to project moisture into the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and draw it along with what drives upwards; for moisture is drawn into the hollow of the syringe.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then insert its tip into a tube, as we have described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then drive the moisture along with what drives it; for that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The form of a thin enema by which the bladder is irrigated.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Let it be made of silver or brass; and let its tip be similar to a small onion, and below that let there be a pouch into which the thread falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take a sheep's bladder and place in it the moisture with which you want to irrigate the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie it between two pouches with a strong double thread; and warm that moisture a little over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then insert the tip of the enema into a tube; afterwards place your hand over the bladder with the moisture in a moderate constriction until the patient feels that that moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 But if a bladder is not available to you, then take a piece of parchment and make from it a circle, and pierce it all around its circumference.  /> Then tie the ends of that thread on either side of the perforated parchment with a strong knot; and place that moisture in the middle of the parchment; and do what you have been told about irrigation.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then introduce a thread through those holes, as they are rolled up.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then make a ball like an apple; after you have placed on it what you wish from the moist substances and oils and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then bind it to the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder when squeezing it by hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 ¶ About the Removal of a Stone.
Caput LX.	 Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have already spoken of the types of stone and its treatment with medicines, and we mentioned the difference between stones generated in the kidneys, the bladder, and all their signs; and we spoke about the stone on which the operation by hand and incision works, and that is properly a stone generated in the bladder, and the one that fixes itself to the urethra. And I am explaining this with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder most often happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And its sign is that the urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety, and white sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his penis, and struggles with it, and often dribbles.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then he becomes erect, and the anus protrudes in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And boys are easy to cure from that time until they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 And it is difficult in old men.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 But in young men it is intermediate, in that if the stone is larger, the cure is easier; but if it is small, its treatment is difficult.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 Therefore, when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with an enema, which should draw out all the excrement that is in his intestines; for this sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during the search.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then let the patient be taken with his feet, and shaken, and moved downwards: so that the stone may descend to the depth of the bladder, or jump out from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his own thighs, so that the entire bladder may become inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine him, and touch him from the outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If indeed you feel the stone in a space, then hasten immediately with a cut over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wash the index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a boy; or the middle finger, if he is an adult man, and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it stands under your finger: and turn him little by little towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press over it with your finger, and push it outwards towards the place where you want to make the incision; and instruct an assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand to move away the skin that is under the testicles from the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert a sharp instrument of this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left buttock: and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the external part of the incision may be wide, and the internal part narrow, according to what is possible for the passage of the stone out of it not being greater. ‌
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 For perhaps the finger that is in the anus may press the stone at the incision, and it goes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that it is from stone which has angles and edges, therefore its outlet is difficult because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And it is smooth, similar to a little ball, and round; and its outlet becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 Therefore, for the one which has angles and edges, add into a crack.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not exit in this way, then you must create an opening above it; or tie a knot around it neatly, whose end is like the moon, which should hold the stone and not let it escape from there; or insert beneath it a thin instrument with a curved tip.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If, however, you cannot do so above it, then slightly enlarge the opening.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If anything overcomes you from bleeding, cut it off with a thread.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 But if the stone is more than one, then first expel the larger one towards the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then make an incision above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Afterwards, push the smaller one after that; and do similarly if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, it is ignorance to make an incision above it with a large cut.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Because one of two things happens to the patient, either that he dies, or continuous dribbling of urine occurs; therefore, because the place does not heal at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 Truly, administer its expulsion until it comes out; or make an opening in its fracture with scissors, until you extract it bit by bit.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with incense, aloe, and dragon's blood; and tie it off, and place upon it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil and cold water; to treat a hot abscess.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then place the patient on their back over their shoulder, and do not loosen the tie until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you have loosened it, rinse the place with water and a lot of oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with diaphanic ointment and basilicum ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 However, if it happens that in a wound there is added an abscess of heat and ulceration, similar to when blood clots in the bladder and urine is blocked from it, and this is known from the emission of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then wash the wound with vinegar and water and salt. And apply every kind of ointment suitable for its treatment until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And during the entire time of treatment, you should bind two thighs together to hold the medicines that are placed on the site.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and it is stuck in the channel of the urethra and blocks the passage of urine, then treat it with that which I have previously mentioned before you proceed to cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For often you will be relieved of cutting through this treatment, for I have already proven its effectiveness.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And it is necessary that you take a perforating tool made of steel, with this form: triangular at the end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread and tie it to the rod beneath the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the piercing iron into the rod easily until the perforator reaches the stone itself, and gradually turn the perforator by hand in the stone, and you will try to make a hole in it until you cause it to penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 For immediately urine is freed.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outer part of the rod.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 For it breaks up and comes out with the urine, and the patient is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 But if this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut over the stone on the rod itself between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Afterwards, loosen the bandage and clean the frozen blood that forms at the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone unless to prevent it from returning to the bladder; and another thread above, unless so that when the thread is untied after the passage of the stone, the skin may return to its place and cover the wound; and for this reason it is necessary for you when tying the thread above to raise the skin upward, so that it returns in its entirety and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 About the removal of stones in women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 Stones are rarely formed in women. />
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 But if it happens that a woman gets a stone, then the treatment is difficult and is hindered by many factors.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One of them is that the woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And another factor is that you cannot find a woman who will expose herself to a doctor when she is chaste or has a husband.  />  Et si inuenies illam raro et difficulter.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 The third factor is that you cannot find a woman well-versed in this skill, especially the manual operation.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And the fourth factor is the distance from the site of the stone, which requires deep incision and involves fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If necessity calls for it, then you must have a woman doctor who is skilled; and such a one is rarely found.   Si autem necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 If indeed you lack such things, then seek a clean, skilled physician and a present midwife well-versed in women's matters or a woman who is knowledgeable in this art; make her present and especially instruct her to do everything that you command her after the examination of the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 First, observe whether the woman is a virgin; then it is necessary that she insert her finger into her anus and seek for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If she finds it, let her squeeze it with her finger. Then command the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vulva and examine the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it firmly.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength until it reaches the hip joint.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then make an incision over it on the opposite side of the vulva at the hip joint, whichever part is prepared for her and where she feels the stone; and let her finger not be moved away from the stone, squeezing it tightly beneath; and let the incision be small at first. )))
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then insert a probe over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If she feels the stone, then enlarge the incision according to the proportion by which the stone exits from her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 Among these are those that are small and large, smooth and rough, long, round, and branched. )))
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Know therefore its types, so that you may be informed about it as you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood overpowers you, then add ground fenugreek to the place and hold it for one hour until the bleeding stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and make sure you have ready with you from the instruments which I mentioned for extracting stones in men, so that you may assist yourself with them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If you are overwhelmed by the flow of blood and know that the bleeding is from the cut artery, then place dust over the site and bind it with a decent ligature: and do not change it; and leave the stone and do not remove it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps a weak woman may die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 Therefore, when the sharpness of the blood subsides after a few days and the site begins to fester, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 § On incision for hydrocele.
Caput LXII.	 Chapter 62
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A watery hernia is not anything other than a collection of fluid in the white sac, which contains the testicle and is under the skin: and it is called a sac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it is in the proper membrane which nature has prepared for the testicle in its own part, until it becomes swollen; that is another sac, and it is between the white sac which we mentioned and the skin of the testicle, and this only happens rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 And indeed the formation of this hernia is from a weakness that befalls the testicles, wherefore this material flows to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles. ‌
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 And this fluid has many colors. ‌ ‌ ‌
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 For its color either tends toward yellowish, or it is blood-red, or dirty black, or it can be watery white; and the latter is most common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And the signs by which you know where the collection of fluid is, are these. ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 For if it is in the white sac which we mentioned, then the swelling is round to a certain length like the shape of an egg; and the testicle does not appear, since the fluid holds it on all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 And if there is moisture in its own cloth, then the abscess is round with a part of an egg, and therefore man thinks that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 And if there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the membrane around the testes, then it is not perceptible.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 Therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, then try the color of the moisture in the abscess with the previously described square instrument.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 According to that which comes out in the trace of the inserted [instrument], judge what is between them.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When we come to the treatment with iron [i.e., cautery], then it is necessary that you instruct the patient that he should be bled if possible for him, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then let him lie on his back over a slightly elevated object, and place many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then sit on his left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on his right side, who should stretch the member towards one of the two sides of the scrotal skin and towards the edge of the abdomen.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a wide spatula and cut the skin of the scrotum lengthwise from the middle to near the penis, and let the incision be straight along an equidistant line that divides the scrotal skin, until it reaches the membrane around the testes enclosing it: and excoriate it and observe, or be careful not to cut it: and let your excoriation by which you excoriate it be from the side that hangs with the egg more, and search subtly with the excoriation according to what is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then pierce the full membrane around the testes with a large opening and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks and extend the membrane upwards, but do not touch the scrotal skin enclosing it: and cut the membrane in whatever way you can cut it, either entirely or piecemeal, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 Indeed, if you do not carefully examine it, there is no certainty that water will not return upon its incision.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 But if the egg proceeds outward from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision, return it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then unite the two lips of the scrotal skin with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him as you would other wounds until he is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 But if you find a putrid egg from blackness or other means, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are the suspension, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then cut off the testicle with its suspending ligament and extract the egg; afterwards treat it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 But if water has gathered in two parts, then know that there are two branches; cut the other part equally as you did with the first.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it appears to you that the operation is one, then do so; afterwards remove the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose-scented oil; and place outward another wool that you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles and the navel; and place above double cloths, and they are soft; and tie them above with a ligature which has six, in this form. ➤
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then two cloths should be taken and wrung out, and filled with flax soaked in wine, according to this manner: and their ends which are pressed from cotton or wet wool; and they should be gathered together with a bandage in the lower part of the loins: and one end should extend from the anus up to the back, and the second from the pubic region: and two ends below on both thighs, and two other ends above on both groins, and let the whole bandage be gathered together in the lower part of the loins.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes this pampiniformis is treated artificially with a caustic in place of a surgical cut with iron: and it is done by taking a thin, sharp cautery, and cutting the skin of the testicles with it; and it is heated as we have said; until, when the white membrane containing water appears, then take a cautery of this shape.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 It resembles the Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then pierce that membrane with it, and heat until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then stretch that membrane with hooks and remove it with a thin heated cautery, and cut it as much as you can until you completely excise it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And beware of the egg, lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this operation is safer, and less likely to cause bleeding, and better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 But if it causes a problem at the time of cutting or heating, such as a hot abscess, bleeding, or anything else, then you should treat that problem with the appropriate treatment, as mentioned before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 But if the patient is timid and cannot endure this operation because of its horror, then perform a puncture as I describe it, which is:
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When you are certain from the signs that we have mentioned about their meanings, that the pampiniformis is watery, then it is necessary to make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then puncture the abscess at its lower part with a wide spatula; and make the puncture along the length of the body, and let the opening be large until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place a compress on the wound and bind it; and let the patient sit so that any remaining water can drain; then care for him until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If however there is obstruction to the exit of water at the time you perforate it; and this is only because the white membrane causes an obstruction at the wound's opening and prevents the water from exiting, then it is necessary that you introduce a feather into the wound, or the instrument with which water is extracted from dropsical patients, of which the shape precedes; or add a little to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that water returns and accumulates after six months, or thereabouts.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 Therefore, when it accumulates, then it should be punctured in the same manner, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 ¶ On the Treatment of Flesh Wounds
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter LXIII
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that in the cutting of this flesh wound, there is fear of leading to death in many situations.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore, it seems to me that its dismissal will be saved from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I am remembering the procedure on it and the appearance of the abscess. 》
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the body, from which testicles are formed; and this happens for many reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or from an acute or sharp overflow that is poured out onto the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and the abscess is serious.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation of it. 》 》
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it occurs from the knotting and swelling of the arteries, as has been mentioned before; or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 Therefore, that which is from them and occurs due to the swelling of the arteries can be recognized by the arrangement of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And you should not touch it at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 But that which is caused by the inflammation of veins, nothing is dispersed from it during compression with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And now it is possible to perform a section on this type and on the other flesh: namely, to excise the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then extend the ovum upwards and extract it with the white siphak; free the suspensor from the vessel, tie the vessel, and cut the suspensor after you have freed it from all parts of the ovum.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 Therefore, if the ovum is conjoined with those born flesh, then it is necessary to draw out the ovum and cut into it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is any adhesion between the ovum and the siphak or between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut into it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 But if there is a birth of flesh in the place of the adhesion behind it, then it is necessary to cut out all that and extract the ovum as we have said.  /// The medieval Latin text "Albucasis on Surgery" (Latin: Kitāb al-Tasrīf li-man ʿAjiz ʿan al-taʿlīf) is a translation of the 10th century Arabic medical text by Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn Abbas Al-Zahrawi, also known as Albucasis. This passage describes the procedure for extracting an ovum (possibly a cyst or abscess) that is adhered to surrounding tissue. The instructions include extending and drawing out the ovum, freeing it from any adhesions, and making round incisions as necessary.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when your operation is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the usual treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 ¶ On the treatment of rams, which are with goats.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 The goat has a swelling wrapped in a certain wrapping, similar to a grape cluster, with softening of the testicles; and there is difficulty in moving, exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this illness, one should be cautious, because of what was mentioned earlier.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 Truly, we must say that its operation is according to what the first [surgeons] did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore, I say that it is necessary for you to make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then, push the scrotum downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then, with your fingers, hold the skin of the scrotum together with the vessels that are close to the penis; and let another assistant hold them, and stretch them with great force.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then, cut with a sharp, broad scalpel across the vessels directly until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then, scrape [the vessels] from all sides, as we have told you in the extraction of the temporal arteries.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then, insert into them a needle with a double thread, and tie it first at the place where the veins meet; and then tie it again at their end.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then, cut them along the middle line following the length of the body, and remove what accumulates from foul, corrupted humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then, treat the wound as you would other wounds, in which there is power to generate pus, so that the vessels nourishing one of the testicles may fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 For it is not harmful through this [procedure].
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 But if the veins are attached to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed with them; so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and it rots or dries up, and there is no benefit from them [the testicles].  />
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 ¶ On the treatment of intestinal worms.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The onset of these worms is due to a cutting that occurs in the groin when extending the intestine over the abdomen during laparotomy.  /> />  Note: "laparotomy" is used here as a translation for the Arabic term "mirach," which refers to a surgical incision into the abdominal cavity.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from a hernia or from its stretching.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 And these two types occur for many reasons: either from a blow, or from a jump, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy thing, and similar causes.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And the sign, when it is from stretching of the hernia.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It happens gradually over a long time, and not suddenly; and it is an equal swelling towards the depth, because the hernia compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And its sign when it is from cutting of the hernia, because it causes a sudden, severe pain at the beginning; and it is a different swelling, appearing close to the skin: and this is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the outside of the hernia. xspace
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it exits with the intestine, an omentum; and this is called hernia of the intestines and omentum; and sometimes it occurs with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes feces run into the intestine and are retained there; and with it is the danger of the sick person; because it causes a painful swelling, especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in treating these types of illness with iron, there is danger; therefore, one must be careful to avoid this happening.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 And the method of treatment is that you should instruct the sick person to return the intestine with his own hand to the inside of his abdomen, if it obeys and returns.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he should be made to lie on his back between your hands, and you should raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then stretch the skin that follows the other skin towards above, and cut the entire skin of the testicles along their length. xspace
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then place hooks in the two lips of the incision, as you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be such that it is possible for an egg to pass through it.  xspace xthe operation should not be done on a full stomach, nor on an empty one; rather, when the intestines are neither too full nor too empty.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the scrotum and what is under the skin of the testicles until when the white sac is exposed, hard on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, between the white sac that is under the skin of the egg and the second sac, and separate with it the adhesion that is at the back of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then with the right hand move towards the interior of the skin of the testicles; and with this extend the white sac upwards with the left hand; and lift the egg with its sac to the section area; and command your assistant to raise the egg up; and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind upon completion.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And search with your fingers so that there is nothing there of the intestine wrapped in the hard white sac.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If however you find something from it, then push it down to the belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take a needle with a thick thread, made of ten threads; and insert it at the last sac, that is, the tunica which is under the skin of the testicles following the section; then cut off the ends that protrude from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then arrange some of them over others in the shape of a cross; and tie with them the sac about which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, so that nothing from the vessels that nourish them may be sent to them; lest a hot abscess arise from there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place another ligature outside the first ligature, more distant by two fingers' width.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligatures cut from the sac that is under the skin of the testicles a quantity equal to the size of a finger; and cut the rest completely around in a circle, and remove the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then cut the skin of the testicles in the lower part where blood and pus flow out, as we have mentioned previously.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound and use the bandage that we have mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes cauterize the white sifach that we have mentioned after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 And leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 But if its fall is delayed, then soak it in warm water and place the aforementioned [herb] on it until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then treat the wound with the usual treatment for wounds until it is cured.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 ¶ On Ventose Ramica.
Caput LXVI.	 Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this case of ventose ramica, I have not seen anyone who dares to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And the first ones said that it is treated as we have mentioned in the case of ramica with Vite.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Which is to say that after the incision, place the bandage below with ease; then cut in the middle and treat it lastly with what opens it up until the vessels fall off; and treat the wound as we have said until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 ¶ On Disruption that Occurs in the Groin.
Caput LXVII.	 Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the place protrudes, and nothing comes out from the intestines to the testicles; and if something does come out, it is little and returns at all times; but if this persists for a long time, a fissure is added in the sifach until the intestine descends into the sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 And this happens due to the expansion of the sifach that is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 "The reason is that the skin is stretched; then it becomes soft and swollen, and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 "And its treatment is with a cautery, as was previously stated in its description.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 "And sometimes it is treated with an iron instrument in this manner: the patient should lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 "Then cut the swollen and protruding area of the rupture with a transverse incision, the length of which should be three fingers wide.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 "Then tie off the skin and what lies beneath it until the white skin that follows is exposed.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 "Then take a needle and place it on the protruding part of the skin, pressing it down into the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 "Then if there are two protruding parts on the skin at the end of the needle, join them together with a stitch; then pull out the end of the needle.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 "And do not cut the skin at all, nor draw out any pus or other matter, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal adhesions.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 "Then treat it with wound care.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 "Therefore, when you cut the threads, cleanse the area and close the wound until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 "For the skin contracts, and no further protrusion of the rupture occurs.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 "And the use of a cautery is better in this case because it is closer to healing.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 "About softening the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 "The skin of the testicles often becomes soft in certain people, and because of this, the meat between them becomes softened, and their appearance is disfigured.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 "Therefore, it is necessary for the one asked to treat this that he make the patient lie on his back and cut away all the softened skin down to the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then gather the two lips with a stitch: and if you wish, first remove the excess skin with three or four stitches, and make the stitch firm.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then care for the healing of the remaining wounds until they heal and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	 § On Castration
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 Know that castration in our law is excommunicated: and because of this I might not mention it in this book of mine; and there would be no need to mention it except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One is so that it may be within the knowledge of a doctor when he is asked about it; and so that he may know how to treat the one to whom it has happened.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And the other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals for our benefit, such as rams, donkeys, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 I say therefore that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	 Either by crushing.  ...or by cutting.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by tearing and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In that which is done by crushing, the way of the operation is this: that we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles become soft and relaxed and hang down; then crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not felt under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 However, in castration by tearing and cutting, it is necessary for you to hold the animal and press its skin on its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut above each testicle with a single cut until two testicles come out; then cut them after you have skinned both, and do not leave anything of the fat except for the fine fat which is on the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than that which is done by crushing; because crushing perhaps leaves something of the testicles, on account of which the animal desires coitus.  ...But the one done by cutting and tearing is safer for the animal.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then tend to the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 On the care of two types of hermaphrodites.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter 70
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 A hermaphrodite is from men in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is that it appears on what follows the space, or on the skin of the testicles, between two testicles, like a woman's vulva with hairs in it; and sometimes urine comes out from what is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 However, in women there is only one kind, and it is a woman's vulva above the pubis like very small male testicles protruding to the outside; one of them is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles. xspace
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And the treatment of these three kinds, two from men and one from women, is this: you should cut away the added flesh until their imprint disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then treat them with the same care as for other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 As for the second type of men, from which urine comes out, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation and it has no treatment at all. ️
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 ¶ On the incision of the dark spot and protruding flesh in women's labia.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 Perhaps a dark spot is added to the natural state until it becomes ugly and unpleasant to look at; and sometimes it becomes so large in some women that it spreads like in men, even reaching the point of intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, you should hold the excess of the dark spot with your hand or with a hook and cut it; and do not go too deep in the incision, especially at the root, so that bleeding does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with the same care as for other wounds until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 Protruding flesh is the flesh that grows in the opening of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it comes out to the outside like a tail, and because of this some ancients called it "tail disease.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 We should therefore cut it as we cut the tonsil and care for it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 Concerning the treatment of al-Ratidh, which is the woman's unperforated lip.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 The al-Ratidh is when the woman's lip is unperforated or has a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And it may be either congenital or acquired.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 The acquired form comes from an antecedent illness: it is caused either by a growth of flesh, or by a delicate or thick sifach (ulcer/sinus), and it may occur either deep in the womb, or on its sides, or at its upper or lower part; it prevents sexual intercourse, conception, childbirth, and possibly menstruation. ︎
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 Its diagnosis is made by the midwife's inspection if the swelling is apparent nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 But if the swelling is due to a delicate sifach and is close to the two lips, then hasten and break it up.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And it is done by placing small cushions on the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place the index fingers of both your hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then strongly stretch the two lips until the delicate sifach is broken and the swelling opens.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take wool, dip it in oil and place it on the spot; and let the woman sit every day so that the site does not heal again with a different kind of flesh.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 But if the sifach is thick and dense, then it should be cut away with a broad scalpel like a myrtle leaf. ︎ ︎ ︎
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 But if the swelling is due to a growth of flesh, then suspend it with hooks and cut it; and let there be with you medicines which staunch blood flow without causing tissue necrosis, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and cooked chickpeas with egg membrane. ︎ ︎
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a wide leaden tube so that the wound does not heal quickly; let her keep it for several days: and administer a bandage of dry linen, then proceed with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And sometimes a growth of other flesh occurs in the womb; it is therefore necessary to cut according to this method: while it is not a cancerous swelling, for with a cancerous swelling that is in the womb, there should be no contrariety whatsoever with iron.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 On the treatment of hemorrhoids, as well as Bothrus red in women's wounds.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Indeed, hemorrhoids are the opening of the mouths of veins, until much blood runs out from them continually.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 When hemorrhoids age, they become piles. And I have already said in the division of their types and signs. Here I will say what among them receives treatment and what does not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are at the mouth of the womb and do not appear to be sensible, then there is no treatment for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those which are at the mouth of the womb and upon which sensation falls, these can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 It is therefore necessary to introduce the woman into a cold room.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then extend the piles with scissors or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then sprinkle upon them at the time of bleeding from one powder made without boiling: like acacia and dragon's blood, henna, and similar to these.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Afterwards, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the bleeding persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peels and oak galls and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on its back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If therefore the blood is cut with it, that is good; and if not, make windy (plasters) stick to the back and breasts without scraping.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool and soak it in the juice of tamarind or the juice of sea-bass or the juice of laurel branches, that is, laurel berries, with Pontic wine, and make it stick to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when the abscess quiets down, then treat the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 Albarth, however, is similar to red onion bulbs and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore you should cut what appears from it, as I said about the lily, evenly; and treat it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 ¶ About the Perforation of the Uterus that Happens in the Womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 Many types of abscesses happen in the womb, such as cancer, lapis abscess, ulcers, adubelati (a type of skin lesion), alekilati (herpes), aestiomemus (a type of wound), fistulas, hemorrhoids, ragadiae (tears or fissures), thelil (a type of abscess), and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And I have already mentioned all these diseases and their types, and their signs, and their treatments in the section on division; it is necessary that I mention here the hot abscess that happens in the womb, when it is one of the abscesses that collect pus, and (I) wish to know how its opening with iron (is done).
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore you should consider.  />
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 Then if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is sharp with throbbing and burning and fever, and you see it redden; if this sense falls upon it, then do not hasten to pierce it; and treat it with what helps for maturation, until when the acuteness of the accidents quiets down.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then you should have the woman sit on a seat with two hollows, and lean back, or lie on her back, and draw up her feet towards her lower abdomen: her thighs should be spread apart, and she should place her arms under her knees, and each one should be tied with a suitable ligature.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument to open the vagina.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 The form of which is given in what follows.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And when you want to administer this instrument, you should first probe the depth of the woman's vagina with a reed, so that what enters from the instrument is not deeper than the depth of the vagina, and thus does not harm the patient.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If however the instrument is longer than the depth, then you should place wool over the depth of the vagina, so that the entire instrument does not enter into the depth of the vagina: and you should put a handle on the instrument from the upper side, and hold the instrument, and have an assistant turn the handle until the vagina is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When therefore the presenting part appears and is felt by the hand as soft and pliable, then you should cut it off at its head with a broad scalpel.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When therefore the blood has been evacuated, then you should put on the wound a linen bandage soaked in rose oil or green oil that has some styptic power: and put the bandage in place, and draw out the cut into the depth of the vagina.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And put on the outside over the vagina and over the pubic hair clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then let it be scraped after two days with a suitable ointment, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the vagina and wound are washed with water and honey enema; then with water in which lily root or long birthwort has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary to avoid treating it with iron; rather, treat it with what we mentioned in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 The teaching of midwives, how to care for live embryos that have exited abnormally.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter 70
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for the midwife to know first the shape of a normal delivery.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 Therefore the signs of a normal delivery are as follows: when you see the woman being pressed downwards, and she desires fresh air, and what is above her on the birthstool is relieved, and the embryo hastens to exit: then know that this delivery is according to the natural shape, and its exit is over its head, and with it comes the afterbirth, either suspended or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 Therefore, when you see these signs, it is necessary to press her abdomen so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 For when it descends over its head, the afterbirth follows with it, and is cleansed of those superfluities by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But that which is different from this delivery is unnatural and praiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 Because sometimes the fetus exits over its feet, and its body comes out before its head, or both of its feet, or one foot; or it exits with its head and hand; or its belly exits first; and perhaps it turns over its neck, and similar shapes are praiseworthy.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and astute in all these things, and to guard herself from error and deception; and I will show every shape of them, and what skill there is in that, and it will be indicated by that, and she will stand firm on that.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus exits over its head in its natural exit, and that becomes very difficult for the woman, and you see her strength already weakened: then make her sit on a stool, or let women hold her; and steam her vulva with cooked fenugreek and wet oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the midwife should insert a small sponge between her fingers and use it to dilate the cervix, and cut it with her nail until the moisture runs out of it; and press on the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 If it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage mixed with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then command her after the enema to be pressed on [the belly], and make her sneeze with pepper, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 For immediately the fetus will come out.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary that you reduce them back with ease little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If it does not obey at the entrance, then place the woman on a stool and lift her feet up; then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If therefore the hands do not come out and the fetus dies, then cut them off, and extract the rest of the fetus; and bind the hand with cloth, and extract it gradually; for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The exit of the embryo over its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus comes out over its feet, then it is necessary that you push them up; then gradually turn the fetus; and afterward equalize it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one of its legs and gradually straighten it.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they come out as far as the hips, then command her to be pressed on [the belly], and make her sneeze with pepper; for it will come out, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not come out with what we have described, then gradually reduce the fetus until you place it in its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For then it will come out with an easy exit. ›
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 If it is prevented by what we have narrated: then take mucilage of althea, oil of sesame, and dissolved gum, and pound all together in a mortar with good pounding; then apply it to the woman's wound and her lower abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until she reaches orgasm.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 When you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her a pessary of myrrh and insert it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When the pessary has been in place for one hour, then make her sit on a stool.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make her sneeze, and pinch her mouth and nose, and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 For the fetus will immediately come out.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 The exit of the fetus is between the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it exits in this manner, then she should insert her hands little by little. ¶ Vt accipiat ipsum.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then let the woman lie on her back and have her feet hang down; she should be lying on a bed, and wrap her hands together.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press gently above her abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then remove what is under her feet from the cushions until she is ready below.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them vigorously. ¶ Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim cum puluinare.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press gently above the hypogastrium until the fetus rises to the top.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then she should insert her hands and slowly draw out the fetus; and instruct the woman to press down until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 The exit of the fetus, hanging sideways from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 She should insert her hand for the delivery. ¶ Et scias quod sic fit in multis.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 If however he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 But if she cannot walk, then place her on a bed, and shake her legs strongly.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then apply the poultice that you have prepared from mucilage.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 But if she receives labor pains, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then proceed to reduce the hand and align the fetus according to its natural shape; make the woman sneeze and command her to bear down until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 ¶ The fetus exits over its neck, hands extended, and the face is towards the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The midwife should take hold of the fetus's hand, then gradually roll it over and align it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it is aligned, then place on its nose that which we have mentioned from oil and mucilage.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then command her to move little by little.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat and command her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then command her to bear down; and make her sneeze with you.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 ¶ The fetus comes out prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it descends to the uterine mouth in this manner with the amniotic sac, then cut the amnion with your nail until it is emptied of fluid.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If it hangs over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut from the navel so that it is not retained and does not die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus inside until you position it as needed; and command the woman to bear down several times, for it will exit easily. ///  The end of the text.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 ¶ The Birth of Twins or Many Fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 You should know that twins are often born, and sometimes three, and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 Yet this is unusual and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 But five is a thing outside of nature and they do not live at all; and the secondine holds them, although they multiply, by one; and they are separated by a siyafik, distinguishing between them a knot in the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they come out as one fetus comes out naturally and easily; and they come out through a praiseworthy exit, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them are difficult at birth and reach the unnatural figure which we have mentioned, then take care of them as we have narrated; and let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and contrive according to every figure with that which is prepared for her by an ingenious mind leading to health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 ¶ A remembrance of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes one is formed in the womb, and two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten; and indeed I have verified that a woman who aborted gave birth to seven, and another fifteen, all of them formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, all this ought to be in the knowledge of the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 For perhaps he will come upon something similar; therefore let him oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 ¶ On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you are treating a dead fetus with what I said about division through medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use an operation with the hand, then it is necessary for you to consider [the following].
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If the woman is of sound health and has none of the accidents that might cause her loss, then she must be placed on the bed on her back with her head tilted downwards and her legs raised; and a midwife should hold her by both parts or tie her to the bed so that her body is not drawn out during the extraction of the child.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then moisten the mouth of the womb with wet oils made from mucilage of hollyhock, fenugreek, and flax seed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should insert it into the womb gently.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then she should search for the place where she can insert the hooks into the child and suitable places for this.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Therefore consider if the child is ready to descend head first; then insert the hooks into its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under its chin, or on its chest, or near the ribs and under the armpits.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If the descent is by the feet, then in the pubic bone and mid-ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary that she should hold the hook with her right hand and place its curve between the fingers of her left hand; then she should insert it gently with her hand until she reaches a vacant spot.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then she should insert another hook or a third if needed opposite the first, so that there is an equal pull and it does not deviate to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then it should be pulled with equal extension, and not just straight; rather it should be moved in all directions to ease its passage, as is done with a tooth when pulling it.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And between that, it is necessary that the extension be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If part of it is retained, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them to turn out what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 Therefore, if part of the fetus emerges, then change the hooks to another place that is higher: do this until the whole fetus emerges.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 Therefore, if a hand comes out before the others and it is not possible to reduce it because of its swelling, then a cloth must be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then draw it out until the whole thing comes out; cut it either at the joint of the foot or at the elbow: and so you must do with the other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 But if the head of the fetus is large, or there is swelling at its exit, or there is water collected on its head; then the midwife must insert between the fingers a narrow spatula with spines and smooth out the head with it and extract the water; or break it with an instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of other instruments in the chapter that follows this one.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly, she should do the same if the fetus is naturally of large head; then it is necessary that she cut the membranes or extract it with a misdach, as we have said. ➤
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 But if the head emerges and is constricted at the chest; then it should be smoothed until the fluid that is in the chest comes out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 But if it does not pass and does not obey its exit; then cut off the head piece by piece as is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 But if there is a swelling below the belly or it has dropsy; then you must pierce it until the fluid runs out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 But if the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy and its direction towards the mouth of the womb is light. ➤ ➤ ➤
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If, however, it is constricted around the belly or chest: then you must extract it with the cloth that you have wrapped over your hand; and puncture the belly or chest until the contents run out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If, however, the other limbs are cut off and the head returns, then let the midwife insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 Therefore, if the mouth of the womb is open, let her insert her hand deep into the womb and search for the head with it; then draw it up with her fingers to the mouth of the womb; then introduce a hook or two hooks into it, and draw it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 But if the mouth of the womb is constricted because of a hot tumor that has occurred there: then it should not be labored upon, but rather a pessary of moist and fatty substances should be administered; and apply poultices; and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 But if the fetus is on its side, then it may turn; then administer what we have said for a live fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 But if that is not possible, then cut piece by piece and extract it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And you must not leave any part of the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 Therefore, when you have completed your work, then administer what we have said for hot tumors that occur in the womb.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 But if there is a flow of blood, then let her sit in waters that check bleeding, and administer the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 And indeed I have seen a woman whose womb had been pregnant with a dead fetus; then she became pregnant again in its place, and afterwards another fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 And so after a long time an abscess occurred at her navel, and it swelled until it opened up: and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I was called upon to treat him, and treated him for a long time; yet the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 Therefore, I placed over him certain plasters of strong drawing power, and an abscess came out from the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then some days passed, and another abscess came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 Therefore I marveled at this, since there is no abscess in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 I thought therefore that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I therefore examined the wound and extracted many bones, while the woman was in a good state; and she has since lived for a long time, although she still discharges a little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 And I would not have made mention of this strange occurrence, except that there is knowledge and assistance in it for what the physician-surgeon administers with his hand during treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 ¶ Concerning the forms of necessary instruments in extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here is the form of the forceps, by which books are made equal, having two handles at the ends of two pieces of wood equally.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 However, this handle ought to be thinner than the forceps, and to make it, take either from ebony or boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the width of all the wood is like two fingers; and the edge of each of both is like one finger, and the length of each is a palm and half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood there are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have been firmly fixed on both sides, whose length is more than half a palm. And the width of each is like two fingers or somewhat more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two additions are inserted into the opening of the womb, so that it may be opened with them when you turn the two handles.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The shape of vertigo which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another form similar to it, more subtle and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 It should be made of ebony or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 Nevertheless, at its end should be two attachments, as you see here above: and the length of each attachment is like a palm, and the width of both is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 When you wish to open the womb with it, then have the woman sit on the bed, with her feet hanging, and what is between her legs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two connected attachments into the womb, and you hold the end of the instrument below her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount you wish for the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 The shape of another kind of vertigo which the ancients called the pressing shape, by which the fetus is pressed out.  />
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The shape of Almisdac, by which the large head is crushed, and it resembles a forceps whose teeth are at its end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it is made elongated, like a forceps according to this shape, as you see, with teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it cuts and crushes.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The shape of Almisdac, by which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The form of a hook with one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The form of a hook with two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The shape of a forceps whose teeth are like a saw, by which the fetal head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The form of a spatula with two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The form of two wide spatulas.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 These instruments are all used, and the more their types are increased and prepared by the craftsman, the faster they are for their use, and higher in status among people due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not despise any of these instruments without having them prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 For their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 On the Extraction of the Fetus.
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the fetus is retained at birth, then you should advise the patient to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with you counting: and place your hand over her mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If it exits this way, that is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not: then take a pot and make a hole in its lid. And put into it herbs that open the womb, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, sesame, cinnamon, and centaury. Take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them in water, and place them over fire. 》
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place a reed over the hole of the pot’s lid, and its other end into the womb’s mouth. And let it stay until the vapor reaches the depth of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze as I said before.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 The fetus will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If after this treatment it remains and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil or thickened juice of fenugreek. 》 ︎ 》
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then she should insert into the vagina and seek the fetus with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When she finds it, then she should take it and gradually extend it.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 But if it is lodged deep in the womb, then she should insert her hand as we have described until she finds the fetus and gradually draws it out straight, so that the womb does not collapse from a strong pull. Rather, it should be turned gently to the right and left; then add to its size according to the degree of contraction. 》 ︎ 》 ︎ 》 ︎ 》 ︎
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 The wound then becomes supple, is preserved, and escapes from adhesions.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 If the uterine mouth is constricted, as we have already said: treat it with sneezing and the potion of the olla herb.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 But if it does not come out with all that we have said, then beware lest you tire yourself in the process of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 Indeed, it is necessary that whatever comes out to the mouth of the womb from her, you should tie it to the woman's thigh.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then enema her with tetrapharmacon ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 For this will cause it to putrefy after a few days and dissolve, and then come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 But when it putrefies, a bad smell will rise to the head and stomach of the sick woman and harm her. ›
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, it is necessary that suitable fumigations be administered for this.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of watercress and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated in cases of retained afterbirth and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Let it be made from a clay pot similar to alcama or from wax: and let its wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed on coals: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 ¶ On the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born with unperforated anuses, whose passages have already been blocked by fine membranes. › › ›
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, the midwife should pierce that membrane with her finger; and if she cannot, let her pierce it with a sharp needle, and beware of the testicle, lest she touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then place on it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointments until he is cured.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 But if you fear that it may close up again, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and it should be removed when the boy wants to pass water.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 It can also happen that the anus closes again due to the healing of a wound or the formation of a swelling.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, that healing must be cut out, and then it should be treated with what we have said regarding the treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 § On the Treatment of Fistulas That Occur in the Lower Part
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 The fistulas that occur in the lower part are called nodes and swellings that happen near the anus on the outside or within the space of a finger's width, and there is either one fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 When that node is opened, it opens up, and from it flows a watery white fluid or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, the penetrating ones are recognized by what comes out during defecation and flatulence when the patient uses defecation; and perhaps a worm comes out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And there are fistulas among them when they penetrate through the space to the bladder and to the opening of the penis.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And there are some that penetrate as far as the hip joint and to the base of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 But how to distinguish a fistula that penetrates as far as the anus from one that does not penetrate is that you should insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe made of iron or copper into the fistula, when it is not twisted.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 But if there is twisting in it, then insert into it a thin probe made of lead or a horse hair until you feel the probe or hair in your finger.  /> And know that when there is no connection between the fistula and the anus, it is not penetrating.  /> And if it has penetrated as far as the bladder, then the opening will be close to the penis.  /> And if it has penetrated into the space of the hip joint, then you will find a small nodule in the area of the hip joint.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 What if you do not feel it at all, and nothing comes out of the hole from discharge, nor is there wind or worms as I said; then know that it is not penetrating; so hurry to the cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the fistula extends to the bladder or to the passage of urine, then its indication is that urine comes out from it, and the prevention of this so that the place may be healed with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 But if it extends to the hip joint or to the head of the thigh, then its sign is that a probe reaches there, unless there is tortuosity in it up to the head; and the discovery of pain around the part, and that pus always comes out from it; and that no treatment helps, nor does it heal with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their cure is a useless endeavor for those foolish doctors on whom they are formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 But in that which is not penetrating and is not old, healing is hoped for with a saw; according to what I relate to you, and I have already proven it: and it is, as the patient lies between your hands on his back; and lift up his legs above his thighs, and let his thighs be inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then introduce a probe of lead or iron into the fistula, if there is tortuosity in it, until you know where the probe reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 But if the patient feels it around the anus, then your index finger should be introduced into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 So if you feel the probe already penetrate through itself, apart from what you sense between your finger and the fistula or flesh; then know certainly that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor over it, because there is no healing for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They said, however, that in certain people the flesh heals, and from the medication by which help is expected, it is as follows: you should make the cautery subtle according to the width of the fistula, as was said before, and insert the burning cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then repeat that two or three times, until you know that all those added flesh parts, which are similar to the quill of a feather, have already been burnt.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter until those burnt flesh parts come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and strengthen.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If it heals, that is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 And if the cord exits and does not reach your finger that is in the anus, and there is a thick veil of flesh or silk between it and the cord, and you see the fistula on its surface following the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula along with the cord in the fistula until the cutting reaches where the end of the cord reaches, and the cord is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then cleanse those thin flesh parts, which are similar to the quill of a feather, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 But if blood overpowers you and dissolves between you and your work so that you cut those flesh parts, then it is better for what happens, and quicker healing, to cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Because the cautery with fire brings about good results: it burns those added flesh parts, stops the flow of blood, and dries out the moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter or ground cabbage leaves until the place exudes pus and those burnt flesh parts exit with the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then care for the wound with healing ointments that produce hard flesh: and there are medicines which have astringency and drying properties.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when they are restored, then they are healed; and do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 But if the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus and is distant from the body's superfluity; then insert your finger into the anus and search with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 Therefore, if you feel a tentacle and there is a veil of cicatrix or flesh between you and it, and it is close to penetration; then there is no operation on that, except according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 Which is to say that in it one of three methods is administered: either you cauterize the fistula itself, as we have said; or you cut it until you reach its cavity, so that it may be possible for you to introduce a thread and perform the cure immediately afterwards.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed too much with cutting, lest you cut the ligament that holds the anus and cause a worse outcome of excretion unintentionally.  />
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 For perhaps it will heal; or you may remove the veil itself and cleanse it after cutting it almost up to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or with another instrument of sharp point.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then cleanse those fleshy parts that are in the cut, as far as you can reach with probing.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then strive to restore the entire wound with the cut and the upper opening where it is healed; and let the fistula remain open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter on the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes the fistula is treated in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus near the body's surface with skin and the edge of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like the needle aleskef, that is, prepared from leather, in this manner.  />  />  />
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And introduce a thread wrapped with five threads into it, and around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the probe along with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its hollow part.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it is penetrating into the margin of the anus on the inside near to it, then pull the thread out through that opening, so that you introduce your finger into the anus and pull out the end of the thread, and join both ends together; tie each one firmly, and leave it for one day or two days. And the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tie it tightly until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is cut off and falls away; then care for the wound until it heals and closes.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate by whatever method you prepare for yourself, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For it is not your task to do this because of the fleshy part, so that you do not cut into it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it as we have said until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The shape of the spatula with sharp points for opening a fistula, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is unnecessary, as you see. ›
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 About the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows after their incision, and the care for fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter 81
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 There are two types of hemorrhoids.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 For they are either inside the anus, like blisters of coal, or like grapes. › ›
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And from them are small and large ones; and blood always flows from them, sometimes one, sometimes many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 And they are outside the anus and at its ends.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those which are outside the anus are for the most part very small, from which flows yellowish water or a little blood with persistent flow; and they are of the same color as the body. › › › › ›
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And its treatment that is within the anus is to instruct the sick person to sit and be expressed until the anus emerges and the hemorrhoids appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, suspend them with hooks or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 But if hooks do not hold in them because of their moisture and softness, then take them with a rough cloth or with a linen pad made from double-layered wool, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them, and after cutting sprinkle on them some warm powders to act as a caustic.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or cauterize them according to what has been mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not obey its exit, then administer an enema to the sick person, in which there is a small amount of bitter substance, so that it cleanses what is in the anus and obeys quickly when the sick person expels himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If the hemorrhoids are external to the anus, then their case is light and easy; it is to take them with your nail or take them with a hook and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them as we said until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And he who is repulsed by the cutting with iron, then it is necessary for you to apply a bandage to them in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take a thread wrapped around, and insert it into a needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then draw out the hemorrhoids upwards, and make the needle penetrate its root from the other side; and wind the two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle, so that they are parallel; and bind the hemorrhoid tightly with a strong knot.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then tie off the thread, and withdraw the needle.  />  Et adhaerebit adhelil in loco suo, et non egredietur de loco suo: sed manebit in eo usque dum evanescat.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 This with all athelics, and let one of them go; do not let it sew itself, so that the superfluity of blood may flow from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or black oil over the anus and tell the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then leave it until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When the athelils fall off, care for them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 ¶ On the Treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For often fissures occur due to the drying out of feces and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 Therefore, when they become old and medicine does not work on them, then you must scrape them with the point of a Spatula or with your nail until they become moist, and remove the upper skin that prevents them from healing.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then treat them until they heal as necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 But if they do not heal, then scrape them more strongly than before until they bleed profusely, and then treat them until they heal. ›
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 ¶ On the Treatment of Inverted Hemorrhoids, and Non-Inverted; and Dry Athelics, and Threadworms.
Caput LXXXII.	 Chapter 82
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 Know that a hemorrhoid is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail, and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers, and walking causes pain from them.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut the part around the nail and hold it with forceps or a hook, and pull it out from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then treat it, and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said in its own chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 From dry athelics, one is a small, rough, thread-like, round prominence on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And often they happen in children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 And its cure is to stretch the skin and cut it, or tie it with a silk thread or hair until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you wish, cauterize it as described before with fire or sharp medicine; and thus the skin will be removed, both inverted and uninverted, using the tool that I shall describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 Also, a wart is a small, dense, protruding growth on the surface of the body, deeply rooted; and when cold touches it, there is a sensation like that of an ant bite, and this occurs throughout the body; and it most often occurs in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 And its cure is to take a small tube made of goose feather or strong vulture feather and place it over the wart until the circle of the tube encloses its edges.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then turn your hand with the tube until it cuts off what is around the wart, and you will place it deeply into the flesh, and thus you will remove the wart from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, do this with a tube of bronze or iron, following this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 Let the top of the tube be rounded to allow easy gripping and turning.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you wish, cauterize the wart as described before for the cauterization of skin in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 ¶ On the shapes of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus and for relieving flatulence and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter 83
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 Sometimes the enema is made of silver, or brass, or cast bronze, or hammered bronze.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes it is made from these instruments, both small and large, according to those who administer them.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 That which is administered for the treatment of small children should be small; and whose anuses are weak or painful, thus also their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	 Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	 Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The cannula should have its upper end, where the bladder is tied, wide according to this manner: and it should have a distinct narrowing so that the bladder can be tied as you see, and its lower tip which is inserted into the anus should be closed, i.e., not open, very smooth, drawing towards subtlety; and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the reeds, and slightly thicker; and let the bladder in which the medicines are placed be from the bladder of an animal or from sheepskin, which should be according to the shape of a small asofrat, whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And it should be perforated with many holes as described, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into those holes a thread made from raw silk, which should be made of ten threads or thereabouts, and tie the bladder to it like an asofrat.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 Therefore, when the bladder is placed inside, let the enema be tied at its neck with a strong knot between the two narrowings.  />
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then administer the enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the shape of the bladder's circle as depicted here, and its holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The method of administering the enema with it is as follows: fill the bladder or bag with medicine that has been warmed according to the patient's tolerance, and be careful not to make it very hot or very cold.  />  />  />
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the patient should lie on their back and lift their legs up; and place under them a carpet or cloth on which people sit or lie.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then anoint the tip of the enema with oil, or egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then introduce it into the anus easily.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then let the assistant take the bladder with both hands at once and squeeze it forcefully until all that is in the enema has been expelled into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the enema and let the patient raise their legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine urges him to defecate, then he should hold on as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps with it all night, it is better for his recovery.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 But if you enema him during bouts of diarrhea and his evacuation is swift: then repeat the enema until he is cured.  />
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 But if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the enema be very fine and gentle, like those used to enema children.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this is the form of a fine enema onto which a thin skin is stretched.  />
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 ¶ On the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 Now, I have already spoken in the division on wound treatment according to what was suitable for this book, and here I will speak of their treatment with the hand and with medicines according to the completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, I say that wounds are distinguished according to what causes the wound and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 Therefore, the things by which wounds are made are often like a thrown stone; or the cut of a sword, or a knife; or a blow with a spear, or wood, or an arrow; and similar things from many other objects.  />
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that are made according to the places of the body are as follows: a wound that falls on the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver; and similar things from those members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am describing the treatment of certain wounds, so that I may apply this reasoning and rule to other wounds as well.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I shall begin with simple head wounds, since the description of compounded wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore, I say:
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no bone fracture, consider whether it was caused by a thrown stone or something similar, which has only pierced the skin, resulting in a large wound. If you fear that an inflammation with hot aposteme may occur, hasten to perform an immediate phlebotomy of the cephalic vein. Do not delay this; extract from it blood according to its strength, especially if the blood coming out of the wound is scanty.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 And let the patient beware of becoming full, wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If something prevents bleeding, then let it be induced by food restriction, and do not approach meats or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And place on the wound, if an inflammation with hot aposteme occurs, cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with wine that has an astringent effect.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 But if you are secure from hot aposteme, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and the air has not yet changed it, the powder that I will describe shortly; but if the air has already changed it, then apply to it some ointments until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 But if the wound is large, or from a sword cut and similar things, and its lips do not come together by themselves, then join them with stitches, as I will describe in the chapter on abdominal wounds about their stitching.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If however the wound has already been separated from the bone and hangs down, and there is no support for it except a small tendon, then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then treat the wound with medicines and restore flesh in its place like skin. And instruct the patient to be nourished with foods that are thick, such as heads (of animals) and boiled wheat until it is like porridge; and similar foods.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 If you find decay in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut off all of the decayed part and throw it away; then treat (the wound).
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 But if in these wounds there is an artery or a vein from which blood flows, and it is not stopped by medicines, then look for a way to stop the bleeding.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If you find it (the vessel) uncut, then cut it with a scalpel or tie it off.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If necessity requires it when the previous method is not effective, then cauterize (the vessel) until the bleeding stops.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 But if these wounds are small and simple, then their treatment is easy and light; so that you should sprinkle this powder over them, because it heals them before the air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 The Method of Powder for Fleshing Out (Wounds).
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part of frankincense and two parts of dragon's blood and three parts of unslaked lime; grind all together very finely, and sift it. And fill the wound with it, and bind it well with a good bandage until it adheres to it well and clots with the blood. 》
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then bind (the wound) on top with lint and leave it, without loosening it until it has healed enough not to be opened again.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 For the medicine should not be removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes lime alone accomplishes this, when you do not have frankincense or dragon's blood at hand; and dragon's blood also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is placed on them and they are bandaged, and the wounds are fresh with their own blood, which has not been altered by the air. 》 》 》 》
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 If, however, the air has altered it by some alteration, especially in summer, then the intention is not to use this powder. Care for it with what we have said, placing on it certain digestive ointments; or place on it pastes made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until pus is emitted.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then care for the rest of the treatment until they heal.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 But if a fracture occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with tweezers; and I will now say the treatment for fractures of the skull as follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 Concerning wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter 85
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If, however, a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple wound of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If, however, the nerve of the neck or artery has been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no treatment for it except to avoid treating it with what causes strong astringency, such as alum and colocynth, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Because they harm nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not place anything cold at all on the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold, and their continuity is with the brain, which is the highest of the members: and let that by which it is treated be from medicines that are gentle, such as calx washed with sweet water, repeatedly infused with oil or rose oil and tuthia, when also washed with sweet water; and other mineral stones according to this method, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If, however, the wound is large, then apply a suture: or bind its lips with bandages.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 But if the wound has depth, or a cavity occurs at its lower part, where pus already collects, then pierce it in a more depressed place therein.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If the artery has already been cut in the wound and blood flow is occurring, then separate or cut it and tie it off; or cauterize it if necessity requires that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If the cartilage of the throat has been cut, or all of it, and the alhaudegi have been saved: then join the lips of the skin with stitches on top of the throat canal, and do not touch the throat, but equalize it, and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then tie it tightly in a decent manner, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments that have astringency and drying properties, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then explore it: if there are bone fragments in it, extract all of them, or as many as you can; and what cannot be prepared, leave it until the wound becomes foul, and its opening is separated and relieved.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 But if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder that I have mentioned.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 But if bone is seen in the wound and a fistula forms: then treat it with what was mentioned in its appropriate chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 About a wound on the ribs.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a blow from a spear or knife: and you see its depth, then consider [it].
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If therefore from the wound there comes out a hissing sound when the patient pants, then know that the wound is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 But if the wound is not deep and it is fresh with its blood: then do not apply powder on it from the first hour, nor tie it up, so that the blood does not become trapped in its depth and return to the heart and kill the patient; but apply an attracting ointment on it, and loosen it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If indeed the ointment is not available to you, then place an old cloth over the wound's opening so that it absorbs what comes out of it from moistures: and arrange for the patient to sleep on the wound, so that what accumulates within it may drain away.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If indeed three days or more have passed for the wound and no spasm has occurred to the patient, nor any bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see that its other conditions are good; then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Care for him with bandages and the rest of the treatment until he heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If indeed its healing is delayed and it remains open, then know that a fistula has already formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Care for it according to the chapter on fistulas.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut and is simple on the surface of the chest or back; then care for it with what preceded about stitching if it is large; or with dust if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 But if it has already made an impression on the bone and fragments have come out of it; then explore the wound and hasten to extract those fragments if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 But if they are not separate, then leave them until the wound becomes foul, for their extraction will be easier.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 For other wounds occurring in other members, the judgment in treatment is the same as we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 ¶ On wounds of the belly and the protrusion of the bowels, and their protrusions. ¶
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 A disruption that occurs in the belly is either large, medium, or small. ¶ ‌
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 From a large disruption, sometimes the bowel or several bowels come out.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Therefore their reinsertion and stitching is more vigorous and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 And even a small rupture is difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore, their reduction will be more difficult if you do not hurry to insert them into their place immediately; because it swells up, opens, and thickens, making its entrance difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore, the medium rupture is better than others; because with it, there is no difficulty in reducing the intestine, as happens with these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 Know that the suture of a vein is according to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two common sutures are suitable for the suture of the abdomen and for the suture of other wounds of the body, and two other sutures are specifically used for other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, they are more particularly associated with the suture of the abdomen; and I will describe each one to you with its explanation and demonstration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 I say therefore that when the wound is small and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is due to one of two causes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we have said; or because there is distension in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 Therefore, when this is the case, you should heat it so that you dip a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or boil in water aniseed, cumin, and pepper; crush them together with it until the distension is relieved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes this [reduces the inflammation] with wine that has astringent properties, and it is better than water alone for relieving distension.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 Therefore, when you see that the distension has been relieved, then wet the intestine with water in which mallow or marshmallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 Because through this its entrance with a small instrument is facilitated.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If its return is prevented after this treatment, then find a small fissure with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 The first cure is better when it is prepared than when it is cut; and there is no need to cut after the necessity and failure of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp; and let its tip not be too fine, but rather a bit blunter. And it should resemble a gimlet, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its own natural shape in its proper place, if possible over it; because this is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 But when the fissure is large in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back and raise his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly, if there is a fissure in one of the two parts of the belly, then direct your attention and thought always to this: that the part with the wound be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And thus it is necessary that you use it for large wounds and medium-sized wounds.  />  In addition to these things that I have mentioned above, it is also necessary to add certain things and preparations for this procedure.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 But in small wounds, place it according to how you prepare it.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make sure there is a devout assistant present with you, who holds the entire fissure in his hand: and bring its lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then have the one following remove something after something from it for stitching; and this is the method of common single-stitch suturing.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is as if you take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then leave from the end of the disruption a quantity equal to the width of the ring finger, that is, the physician's little finger; and insert one needle beyond that, with which you will introduce into it a thread at both ends of the skin, along with two ends of sifac which is under the skin from within, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and then you have already joined together two ends of the skin and two ends of sifac; and they become four layers.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then tie the thread double around the needle several times from both sides together until the two lips of the wound are joined by an acceptable approximation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then also leave the thickness of a finger and insert another needle; afterward, draw it with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Therefore, do not cease to do this with those needles until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 And the needles should be of medium thickness, neither too thin nor too thick; because thin needles cut the flesh very quickly, and thick ones are difficult to enter into the skin; therefore, it is necessary that they be of medium thickness between thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 And it is not appropriate that the needle be inserted at two points on the skin that are very close to each other, so that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound is not opened before its own healing, and also so that they do not become too long with suturing, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient in their sleep; and place little woolen balls around them from all sides, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound has already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And this type of stitch with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Because one needle, or two, or about that number is sufficient for their stitching.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second suture is common, so you can bring together with one suture the ends of four things: two ends of skin and two ends of flesh, as if they were one, using an equal needle with thread wound around it in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then, when you have penetrated these four ends with the needle, bring the needle back from where you started, so that the thread falls on the superior part of the wound: so that it is a suture like the suture of cloths by which clothes are sewn together. And put between every suture a quantity equal to the thickness of a little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 This suture is known by people.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this suture I healed a wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the separation of the wound was more than one palm: and about two palms came out from the middle of the intestine, and the separation was in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 I returned it therefore after his intestine stood outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 The wound was healed after about fifteen days: and I cured him, and he was saved: and he lived after that for many years, restored to his usual condition.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the physicians had judged that he would not be cured.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And it was a miracle that I did not cure it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor any other medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 So I put an old cloth over the wound twice a day, and I kept washing it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 But I will mention two specific kinds of suture according to the account.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it is as follows: begin with a sharp suture, and insert the needle from the outside towards the inside part.  ()
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the needle pierces the skin and travels along the length and width of the entire body: let the end fall on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate from one end to the other, from the inside out at the opposite end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 So when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in this manner in the same end from the outside to the inside: and let the other end fall away, which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the opposite end from the inside out: and with your penetration by which you make it penetrate into the end of the thread, which is in its part, until it penetrates entirely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then also begin from this same side, either the thread alone or with its end that is from the thread on the other side, and extract the needle from the skin which it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then return it to that skin with either the end of the thread which is on the other side along with this end of the thread; and extract it from the skin which is on that side; and do this once and another, and do this alternately, until you have entirely removed all outward according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 And the sum of this stitching is that as you sew the hides which are skins; so you should have thread one time from one side of the skin: and leave it another time from the other side, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second kind of stitching which is called Galenus.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This is his explanation as to how it should be done similarly, as some healers do, so that they gather all the parts to their corresponding fit by nature: and they apply the end of the thread to its other end, and the end of the thread to its other end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And that happens as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 You should insert the needle at the end of the eye nearest to you on the outside and make it penetrate only to the inside; and leave two ends loose.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then turn the needle around and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside at the two loose ends, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both around and make them penetrate from the inside out to the two ends of the other eye, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of stitching is better than the common easy stitch, and it is the stitch whose mention preceded.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 This then is also the teaching of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The stitching of the belly is done with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 That is, you introduce one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle from what is on your side, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the stitching of those who sew skins equally. '>
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly: then its stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment concerning the treatment of a wound is the same as with other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 That is to say, if you obtain a fresh wound with its own blood before the air changes it; and you return the intestines and sew them back in place, and stitch them up: then put powdered flesh-eating powder on top.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 But if the air has already changed the wound, then put some ointments on top of it which are present to you, until they make pus: and the stitches fall out, and the suture and eyelet heal.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 If the medications are not available to you, then immediately place on it an old cloth, from whence it begins to emit pus; and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not need other medications in many situations when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 But if you fear that the wound will infect the main limbs, then it is necessary that you soak a soft cloth in oil of moderate warmth or rose oil; and place it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 But if he feels pain or punctures or decay in his intestines (for this often happens), then give him an enema with black, warm wine of the stiptic kind; especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and has become penetrating up to its cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that what comes from the large intestine is of easier healing; and what comes from the small intestine is of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 But the intestine that is called the jejunum does not receive healing at all from a wound that occurs in it; and this is because of the multitude of its veins and their great size, and because of the subtlety of its body and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 But if what proceeds from the wound is an ulcer and you get it freshly: bring it back according to your method of bringing back the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 But if the time has passed and it has become green or black; then you should bind it with a thread over the place that has turned black from it, so that bleeding does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For an ulcer contains veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside: so that its attraction towards you is relieved, and its extraction in case of a zirb, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 ¶ Remembering an injury to the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When a disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible to restore it in some people; for this reason, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old, and a fistula formed, and discharge and flatulence came out from it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 Therefore, I applied treatment until I was not confident about his healing; nor did I cease to probe him until he was healed, and the place became solid.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I saw the place already solidified, I feared for the patient that something bad might happen to his belly; and nothing bad happened to him from this. ¶
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in his best condition, eating and drinking, and having sex, and entering the bath, and exercising according to his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And now some experimentalists say that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied up in this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And it is as if you take ants with big heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then gather the two lips of the wound together and place one of those ants that has its mouth open onto the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 Therefore when it bites on them and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it sticks and does not come undone.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with ants one after another according to the size of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then return it and its wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 Those heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is fed and healed, so that no further harm comes to the patient.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And now it is possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread: after removing it from the animal's intestine, it is attached together with it when inserted into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And it is necessary to take the end of this thread from the intestine and remove much of the meat from it.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a fine linen thread around its end, wrapped around it.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert that thread into the needle, along with the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then return it to the opening.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 And this method of stitching with ants and intestine is only according to the path of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that if the wound is large and especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no cure for it except to trim it down, and its healing is not possible at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 ¶ On the care of hernias and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that any wound or abscess, when it becomes old and chronic, turns into an ulcer and does not heal, and always discharges pus and does not drain: then it is universally called a fistula in whatever limb it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And indeed a fistula is truly a hardened, white, perforated knot: it does not cause pain, and has the shape of a bird's feather. And because of this, some call it Risati, which means "feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And there are certain hours in which it becomes moist and discharges pus. 
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And perhaps the moisture splits at certain times. 》
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And sometimes this moisture is great and is little; and it is thick, and it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already stated in the division, then when I said "wounds," that every wound which does not heal and flesh is not born in it, this is only due to one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 One of which is either due to the lack of blood in the body or its bad quality; or because between it and its surface there is hard flesh preventing the birth of flesh; or because there is much dirt and filth; or because the wound itself is putrid, and the matter sent to it is of poor quality; or because the medicine used for its treatment is unsuitable; or because the corruption falling in the region is a type of plague, or by the nature of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of diseases is difficult and the healing of apostemes is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone in it, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the division; and it is necessary here for me to make you know the treatment of fistulas and abscesses, which are done by the way of surgery with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Know therefore that a fistula can occur in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For among them are fistulas which reach great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the bladder; or the intestine, or the bladder, or one of the ribs; or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints composed of bones, as in the hand and foot; and among them are those which go towards the proximity of the principal member and its like.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 Therefore, of these fistulas, the one which is in this manner, is difficult to heal from diseases and does not accept treatment, and dealing with it is hard work and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If the fistula is such that its depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and you wish to come to know it, then take a probe of iron or copper, if the fistula extends in a straight line, and search for it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 If there is a twist in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Because lead, due to its softness, is bent around the twist.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the fistula has multiple openings, it will not be possible for you to indicate on it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Therefore, irrigate one of its openings from among its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 For the liquid with which you irrigate it goes towards the other openings and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then carefully investigate in whichever way it is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is an opening or a nerve, and the concavity of the fistula is distant or close by; or whether the fistula is one which has many openings, and stand over the whole thing with all your strength, and with your questioning where you question the patient, and the discovery of pain upon pressing with your hand on the place, and similar signs and accidental causes of inflammation. )))
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when you stand over all these things with true station, then go to the cure according to your confidence, and it is that you consider then, if the fistula is close by and apparent, or in a safe place distant from the joint, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then cut the fistula as has been said in my account, and remove what is in it from the filtration, and decayed flesh, which grows in its opening from flesh or pus, and similar things; and care for it until it heals. )))
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If however the fistula is of deep length and straight: then you ought to cut it as deeply as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then apply linens wrapped in sharp medicines, and insert them into the concavity of the fistula which you have grasped with iron; do this several times until the sharp medicine has corroded all that remains in the concavity of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 If however it does not heal by this means, then cauterize it as we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 Therefore if the cause of the fistula is a bone, and you are certain of it, then search for it, and cut it as I have told you, unless something prevents you from a vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 Therefore if the bone is revealed to you and there is something corrupted and blackened upon it, then scrape it until its entire corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with that which causes it to grow flesh, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 But if it does not heal and discharges pus as before, then know that you have not reached the complete removal of corruption. 
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Therefore clean it a second time, and make an exacting search for its root and cleansing with all your strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If however it heals, that is good; and if not, then know that the corruption is in a deep part of the body which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 Therefore you have no skill regarding it except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 But if the bone is small and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps that are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If, however, there are many bones, then carefully draw all of them out, and do not leave any with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 But if something from the moist parts causes a contrariety and there is no fear or error in their incision, then cut those moist parts and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then place on the wound something that will cause it to putrefy, and leave it until what is around those bones from flesh and moist parts has putrefied.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And guard the wound so that it does not heal over.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And let the incision you made in your work be drawn together.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Or place on it, if you wish, a cotton cloth soaked in pounded sulfur with oil, or a cotton cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any of the green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those moist parts have putrefied and the bones are separated from them, their removal and drawing out is easier.  />
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 But if it is a large bone, such as the thigh bone or hip bone, and the like, and what has become corrupt in it is a large part; then scrape it with the finest scraper until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 But if what has become corrupt in it is a large part and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw through it and cut all the way to where the corruption has reached; then care for it until it heals over.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you of a case that happened to a man in his leg; so that you might place it as an example and aid upon your work.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 There was a young man about thirty years old who had pain in his leg from an internal cause that moved within him, until the matter reached the leg and formed a large abscess; there was no external cause for this.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 Therefore, time was extended with that error of the physicians until the abscess burst, and many substances gathered with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 And his treatment was delayed until the leg ulcerated, and many openings formed on it, which all discharged pus and body fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of surgery among them until I was called, and I saw his leg and the substances flowing from those openings in great quantity. Indeed, the man's entire body had already wasted away, and his color was jaundiced.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I examined all the openings and found that they connected to each other from every part of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I hurried and cut above one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone, and found it corrupt, already rotten and blackened, and putrefied, to the point that it had been penetrated all the way to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 I sawed off what was exposed to me and prepared from the rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I concluded that there was no corruption in the bone except what I cut off and sawed away.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And I had already rooted it out.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed a dressing on the wound with healing and strengthening medicines for a long time. ()}
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it did not heal.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried again and exposed above the bone beyond my first exposure; and I found a continuous corruption connected to the bone, and I sawed away what appeared to me from that corruption as well.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 Then I attempted to heal it. ()}
Et non est restauratum.	 And it was not healed.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 Therefore, I exposed it again and did not stop cutting the bone bit by bit and attempting to heal it until I had cut off about a hand's breadth from the bone along with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I restored him with medicines, and it quickly healed and was cured; nor would this repetition of the operation and cutting have been necessary for him, except because of his weakened condition and his limited ability to endure, and my fear of death for him; because from the excess of evacuation, he suffered bad fainting spells every hour.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 Therefore, he was healed completely; and in place of the bone, firm and good flesh grew, and his body was well-arranged, and his strength returned; and he recovered his usual condition; and the operation did not cause him any harm at all while walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 But if the bone protrudes in place of a broken body part, then it is necessary to saw it off in this manner: Take a ligature and tie it tightly at the end of the protruding bone; and order someone to pull it upwards; and place another thicker ligature made of wool above the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then tie it tightly over the flesh that is on the bone; and extend its end so as to pull the flesh downwards; and thus you expose the flesh in the place where you want to saw, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Put a piece of wood or board under the bone properly; because when you do this, it does not prevent the saw from cutting through the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 And it is necessary for the sawing to be done briefly over the corrupted place, so that there may not be a corruption in the hollow of the bone; and so that it does not appear to the sense of sight when revealed, but rather compels another part to be sawn instead.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 But if the bone is corrupted and does not protrude, but rather remains continuous with another part; and the corruption is in the middle of it or in any part of it; then remove all the flesh from every side.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Then saw that part where the corruption is, until the sawing reaches the other side; and let the sawing be along the length of the corruption by a little, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 And if the corruption is at a joint, cut off the corrupted joint and saw the bone where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 But if the corruption is between two joints, then there is no skill [needed] but to scrape it off.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If the corruption is in the comb of the hand or the comb of the foot, then the situation there is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 Indeed, you should examine how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And scrape it off, and clean it in whatever way you can and with whatever skill seems right to you, when a vein or nerve does not hinder you.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that there are many types of instruments and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness or thinness, their size or smallness, their hardness or softness.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you prepare an instrument suitable for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations indicate to you the type of instrument you need when your work is extensive.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a witness to the methods of diseases, for then you will find by yourself what suits each one from among the instruments for every illness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I will confirm to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you should place for examples on which you cut, and the trial by which you test others.
Forma Serrae.	 Shape of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Shape of a third saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This is the depicted shape of the saw; let it be made neatly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Let its arch be above, its sharpness from iron, and its handle from boxwood, and let it be made neatly in a pyramidal shape.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 The shape of the razor for cutting tendons.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 Let the head of this razor be in the shape of a star-shaped nail head, and its points be in the shape of the points of the elischetefeg.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 And it is not suitable except to scrape with it the heads of tendons when they are damaged or have a large and wide opening.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 The shape of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 The shape of the medium-sized razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 The shape of the wide razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 The shape of the razor with a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 The shape of another fine razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 The shape of another curved-tipped razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 The shape of a small and delicate probe.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 The shape of the razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Also, the shape of the large razor. xspace
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 This resembles a file and its tip is like a saw; it is used in many places because of the roughness of the bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 The shape of the razor suitable for scraping that which has been perforated from the bone.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its tip is triangular, with sharp points.
Fit ex Indi.	 It comes from India. xspace
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly, it is necessary that all of the things which we have mentioned be made from razors and chisels and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 ¶ On cutting off extremities and sawing bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter Eighty-Nine
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 Extremities become putrid either from an external cause or from an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 When you have treated that corruption with medicinal treatment and the treatment does not help, and you see the corruption spreading in the extremity where nothing heals it, then you must cut off that limb until the point of corruption, so that the sick person may escape from death or from a greater evil due to the loss of the limb.  />
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign of which this occurs is that the member turns black until it seems rotten; that fire has burned it, or that it becomes rotten after turning black; until that rot extends to the next member and spreads throughout the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Hurry therefore with its incision, and likewise if the cause of the rotting is from the bite of certain venomous creatures, such as a sea scorpion, a viper, a toad, and similar things.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If therefore the rotting or bite is at the tip of a finger, then cut the finger and do not leave space for the rotting to advance up to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And likewise if it occurs on the hand, then cut it from the root of the finger, and do not leave space for the rotting until it reaches into the flesh of the arm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it invades there, then cut the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 But if the rotting passes through and you see it around the elbow, then death is certain for the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And to administer something beyond that from the treatment is a measure of skill.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And do the same for the foot when rotting invades a toe; then cut it at one of the joints. And if it reaches to the sole of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 But if it goes up to the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 If rotting has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it except to release and leave the patient to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the method of cutting a member or sawing it is to tie a ligature below where you wish to cut, and tie another ligature above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And one assistant should pull the lower ligature downward, and another assistant should pull the upper ligature upward.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures with a broad spatula until all of the flesh is revealed. 
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it should be cut or cauterized.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And it is necessary that you place a linen cloth from all parts and that the saw does not touch the healthy place: and an additional injury may occur to the patient, as well as a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 But if bleeding occurs inside while you are working, then quickly cauterize the place or put on it some powders that absorb blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and take care of it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you that this same thing happened to a man on his foot, just as I am telling you now.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 Which means that blackness occurred on his foot with a burn that resembles the burning of fire: and this corruption first appeared on his toe until it began to affect the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 Therefore, the man hastened to remove it himself after he saw the corruption attacking his limb with great intensity, as he found from the pain and burn: and he cut into himself at the joint, and was cured.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long time had passed, that same corruption occurred on his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 Therefore he came to me, and I tried to remove that excess with what I placed on his hand from medicines after cleaning his body: but the excess did not go away, and it began to advance into another finger until corruption began in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 So he called on me to cut open his hand: and I did not want to do that, hoping that through my means the excess would be removed: and I also feared that cutting into his hand could cause death.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Because the strength of the man was against this situation.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 After he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and word came to me about him that he had hastened and cut open his whole hand: and he was cured. 》
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And I have not brought forth this account except to serve as an aid regarding that which falls under the category of this disease; and so that there may be a signification by which it is indicated, and according to which action should be taken.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 About the care of veins and the quality of enema with medicines.
Caput XC.	 Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy limbs and the abscess extends to the point of forming a collection of pus: then it bursts or is perforated, and what is inside it, namely pus, comes out; and there remains a space empty as if it were a vessel; and the skin over it is like a thin cloth that has not yet reached the final stage of decay, neither does it press upon an opening, nor upon a nerve, nor upon a ligament: then it deserves to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula. However, if its space extends to the point where corruption presses upon any one of these parts, then it is called a Fistula or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And its treatment is that you should cut all that skin as if it were rolled back; and especially when it has become thin like a cloth; and trusting that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 But if you hope that the skin will adhere and that the final corruption will not follow; and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an enema: and it should be treated as if it were a Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it is large and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor, then enema it with an Egyptian medicine made of vinegar, oil, and gum acacia, the parts being equal, collected in a vessel; and they are cooked over fire until the medicine becomes red; and it reaches the consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take from it what you need, and dissolve it with water and honey, and administer it as an enema to the bladder. Close its opening and leave the medicine inside for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then extract it with pressing. Do this for so many days until the bladder is cleansed and the odor removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And sometimes it should be administered as an enema with water of ash, when this medicine is not available to you. Take the ash from grapevine wood or ash from holm oak wood and throw it into the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then filter it and administer it as an enema until you are confident that the bladder has been cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then administer it as an enema with water and honey to which some ground cinnamon has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or administer it as an enema with mixed honey and wine, because it is the nature of honey to cleanse and wash, and wine makes the bladder adhere, especially when there is a preponderance of dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 When you do this several times and are confident that the bladder's corruption has been removed, then administer it as an enema with something that promotes the growth of flesh within it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And this is done by taking diaphoretic plaster and dissolving it with rose oil and astringent wine, or by administering it as an enema with certain other medicines and ointments whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 If the opening of the bladder is too narrow for an enema to pass through, then slightly widen it with iron: or place a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment or in basil ointment within it until it widens.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly, if the opening is also large, then sew together its lips with a stitch: and leave from it the amount into which an enema can enter without anything added.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly, if the opening from which the pus runs is raised upwards, then cut into it in a lower place that is within it, so that the pus may run out downwards; for when the pus is constricted in the depth of the Sinus, it prevents the growth of flesh in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 And if it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus lower down as you wish, then try to prepare the member with a preparation that will cause the pus to run out easily according to how it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try that nothing at all of the pus is retained in it; and take consolidative medicines which are placed on the mark, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 And spread them out onto a piece of linen.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the piece of linen be large enough to cover the entire Sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then cut with scissors a hole directly into the opening of the Sinus, slightly larger than the opening of the Sinus itself.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then spread a soft ointment onto another piece of linen according to the size of the hole; and place it over the opening, positioned far from the Sinus opening, so that the exit of the pus may be relieved; and do not remove the large cloth until after some days, once a day.  />
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 But the one that is over the opening of the Sinus, that is the one you remove in every hour, so that what collects in it from the pus may go out; and so that you may know if that which runs out of it is much or little, or well digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And with this again consider the place of the Sinus itself, whether its owner feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, and whether there is a swelling in it, or there is no swelling in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 When your treatment is thus extended and you see the material coming out of the sinus opening, then know that the sinus has already attached or is approaching attachment; therefore, in the morning or on the third day, loosen it. And when you open the wound, change to another cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 But if after a long time a fine pus comes out of the sinus, do not despair of its attachment, for its healing is approaching; for there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and others act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 But if after many days undigested pus comes out of the sinus, then know that the sinus is not attached.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If the attachment of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then in the treatment of the wound, let the medicines be made so that they are humid in substance but dry in power; such as the ointment dyafinicon, when to it is added an excess of zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And one of the most effective treatments is to take the ointment dyafinicon and dissolve it in rose oil, and sprinkle over it an equal amount of old wine by substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then mix it together and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 Similarly, perform this action when you do not have the ointment dyafinicon present; instead use honey, cooked until it thickens, and use that.  />
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense; grind all of it together, and sprinkle the powder over honey while it is on the fire.  />  />  />  />
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then place it on a cloth and bind it over the sinus; and when you have cooked the honey until it thickens, sprinkle over it spices and place another cloth over it, and bind that.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes it is administered with long Aristolochia, and the root of heavenly lily, which is a lily; and herb flour, and Centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them either as simples or in compound form; grind them and sieve the powder. Sprinkle it on the honey I mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 But if the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it; either it has already made an impression on the bones or on other hard parts of the body or ligaments. Then treat it with the treatment for fistulas as was stated before.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 ¶ On the care of paronychia and broken nails, and on cutting into a finger and dissection.
Caput XCI.	 Chapter XCI
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Paronychia is an abscess that occurs under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot; and perhaps it may occur on the other fingers as well.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 When its duration is prolonged and the care of it neglected, it becomes an abscess with hot pus; or it corrupts and emits pus until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts it all, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone until there is a foul odor. The tip of the finger becomes swollen and its color darkens. ︎
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 Therefore, when you treat it with what we have said in the section on division, and your treatment does not help, then you must cut off with a knife all the remaining overgrowth from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 For indeed, cautery is very beneficial.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 But if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy, and the overgrowths of the nail now press into the flesh on the inside and begin to prick it and injure it, then you must place a thin wire under the corner of the nail that pricks the flesh and push it up; and cut through the flesh with ease and apply to it what remains of medicines from burning, corrosive ones until all of it is removed. ︎
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If the rottenness has already taken hold of the wound, then it is necessary that you cut out the wound and remove it; for it will never heal while a putrefied part remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 But if you see the ulcer and rottenness progressing into a finger, then cut it at one of its joints, as was mentioned earlier.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 But if the nail is injured by scraping or blows, and it causes intense pain, then you should first bleed the patient.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut the nail with a sharp pointed spoon, making an incision from top to bottom as far as you can see.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And be careful that the incision does not reach the flesh underneath the nail, for you will cause intense pain to the patient, and it will become a cause of unnecessary growth of flesh in the place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then care for the place with something that soothes pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 But an additional finger that is born in the hands of some people is sometimes entirely fleshy; and sometimes there are bones in them, and sometimes there is a nail; and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its growth is at certain joints of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 Therefore, that which is born at certain joints of the finger does not move; and that which is born at the root of the joint perhaps moves.  \\
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 Therefore, for those of them that are fleshy, its incision is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 That is, you should cut it at its root with a broad spoon.  />
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 But for those whose growth is at the root of the joint, its treatment is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore, refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 But for those born at the very tip of the finger, you should first cut its flesh with a round incision until it reaches bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him until he is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 The union that occurs between fingers can often happen either from birth, that is, it is born with it, or from the healing of a wound, or from a burn by fire and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, one should separate that union until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then put between them linens or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly heal together, and separate them; or put between them a thin lead sheet until the place heals as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly, if the union occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that union according to how it is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 ¶ About the Incision of a Fistula
Caput XCII.	 Chapter 92
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 A fistula is a twisted vein, swollen and full of black bile that occurs in many parts of the body; most commonly it happens in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and workers who carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore, you should administer a strong purgative to expel black bile from the body several times.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then perform phlebotomy on the patient, drawing blood from the basilic vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 Their treatment with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One of them is that they should be cut and the black blood drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And the other method is that the vein should be raised and removed entirely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 Its cutting is done in this manner:
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 First, bathe the leg with very warm water until the thick and foul blood is loosened. 》
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then bind the patient's leg from its upper part near the hip to below the knee with a bandage. 》 》 》 》 》
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three with a broad incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then elevate, that is, draw blood from the lower part of the leg upwards with the hand, and the phlebotomist should first bleed the patient.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut the nail along with it downwards until an amount of blood comes out that you see is sufficient and which the strength of the patient can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Then tie it off and advise him to abstain from foods that produce black bile, and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins fill up and cause harm to the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 Its elevation is according to this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Scrape the leg of the patient if it has many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then place him in a bath or wrap his leg with hot water until it becomes red and the veins swell up, or have him exercise strongly if there is no bath available until the limb becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then cut the skin along the course of the vein lengthwise or at its lower end near the knee or at the lower part of it near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with hooks and strip the vein from all sides until it becomes visible to the touch, and at its appearance you will see it reddish towards black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When it emerges from the skin, you will see it white as if it were a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert under it a probe until when it is elevated and comes out of the skin; hang it with a blunt hook gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then cut another incision near that incision by three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it becomes visible.  />
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then elevate it with probes as you did before, and hang it with another hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then cut another section, or multiple sections if you need it.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then lift and cut the last section at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then draw it out to the section above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this until you have drawn it out of the upper or all sections; when it has completely emerged, then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 But if it does not obey you in being drawn out and lifted, then insert a needle with a double thread, tie it off, and draw it out; or insert a probe beneath it, and turn your hand to every part until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And be careful that it is not cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, it will be very difficult for you to lift it up, and harm will come to the patient from this.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when you have drawn it all out, then place on the wound a wool cloth soaked in wine and rose oil or oil; and care for him until he is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 But if the grape is twisted and has a tortuous course with turns and is not as we said straight, then you should make incisions over it at every point of its tortuosity and at the places of its turns.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then suspend it with hooks until you have lifted it all up; and be careful in your section over it not to cut a vein or cause injury, for it will become difficult for you to lift up or draw out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Therefore, keep your caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The form of the incident which heals the grape.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The form of the blind knot.  ?>
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It does not have a curve like the other knots, nor is it sharp at the tip so as not to injure a vein; and it has a thick tortuosity, gentle, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein with its fineness; indeed, let there be an excess thickness in it, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 "On the Extraction of a Vein from the Leg.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Alizegi and Arab lands, and in dry, hot lands where few tender plants grow, that is, where neither grass nor tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 Its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, just as happens with internal worms and roundworms, and the worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And the sign of the beginning of this vein's formation is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then the area becomes blistered.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then the vein begins to emerge from that blistered place, like a root of a plant or an animal.  \\
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 Therefore, when its end appears, then you should wrap a piece of lead over it, weighing from one drachm keil to two drachms and a nida (unit of weight), and let the suspended lead hang down from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Whenever something comes out of it to the exterior, wrap that in lead and bind it.  •
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 But if it is greatly elongated, then cut off a part of it and wrap up the rest.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut it at its root until it has all come out.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 For if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh; and causes an abscess and rotting in that place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore, it is necessary that it be gently handled and extracted little by little, until it has come out from its end, and nothing of it remains in the body; and from this vein comes out in some people what is in its length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has happened to me, because a man has left with twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 But if it should happen to you during your treatment: then insert a probe into its opening and perforate it through with a long opening, along with the body, until all that is in it from matter is expelled; and apply putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then treat him according to the method for apostemes (abscesses).
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle or on the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and from each opening a branch emerges.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore treat it as we said in the division, and with what was mentioned before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 ¶ About cutting for worms generated under the skin, which is called "bouina" (ox-disease).
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This disease is called in a certain land among us "ox-disease," because it often happens to oxen; and there is one small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 And it travels throughout the whole body, ascending and descending; and it becomes evident to the senses during its movement from member to member, until it breaks out somewhere on the skin and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 Just as there are also worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms, in the intestines.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And it should be feared because of its harmful nature.  /> It is a very serious disease.  /> When someone is afflicted with this disease, he must be treated according to the following method.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it travels through the body and is lifted up to the head and reaches that place, then perhaps it opens there and emerges and destroys the eye; and this happens very often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 Therefore when you want to cure him and extract it, then this cannot be done except during its movement and appearance to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 Therefore, you should tie what is above him and what is below him with a strong ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above him and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If he sinks into the flesh and you do not find him, then place a cautery with fire on that spot until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And what is to be feared most is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 But if you see that he has already reached the head near the eye, then tie a good ligature above him on the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above him and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 And the sick person should use cleansing of his body with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And let him beware of foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 On the incision for the disease called Nakir.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter 95
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This disease is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in certain members; then it changes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And indeed I myself have already seen this, as I narrate to you. >
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And she exposed her arm, and I saw a small swelling on the vein of the forearm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after I stayed there for one hour, I saw a swelling advance with heat, as if advancing like a worm, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than is possible; it was like living silver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 Therefore the pain withdrew from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then I stayed there for one hour, and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm. >
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then she told me that it would turn around in her whole body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 I have observed the speed of its transition from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed before that, I had not seen this disease in my eyes as such.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 However, I have seen many who find the pain changing from limb to limb; and I did not see it myself as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that this is the case except because she was one of those who are from dry bodies with detectable veins; hence it appears to the senses that this wind has changed.  />  Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quia mulier erat ex illis qui sunt de uillis corporum sicci detegitarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui ea uentositas permutata.  />  And I do not think that this is the case except because she was one of those who are from dry bodies with detectable veins; hence it appears to the senses that this wind has changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delicate and of moist bodies with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 Therefore, when you wish to cure it and the patient feels that pain, then if it is visible to your eye as we have said, quickly string above it and below it; and cut above it until that wind, constricted, comes out; and cauterize the place.  />
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If however you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with purging the body, and with that which expels winds, and drive them out with foul-smelling pills, and with pills of celery, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 ¶ On the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows are distinguished according to their kinds and according to the places into which they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 Their variety is such that among them are those which have large points and small ones; and hollow ones and blunt ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And among these are those which have three corners.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And among them there are tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And among them there are stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 But those which fall according to the members are of two kinds.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 Or the members are from the main hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestine, bladder, and similar things.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Therefore, when a missile falls into any of these members and the signs of death, which I will tell you about afterwards, appear to you, then it is necessary for you to extract that missile from them, because death follows him in whom it is, in many cases.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the missile is not hidden deep in the member, then extract it and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 For the signs of the brain when a missile falls into it and penetrates the nose and exits through the fontanel that is above the brain are: because severe convulsions, blindness, vertigo, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile occur.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And sometimes blood comes out of the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And sometimes speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And from the place of the wound comes out a white liquid like gruel.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And from it comes something like the moisture of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treating it, and extract the missile if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of a missile when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left nipple; and he feels with it as if it were fixed in something hard, not in something hollow. 》
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to that of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And it is followed by coldness in the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Know therefore that death has certainly descended.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is that frothy blood flows from the wound, and the vessels following the neck become inflamed, and the color of the patient changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And he exhales a large, deep breath, and seeks cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls into the diaphragm, which is in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great panting with severe pain and sighing, and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out of the wound with the food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 And if the arrow falls into the belly and is fixed there, then something of feces comes out of the wound, or a little piece of gut or an already torn intestine.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 There is therefore no hope for his cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 But if the arrow falls into the bladder and urine comes out, and something protrudes to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the patient, then know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The other members, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulders, arms, ribs of the back, clavicle, hip, leg, and similar from the limbs are cured in many ways, provided that the arrow does not find an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, so that you may know it for your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 Which is, that a certain man had an arrow fall into the lacrimal of his eye, at the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 I removed it from her on the other side, under the fat of her ear; and she was healed, and nothing happened to her eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I removed another arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained nothing from it except a small part of its end, to which its wood adhered; and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with a soft iron, in which there are no barbs.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 Therefore, the Jew was healed, and nothing evil happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I removed another arrow from a Christian's throat.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 And it was an Arabic arrow, and that one has barbs.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 Therefore, I cut above it between the two windpipes; and it was already sunk into his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 Therefore, I was careful with it until I removed it; and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I removed another arrow from a man who had it fall into his abdomen; and we thought that he would die from it.  ?>
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After thirty days had passed and nothing of his condition had changed, I cut above the arrow; and I split it open, and I removed it; and he was healed, and no evil befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound above it had healed over.  ?>
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the base of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 And I saw a woman into whose abdomen an arrow had fallen, and the wound above it had healed over, and the arrow remained inside her; and nothing of her condition changed, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 And I saw another man whose arrow fell into his face; and the wound healed, leaving a little pain, and many similar cases like these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's nobles, which had fallen into the middle of his nose and then turned slightly towards the right side; and the entire arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 Therefore I was called to treat him after the incident with the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 I found therefore that the wound of the arrow was very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 Therefore I examined it with a fine probe and did not feel it; but he himself found the puncture and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 Therefore I hoped that this was the puncture from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 Therefore I applied a plaster to the place with attracting and digestive power, hoping that the place would swell up and show me the sign of the arrow so that I could cut above it; and no incident occurred in the place indicating that the arrow had reached there.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 Therefore I continued with the plaster on him for many days; and no incident occurred, and the wound healed meanwhile; but he remained weak from its extraction for several days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me this.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 Therefore I placed an acute, corrosive medicine on this wound for many days until it opened up; and when I probed it with a probe, I felt the fine tip of the arrow attached to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added to the opening of the wound with this acute medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared to us visibly; and about four months passed with him.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then after the wound had increased and it was possible for me to introduce tweezers into it and move it, but it did not obey to come out; then I did not cease refining and contriving over it with various devices until one day I began on it with well-made tweezers, according to the form that will appear at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I repaired the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed doctors judge that the nasal cartilage cannot be restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 Therefore I repaired it [the nasal cartilage], and the wound became consolidated, and the patient was healed with complete health; nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows, so that you may take it as a rule and example for what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with narration, nor does the book comprehend it; and a wise craftsman compares little to much, and what is present to what is absent; and he finds a new operation and a new instrument for descending into foreign matters of this art when they occur.  (Here, "foreign" refers to things outside of the usual scope of the art.)
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 I say therefore that arrows do not come out of the members in which they are fixed except by two methods.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or by pulling from the place into which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or by the contrary action on the other part [of the arrow].
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which comes out from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place and is pulled out;
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 But if it does not come out at the time of its fall, then you must leave it for a few days until the flesh around it begins to putrefy; and its pulling out is relieved, and its removal becomes easier.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly, if it is fixed in bone and does not come out to you at the time of its fall, then leave it also for a few days; and tug on it with attraction and movement every day until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 But if it does not come out to you after the days, then you must pierce around the arrow in the very bone from every side with a fine drill until the arrowhead becomes enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then pull it out and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 But if an arrow is stuck in the bone of the head and has already penetrated one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those symptoms I mentioned appear on the patient: then refrain from pulling out the arrow and leave it there until its condition becomes balanced after several days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if an arrow reaches the sphenoid bone, then death is not delayed for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not lodged except in the body of the bone only and does not penetrate to the sphenoid, and the patient remains for several days and nothing of those symptoms occurs to him: then endeavor to pull out the arrow and extract it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 But if it is very firmly lodged and does not yield to your efforts at extraction: then apply treacle around the arrow, as I have told you; then treat the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 But if the arrow has already hidden itself within the body and is concealed and hidden from sensation: then seek it with a probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If you feel it, then pull it out with some instruments that are suitable for its extraction.  />
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you cannot reach it because of the constriction of the wound and because of the length of the arrow deep within: and there is no bone, or nerve, or vein there: then make an incision over it until the wound is enlarged and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 But if there are ears on which it is lodged, then free the flesh fixed in them from every side, by any means you can do that, and endeavor, if it cannot be extracted because of the fracture of the ears and their contortion, until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And you, when you administer the extraction of an arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand with pincers to all parts, until you make it come out: and be very careful not to break the arrow and make its attraction and extraction difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot remove it in one hour, then leave it for some days until what is around it putrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then reopen it; for the skin will be relieved. But if bleeding opposes you, then administer what we said in its treatment in its own chapter; and protect your virtue from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer the remedy in every way possible for avoidance of a dart; and let it be with ease, and calmness, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 And it is necessary that when you draw the dart, the patient should be weak according to the figure as it was in the case of the dart itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 But if the dart emerges from the opposite side of the other part, or if something already protrudes to the exterior; or if the tip of the dart causes a prominence by touch on the nearby upper skin surface, and you see it standing out: cut over it, and let the incision be according to the quantity that forceps can grasp in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then draw it; for it becomes easy for exiting.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 But if it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand according to the roundness, until the dart imprints on the bone and enlarges itself; then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: leave it for some days; then reopen it until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 But if the dart has a wooden shaft, then push it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 But if the wooden shaft has fallen off and you want to administer a push: then insert into it a hollow instrument, so that its concavity enters into the tail of the dart; then push it out with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If however the arrow is barbed, then push it through with an instrument that enters into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 For the arrow will be relieved by this.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut out all the flesh in which the poison is found; if you are able to do this.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then treat it with what is suitable for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 But if the arrow has fallen into the chest, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side; and it is close to what you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then, whether the wound, if you see [it], treat that until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are removed.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 Let the ends be similar to the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp over an arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And many forms are made from them, large and small and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and its narrowness, and the width of the wound and its tightness.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The form of a barbed pusher.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the form of a blunt pusher.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is the end of a blunt instrument like a radius, so that its entry into a barbed arrow may be relieved, and it may be pushed along with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The end of a barbed pusher is barbed like the feather of a bird, so that the entry of the arrow into it and its pushing may be relieved.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 ¶ On bleeding veins.
Caput XCVII.	 Chapter 97.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	 The veins that are customarily bled are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	 Of which sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins that are behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries that appear in the two temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "the observers"; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the tip of the nose.

Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	 One of them is called the Cephalic and it comes from the outer side; and the common people call it the vein of the head.
Et Fusca.	 And the Dark Vein.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	 And it is the Median vein, and it consists of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic; and the common people call it the body vein. ()));

¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	 ¶ Concerning bloodletting from the two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 Bloodletting from the two veins behind the ears is beneficial for old catarrhs, and migraine, and sahafat, and old sores of the head.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 And the method of venesection for this [condition] is as I describe.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 And the procedure is to shave the head of the patient; and to rub his occipital region, where the two veins are located, with a coarse cloth, using good friction.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then the patient should tighten his neck with a band, until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Therefore seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark that spot with caustic.  /> Et incide eam cum culello bene acuto, et sume tantum quantitatem quam tibi placet de sanguine eius.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 Then take the venesection knife, and it is called the cutting knife.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 Then insert [the knife] under the vein into the skin, until the venesection reaches the mouth of the vein.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin using a transverse incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	 And let the length of the incision be two finger-widths joined together, or about that; and allow as much blood to flow out as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	 Then bind it with small bandages, and leave it until it heals.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	 And now at the beginning of the book, the incision and cauterization of these [veins] have been discussed previously.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	 ¶ On venesection of the two temporal arteries.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	 Indeed, venesection of the two arteries that are in the temples is beneficial for chronic migraine, malignant headache, persistent eye strain, and acute discharge of humors to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the method of venesection for these [arteries] is as I tell you.  /> Radatur caput infirmi, et fricetur capitulum eius cum panno aspero frictionis bona.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 The patient should tighten his neck strongly, until the two veins become clearly visible and their pulse can be felt under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then indeed signs with wax.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 Then raise the skin above the vein towards the top with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, raising the vein upwards.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And cut it as you did with the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 Then release the constriction of the patient, and place your finger over the vein for one hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then place a bandage and wool over it, and bind it tightly on top; and leave it until it heals.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	 And now the description of them has preceded, and their cutting, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	 ¶ On venesection of the forehead vein after cephalic venesection.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	 The benefit of venesection of the forehead vein is after cephalic venesection for old facial diseases, and for migraine, and redness, and foul ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And its quality of venesection is as I tell you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 Let the patient constrict his neck with a band until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then take an instrument called a Fossorium. ︎
Cuius haec est forma.	 Whose shape is this:
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Place the prominent point that is at the end of the Fossorium over the vein, and strike it with a comb or another similar object; and let the blood flow according to your wish.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then release the constriction of the patient, and bind it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes it is opened with a wide lancet.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, it should not be a sharp-pointed lancet like the others; rather, it should have a broad point. ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And the lancet should incise it according to its course, because the opening is near; and perhaps in it a sharp lancet may break when it is thin.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 On bleeding from the two lacrimal veins.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 The remedy for the two veins that are in the two lacrimal sacs of the two eyes is for scabs and redness of the eye, and for a growth in the eye, and for diseases of the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 And the nature of bleeding from them is that the patient should bind their neck with a bandage.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Then bleed from them, and you should stand over his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 And let the bleeding be made across the width rather than the length, with a small lancet, somewhat wide, for there is no flesh in that place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 For if the lancet is too fine at the tip, it might break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 Then let as much blood run out as you need.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 And place cotton over them, and bind them for one night, and then unbind them. ︎
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 On bleeding from the veins of the nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 Bleeding from the veins of the nose is useful for acute fever and severe headache, and for diseases of the face, such as migraine and redness that appears on the face, especially when it is chronic.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 And the nature of this bleeding is that the patient should bind their neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold the patient's nose with your left hand, and take a fine, long lancet, and insert it into the middle of the nostril, between that which separates the nose straight. ︎ 
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 Because the vein cannot be felt there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And it is necessary that you move your hand with the lancet slightly and let as much blood run out as you need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then bind it for one night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 For it heals quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 On bleeding from the veins of the cheekbones.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 "Indeed, two of the uses of phlebotomy according to Abulcasis are for shortness of breath, leprosy, melancholic illnesses, impetigo and malignant ulcers, and corrosives, that is, herpes simplex.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 "And the manner of these bloodlettings is that the patient is tied under both ears on their neck with a bandage: and let the practitioner stand over the head of the patient, and the patient be seated.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 "Then the practitioner should open a vein for a large bloodletting to its full length.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 "Then draw out from the blood a moderate amount, or as much as you see is necessary for that purpose.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 "Then do likewise with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 "Afterwards, loosen the bandage and bind the two veins tightly in the middle, so that the patient is not overly weakened.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 "And leave it (the bandage) until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 "For the wound will heal.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 "¶ On bloodletting from the veins according to al-Zahrawi.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 "The uses of bloodletting from the veins according to al-Zahrawi are for aphthous ulcers in the mouth, gum infection, malignant ulcers, and lip fissures, as well as malignant ulcers in the nose and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 "And the manner of these bloodlettings is that you should have the patient sit before you and bind their neck with a bandage.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 "Then turn back the lip and look for the two veins, one from the right side of the lip and the other from the left; both are indicated by their blackness.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 "And this is true, for around them are tiny black veins." ›
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 "Cut both with an oblique cut.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 "But if you are unsure and do not know which is the larger one, then proceed to cut the more prominent of the two veins.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And likewise, do the same with two veins that are in the upper lip; indeed, custom runs mostly with it. And cut two veins that are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 After bloodletting from the sublingual vein following cephalic vein bloodletting.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 However, the benefit of bloodletting from two veins under the tongue is that it is for pre-conditions in the throat, inflammation of the tonsils, and conditions of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the manner of bloodletting them is that the patient sits between your hands facing the sun; and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for another vein; and the color of both inclines towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Therefore, bloodlet both; and be careful not to end your hand in bloodletting them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For under it are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries will occur.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 ¶ On the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 There are three veins that are bloodletted in the elbow; the custom of bloodletting them has run among all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And their bloodletting is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Either by pricking with a wide myrtle bloodletting instrument, or with a needle made thin and pointed; or by cutting with a surgical knife, which is an al-nisi.  
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus the al-nisi is suitable for cutting.     
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from them are broad and thin forms according to the width of the veins and their narrowness. The form of a myrtle bloodletting instrument should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it is suitable for opening hollow veins, full veins, projecting veins, visible veins, large veins, and those that contain thick, cloudy blood.   
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this vein is narrower and more delicate at its extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 And it applies to the phlebotomy of fine veins that contain fine yellowish blood
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 § On the phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 But the basilic is one of these three veins, and its phlebotomy is beneficial.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it draws blood from diseases that are under the throat and neck, since it follows the chest and belly; and it is fitting for the phlebotomist to be cautious when he bleeds this vein, because there is an artery beneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, if he errs and increases the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will result.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to puncture her with a phlebotome; or rather, he should cut with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 But if the basilic does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to displace it and change to another, or seek some branch of it; or instead of the phlebotome, use a thread from the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 For she is clear to see, and cut her with the Anesil phlebotome, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 But if you wish to bleed her from the same place, then it is necessary first to bind the arm tightly, so that you may touch the spot until you find the pulse's place.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark the spot with wax, afterwards bind the arm tightly, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the Anesil phlebotome, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And be careful that the puncture does not fall through the space to the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see, after binding the ligature, swelling at the place which you marked with wax, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery; therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 "If you see the blood during bleeding jump like a boy's urine and it is fine, red; then know that it is from an artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Then hasten and place your finger on it with a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If the blood is cut off (for often it is cut off), then bind the arm and leave it, and the patient should be cautious about moving it, and he should keep still out of fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And he should not move it for several days until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 But if the blood is not cut off and it overcomes you, and you do not have medicine at hand in that moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its ends contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of a fig tree and pound it; take one half and bind it over the place of the vein with a suitable bandage, with thread and wool until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if not, then care for it with that of which the previous memory was reminded for cutting off the flow of blood; and its cutting off is not difficult in many positions because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of tying from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 ¶ On the bleeding of the dark vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 However, the bleeding of the dark vein is a beneficial procedure because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica and a branch of the Cephalic, as we have said.  />
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it is fitting for the one bleeding this vein to be careful, because under it there is a nerve.  />  \\
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 Therefore, if he errs in the puncture and finds a nerve, a shock occurs, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it does not heal at all.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 This nerve often appears to be sensitive.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 But if it is hidden in some people and is thin and does not show itself, then you should place your bloodletting where you can bleed with the help of alnus-wood, and avoid the nerve with all your might.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 But if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 About the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 But bloodletting of the cephalic vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and helps with eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And in this vein you should bleed with a blunt lancet or a myrtle lancet if you wish, because it is safer than all other veins, since there is no artery beneath it, nor any nerve. 》
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 However, it is appropriate for you during bloodletting to avoid the head of the biceps with the lancet and seek a softer place: and it does no harm if the vein is not found on the first strike, that you strike over it several times with the lancet.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 However, perhaps it becomes swollen in some people if it is not found on the first strike, but that swelling does no harm to anyone. 》 》
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 About the usefulness of bloodletting and the precautions to be observed in it. 》
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The quality and effects of bloodletting depend on the person whose condition you are correcting.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 Therefore, first you should know that bloodletting is not administered except for the preservation of health and its continuation and precaution against the approach of diseases. 》 》 》 》 》 》
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And let bloodletting be done on one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the cephalic, the dark, and the basilic. 》 》 》 》 》
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And to perform a bloodletting at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer; and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 And let the bloodletting be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 But the bloodletting that is administered in illnesses does not have a fixed time; but when suitable and necessary conditions call for it, at night or day, and at every hour, and in every season.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 And children should not be bled until they are fourteen years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 Nor should a pregnant woman be bled unless from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 And old men who have already passed sixty years should not be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 Therefore, when someone wants to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that he cleanse his intestines before the bloodletting with a gentle enema, if much feces are retained within them; so that during the bloodletting, the veins do not draw harmful putrid excess from the intestines into the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 Nor should the patient who is suffering from toctina (i.e., nauseating fullness) be bled, nor one who is drunk or recovering from drunkenness, until it is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 Nor a sick person with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 And one should avoid bloodletting again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, labor, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, and everything else that weakens the strength from bodily or animal substance. ➤
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines; if it is possible for him, let him do it.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then let him enter the bath, if nothing prevents him; or he should exercise in some way, so that the blood may be made subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And place his bloodletting in the chest, around the third day, as we said: and strive that on that day his chest be evacuated of all harmful animal accidents such as distress, anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents such as labor, punishment, excess, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let him make present things for his seat from those with which human custom has run through usage, such as fragrance, scent, and joy, and similar things, in a possible amount.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the bloodletter sit on a seat higher than the bleeding seat; afterwards, he shall extend his arm and rub it himself with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then let him bind the string with a cord and wrap it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the binding be moderate, for a binding that is unequal or too tight hinders the flow of blood; and likewise, if it is too loose, it also hinders the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after binding, it is necessary for the one to be bled to rub his hands together until the veins swell and become perceptible.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then let the bloodletter clean the bleeding site with a little old oil properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then let him place the index finger of his left hand lightly on the vein below the spot where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and the blow is missed.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 For some veins are like a fleeing string at the time of bleeding; and there are those that are full of air; and when you place the incision on them, they contract under the blade and deceive the bloodletter, so that the incision does not open the vein; and if it opens it, it is tight; therefore, let the bloodletter be firm and attentive in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then he will set down the bloodletting instrument.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If, therefore, the vein is opened by one incision, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then try again with another incision in that place, or above it hastily, if the area does not become inflamed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If the site becomes inflamed or the patient fears it, then leave him for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 For perhaps a hot abscess may be drawn out.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Nor should he enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then he should repeat the bloodletting if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small, or if the blood runs thinly and you fear that not enough will flow out as desired, then repeat the bloodletting in the same hole, along its length, adding a little to your procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And do this quickly, before the site becomes inflamed, for an inflamed site is common in many people during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 Therefore, if you see that it is already inflamed, then do not repeat on the same spot at all, for it will not work for you in any case.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And place some of the oil's dregs upon it, for this soothes the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 And this is better in this case than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And likewise administer the oil's dregs in every bloodletting of yours where you prevent the flow of blood, as do theriac and alfalfa when one of them is placed on the site.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 For the blood becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If a large abscess occurs at the site of bloodletting, for this often happens, especially to those who are not usually bled or if the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and place upon the site a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly; and bind it on for one hour, for this dissolves [the abscess]. >()
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And you should do this after the blood has left that vein, either at its end or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If some blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it does not matter. And if you wish, put something dissolved from aloe or myrrh on it; or something from the juice of peppermint, that is, pennyroyal, or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And indeed, swellings and prominences often occur with the bloodletting of the Basilic vein.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Therefore, place your hand on it; if you find softness under your pressure upon it, then that prominence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Beware therefore to put anything on it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But make a plaster for it with that which has an astringent property, so that the place may be hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 And it is necessary to draw blood from every person according to their strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And that which appears from the prevailing color of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 For if the blood is black, then let it cease to flow until it becomes red; and likewise, if you see it thick, then let it stop until it becomes thin; and likewise, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 And it is necessary that he who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the venesection of the vein be increased, and let the incision be wide; and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of this.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 And it is necessary to draw from him in intervals, and that the opening be narrow; and better in venesection of the vein is that there be a transverse cut, not a prick.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 And this method of bloodletting is safe from excessive bleeding and from cutting the nerve, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 And one who is accustomed to fainting during bloodletting should eat before the procedure a moderate amount of bread soaked in pomegranate juice or wine if it is heated; and you should draw out the blood from him in three or four stages.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 And if he has a cold temperament, then before bloodletting let him eat bread soaked in syrup of myrobalan or sweetened with honey and spices, or in aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If fainting occurs during bloodletting and the cause is much bleeding, then he should drink water from broth and a thin aromatic syrup; and let him use aromatics with almonds and anoint his chest with it; and let him use the other things that we mentioned in the division of the chapter on fainting after evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 But one who wants to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time should do so gradually according to the strength of the bloodletting, day by day.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 But if he who wants to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time has a strong body, then let him do this after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 But if one wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side than to which it inclines, then let him be bled on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 In whose body the blood is already heated and sharpened, causing fever to arise, it is necessary for blood to come out in one go, and a large quantity should be drawn; and the opening should be widened until fainting occurs. Afterwards, observe all the conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 Often indeed this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and carelessness sets in.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 And it is not fitting that when one wishes to release the arm and let out blood a second time, after the orifice of the vein has already been closed and exit of the blood becomes difficult, that pressure be applied over it with force, and that it be quickly stretched outwards.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 For that is very bad; indeed, leave it alone until it has been phlebotomized a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomy that which has clotted from the blood at the vein's orifice, and place over it some salt dissolved in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 And place over it some theriac of alfaroqh or sajzeena, and apply a gentle pressure until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 But if the vein has already become swollen, then leave it alone and do not cover it until the swelling subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 But if necessity compels one to let out blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize over the same place or in another vein of another arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The cord of the arm is phlebotomized at the place called the Dark Vein and the Imperial Vein, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the patient should put his hand into warm water until it reddens and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then let it be tied over it with a bandage of moderate tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then let the phlebotomy be made transversely, little by little, not latitudinally, nor along its length; and let the opening be wide; and your phlebotomy should be such that you phlebotomize it over the wrist a little.  />
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 But if the exit of blood is hindered, then immerse your hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 If however you are in the days of summer, then abstain from washing your hands in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 And indeed the course of blood is greatly increased in hot water in winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And venesection of this vein is safer than all other veins because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 However, venesection of the right hand of the Saluatella is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 And the quality of its venesection is that you should tie a band around the hand with a ligament, or your own hand, after you have inserted it into hot water until the vein swells and becomes very perceptible to touch.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then make an incision in it by cutting across.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you cut it completely through, it will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 And take care not to cut your hand with the lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For beneath it are the bare nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh. 》
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then dip your hand again in hot water and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not dip it in hot water, the blood will clot at the mouth of the vein and be prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 When you have drawn out as much blood as is necessary, then place on the vein oil and salt, so that it may not heal quickly. 》
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And likewise it should be done with every tied-off branch. 》
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 However, the benefit of venesection from the left hand is that it is beneficial for spleen diseases. Do the same with its venesection as you did with the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The benefit of saphenous vein venesection is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as uterine diseases, retention of menses, kidney illnesses, old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar conditions.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 And the quality of its venesection is that the patient puts his foot into warm water and makes a rubbing until the veins swell; and bind above the ankle with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 And the place of the veins is at the heel, appearing towards the big toe; and many branches extend from it on the sole of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore, let venesection be done in its wider branch or at the heel in its collection; because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 But if you venesect it on the sole of the foot, then be careful not to cut into the nerves that are beneath it on the sole of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 And place your venesection so that you venesect it from the side, as if you wanted to cut across it; and let the venesector be Nasil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 But if the flow of blood is blocked, then dip his foot into warm water and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 But if the venesector errs in the first attempt, then repeat the venesection a little higher up; for it is a safe place and you need not fear harm when you avoid the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The place of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel on the side towards the little toe.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 And the benefit of its venesection is for pain in the ankle when it is due to hot blood.  />
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 And the quality of its venesection is that the patient enters the bath and bathes quickly; and bind his leg from the side of the ankle up to above the heel with four fingers' width, using a thin, long bandage; for it does not appear except through that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 Therefore, when it appears, then venesect it in whatever way is possible for you; either by transverse venesection, which is better, or by making an incision or a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 The place of it is safer, and it is hidden greatly in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you do not find it and it does not appear to the touch at all: then make an incision in some of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the sole of the foot and towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and let a quantity of blood flow from it as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then release the constriction, and place a piece of skin over the place of the incision, and bind the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 ¶ On Cupping and its Usefulness.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter 98
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 Cups are made from horns, and from metal, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And cupping is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With scarification and bloodletting; the other way is without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this cupping which is without scarification, is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 For it is either with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the cups which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are applied to fourteen places on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 One of these is the cupping on Alnocrat, which is at the base of the skull; and Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck; and the cups called Alhagdahim, which are two, placed on either side of the neck together; and the cup for the chin, which is under the jaw on the lower part of the face; and the cups for the two shoulders; and the cup for the end of the tail; and the cups for the two groins, which are in the middle of the two thighs; and the cups for the two knees. />
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And cupping does not draw blood from the small dispersed veins in the flesh, and because of this it does not cause weakness as happens with bloodletting.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 And it is not appropriate to administer cupping, either with fire or without fire, for any illnesses that arise from fullness until the entire body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity compels one to cupping due to illness or habit, we administer it at any time of the month: at the beginning, the middle, and the end.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 This is because there are men who, when their blood increases until they need its extraction through cupping, find heaviness and headache.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And among them are those who find itching in their face and forehead, darkness and dullness in their eyes.  /> And there are some who, when blood increases in them to the point of needing extraction through cupping, experience pain in their kidneys and groin.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And among them are those who itch the site of their cupping.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And among them is he whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And among them is he who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or his tongue swells and he spits blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And among them is he whose sleep increases.  /> And there are those who, when their blood increases until they need its extraction through cupping, experience pain in various parts of their body.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And among them is he who sees blood and redness, the dead, wounds, and similar things in his sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 Therefore, when we see any of these things and especially if it is in the third week of the month, we advise cupping to be done after two or three hours have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The benefit of cupping the back of the neck is that it helps with heaviness in the head and what is released goes to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 However, this should be done after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And this cupping is the equivalent of cephalic bloodletting.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 And it is not permitted for one of cold temperament, or who has a cold, to use it.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 For it causes great harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And because of this, it is not fitting that the elderly use it, or those whose heads are afflicted with cold illnesses.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 But if one becomes habituated to it, memory loss occurs in him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And because of this, it is necessary to instruct the cupping therapist to briefly lower his hand with the cup towards the lower parts, fearing the onset of memory loss.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Cupping or Alkehel is effective in place of dark bloodletting and basilica bloodletting, and for this reason it benefits asthma, chest tightness, breathlessness, broken ribs, cough, and congestion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 And it is necessary to briefly apply the cup of Alkehel, because if it is placed lower down, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 However, cupping of the alhagdahim is beneficial for headaches, eye diseases, migraines, sinus problems, and toothache; and it takes the place of basilica bloodletting.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And it is necessary to instruct the cupping therapist not to press too hard with the scarification: so that he does not cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.   Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Cupping under the chin is beneficial for mouth ulcers, gum disease, and similar oral conditions; it serves as a substitute for bloodletting on the lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Cupping with the spoon-shaped instrument is beneficial for acute fever, which arises from congestion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 Cupping the inner parts of the two thighs is as beneficial as bloodletting from the three veins – basilica, dark, and cephalic; for it draws blood from all the small veins in the flesh, and those small veins draw from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three main veins.   Ventosatio autem alueoli, confert in egritudinibus pectoris: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae, et Fuscae: quoniam peruenit ad uenas interiores cardinis: et sunt ibi omnes uenae Basilicae, et Fuscae.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 And you should instruct the Cupping Specialist not to proceed too much with scarification, because the place is bare of flesh and beneath it are nerves and blood vessels.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 And cupping over the Alchausos [area] is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 And you should instruct the Cupping Specialist to use a large cupping glass and one made of metal, because this place needs strong suction, and perhaps delicate glasses may break; and it should be scarified with a deep incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 But cupping of the legs reduces manifestly, because it draws blood from the entire body and is beneficial for old pains in the kidneys, womb, and bladder; it provokes menstruation, and is beneficial for bothrosis and adamantinum [conditions?]; and it takes the place of bleeding two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 Nevertheless, they greatly weaken the body and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And cupping of the alhorcobeni is almost as beneficial as cupping both legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the positioning of the cupping glasses is that you should first place the glass empty and draw with moderate suction; and do not prolong the positioning of the glasses, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors may come to the place equally; and do not cease to repeat and continue this, until you see the place already turning red and swelling, and the redness of blood appears; then scarify, and continue with gradual suction.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider in the disposition of bodies [i.e., of patients].
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For a person who is delicate in flesh and has large pores, you should scarify him only once, not more, so that the place does not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And instruct the Cupping Specialist to widen the scarification and make it shallow; and to regulate the suction with ease, speed, and gentle movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is a thickening of the blood, then it is necessary that you cauterize him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 Indeed, the first cauterization opens the way to the thinning and moistening of the blood, and the second cauterization thoroughly searches out and extracts the thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 However, if the blood is very foul, then let there be a third cauterization, so that it may come to an end.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And finally, when we want to draw out the blood little by little or temporarily, one cauterization is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we wish to extract much blood, we cauterize with many cauterizations.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we judge that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to cauterize with a deep cauterization, and the equal limit of depth in the cauterization is the thickness of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 ¶ What is that which ought to be administered from the oils at the position of the kidneys, and what should the one performing cupping avoid?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In the case of a person whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are constricted, it is necessary to anoint the places where the cups will be applied with open, soothing, dissolving oils; if it is in summer, such as alkeiri oil, or violet oil, or oil of sweet almonds, or oil of pumpkin seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is in winter, then use oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or oil of safflower, and similar oils.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 However, if the excess is thick and cold, then let the oil be made from ammi, or balsam oil, or oil of sweet basil, or oil of dill, and similar oils. ●
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If the person to be cupped has large pores and soft flesh, then it is necessary to prevent him from using oil, and it is necessary for these persons to wash the places of the cups with rose water or cold water or saltwater or pumpkin water or purslane water, and similar waters.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 The person whose blood is very moist should rinse wind-related conditions with vinegar or myrtle water and sumac, and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 The person whose discharges are thick should rinse their wind-related conditions with old wine or sumac water, or anise infusion, or chamomile, and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 And it is necessary to avoid wind-related conditions in the bath or in the vicinity of the bath; indeed, it is necessary that a remedy be given after leaving the bath for an hour or two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And it is not appropriate for someone to sleep after experiencing wind-related conditions.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 ¶ What should be used to treat the ventoses or the phlebotomized person before wind-related conditions?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And after that you should consider first whether the ventosed or phlebotomized person is choleric and whether sharpness and inflammation predominate over his blood; then it is necessary for him to receive cooling substances, such as pomegranate juice, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and chicory, and vetch; and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 And let his food be moist, and let him eat lean mutton, and let his dishes be seasoned with sour (foods); and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 And the person whose temperament is cold should drink syrup made of honey or almonds, or a decoction of seeds; and he should drink moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new; and it is recommended that he use a small amount of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 And let his food be moist, and let him eat quail and thrushes, that is, small birds; and he should eat the meat of young pigeons.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 And it is necessary that on the day of ventosing and phlebotomy the drink should be more than the food; and it is necessary to give in some people's drink theriac or alfaroch in certain hours before ventosing, or before phlebotomy, or after, so that the main limbs are strengthened and the blood is made subtle.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 And it is not necessary for them to take it in hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 On Venesection without Scarification
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 Venesections without scarification are those placed on the liver, spleen, gout, abdomen, navel, and the kidney area; because these parts of the body do not tolerate scarification.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 And through these [venesections], we do not seek anything other than the drawing of blood from one part to another, such as when we place a venesection on the breasts in the case of nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to dissolve the cold and unpleasant fullness from one part of the body into another, such as when we place a venesection on the abdomen and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For it rarefies the part of the body [and] heats it up and removes pain because it dissolves that fullness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 It is also placed on the kidneys when there occurs in them a stone or calculus.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 For perhaps by the power of its attractive nature it opens up the stone or extracts the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly when it is placed on the liver and spleen for treating fullness in both organs.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 And these venesections are administered empty, with only a cut.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes they are administered with fire [cautery].
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in cases of pleurisy: and this is done by filling the venesection cup [with warm water] and making it large; with hot water alone or water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 The shape of a venesection administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 Let the width of its opening be that of two extended fingers, as we have described; and let its depth be half a palm; and let there be on one side of it a small hole about the size of what will admit a needle, made from brass or tin, thick-rimmed, smooth, even, polished; so that it does not harm the part where it is placed upon it; and let there be in its center a crosswise rod of brass or iron on which the candle with fire is placed.  [Note: The translation above includes a small correction to the Latin text, changing "eius" to "suum."]
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 "And now it becomes this large wound, larger than we have described, and somewhat smaller, according to the illnesses and age of the person using it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 "For the windpipes of children and thin individuals are different from those of men and thick-bodied individuals.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 "The method of placing this woundpipe with fire on a member is as follows: light linen wick or a small candle made from tallow, and place it on the middle of the crosspiece which is in the middle of the windpipe, so that the fire burns around the lower part of the windpipe, without burning the body of the patient.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 "Then place it on the member; and let a finger be over the opening which I mentioned, while we are holding the windpipe. When needed, remove the finger, and the vapor will exit through that opening, and the windpipe will immediately become unblocked.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 "Then light the linen wick in its usual manner, and use it again if you need to.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 "However, in the windpipe used in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no crosspiece or opening, and it is not applied except when filled with water and placed on the member alone.
Et haec est forma eius.	 "And this is its shape.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 "The larger this windpipe is, so that it may hold much water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 "About the suspension of cupping glasses.
Caput XCIX.	 "Chapter Ninety-Nine.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 "Cupping glasses are not applied to many places except where the placement of windpipes is not possible due to their small size, such as the lip and gums, and similar areas.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 "Or on members that have been stripped of flesh, such as fingers, noses, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 "And the way to use them is: come from cupping glasses that are in sweet and pure waters, free from decay." 》
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they are let go day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and there is nothing left in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Then the body is first evacuated with bloodletting and cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then clean the afflicted part until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Afterwards they are placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are full and fall off, and it is possible to draw out the pus with cupping, then this is more beneficial in the end; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then rinse thoroughly with water, rub it, and squeeze it out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the flow of blood is prolonged after the fall of leeches, and this is due to sweating, then pour a linen cloth into cold water and place it on top until the sweating ceases.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If the blood increases, then sprinkle powdered alum or oak galls and similar astringents on top until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or place half-peeled broad beans on the spot and let them stay until they stick to the place, for then the bleeding will stop.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And if a repetition of leeches is necessary, when possible, change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 If, however, the leeches are prevented from taking hold, then clean the place with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or prick with a needle until some blood comes out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then place them on, for when they sense something from the blood, they immediately stick on.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When you want them to fall off, sprinkle some powdered aloe, salt, or ash on top of them, and they will fall off immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 A Universal Discourse on Reduction and Relocation, Treatment of Torsion, and Similar Conditions.
Caput I.	 Chapter 1
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine; it deals with the restoration of broken and dislocated bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know, O Sons, that the foolish physicians and common people boast about this chapter, those who have never seen an ancient book nor read a single letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for this reason, this method has become rare among the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have never encountered anything good in it at all, and I would not have gained from it what I have gained except through the long reading of ancient books and diligent study to understand them, until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then, throughout my life, I persisted in experimentation and study.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 And now I have described to you in this chapter all that my knowledge contains on the subject: and as for what is beyond my experimentation, after abbreviating it for you, I have freed it from the tedium of length, and abbreviated it to the point of abbreviation, and shown it at the point of conclusion. And I have formed in it many shapes from the shapes of instruments used in it, by adding a conclusion, as I did in the two preceding chapters. ➤
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 Summations and collections concerning the fracture of bones, from which preface is necessary before we begin to recall the broken members, and various ones if each one individually.
Caput II.	 Chapter 2
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 In the preface of this chapter, it is appropriate to state the summaries and topics that are essential for understanding them in the first place: so that you and those who are ready may know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 I say, therefore, that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or fall occurs to someone, you should hurry in the first place to bleed him and evacuate him, or both at once: unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength; or he is a child to whom one of those things happened; or he is an old decrepit man; or it is a time of very hot weather, or very cold. ➤
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then let him be content with his food, with cold vegetables and the meat of birds and kids. And forbid wine and heavy meats, and filling up from food and all foods that fill the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until you are secure from the hot swelling, and do not fear the discharge of matter to the member; then let the patient return to his original diet with which he was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the fractured bone begins to heal, then it is necessary that the patient be fed with foods that are very nourishing, thick, heavy, and viscous; such as bread made from cooked wheat with water, rice, heads, feet, and entrails of cows, eggs, and fresh fish: and heavy wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 For this diet causes the fracture to heal faster and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in the early stages of old age and decrepit, cannot always be held together and healed according to their nature because of the dryness of their members; but those which are in the last stage of softness heal and come together like the bones of small children. 》
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 Nevertheless, nature attaches above the fractured bone from every side something similar to glue, which has thickness and by which it adheres and binds itself together until they cohere with one another and are bound together, until it reaches the end of strength and firmness as it was at first, so that nothing prevents it from its own operations. And for this reason, it is necessary that you place the patient's food in nourishments which have heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And know that the kinds of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the members; for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone, and similarly all other members differ from one another. And I will come with a description of every kind of fracture set forth in its own chapter, distinct from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 And the types of bone fractures are also varied among themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Because it happens that the fracture is curved, besides which stones fall into it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes the fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and its fractures are staggered, that is, stones, and protruding additions, as they are in a reed when adapted to writing with a knife.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not protruding: and the fracture is accompanied by a wound and rupture at the end: and the fracture is a small cleft.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And every type has its own skill or instrument for its restoration, as will be recalled later, distinguished by their places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And by which a bone fracture is recognized is its twistedness and prominence; and its appearance to the touch; and the sound it makes when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 Therefore, when there is no apparent twistedness in the place, nor a sound to the touch with movement, and the patient does not experience great pain; then there is no fracture there, but perhaps it is a twist or a small cleft. So you should not move it at all with your hand and pressing, but rather apply on it from the medicines whose reminder comes after the appropriate moment for that place: then let it be bound with a fine bandage.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And know that when the place is curved and split into two, besides which stones fall into it, nevertheless every part will be separated from its partner; then you should begin at the hour for its rectification, leveling it before a hot abscess forms on it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 But if a hot abscess has formed on it, then leave it for some days until the abscess calms down.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then level it by whatever means you can, with gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that its restoration and its equalization is easier than that of bone, in which fractures occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then bind it according to how you remember it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 But if there are fractures in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb from two sides, whether it is a hand or a foot: either with your hand, if it is a small member; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And your position should be such that you place the member on an equal place, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended: then strive with all skill and in whatever way you can to bring those additions back to their places; and be careful not to cause pain or injury to the weak person due to your operation. And strive as much as you can to join one of the two bones with its mate, according to the best shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 And it is necessary at that time for you to test and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 So if you see something different there, correct it, and equalize that according to the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And beware of excessive extension and strong compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For often through their operation they cause a hot abscess or contracture in the member, as we have already seen many times from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then after equalization and proper operation and binding of that limb, and rest and peace, instruct the patient concerning it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And make him take care not to move it during his watchfulness and sleep and turning and movement, and in his discharge and all his last movements with all his strength. 》
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And so that he may take care not to place the member in a position that causes pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 "For when he feels pain or injury in the position of a limb, then it is necessary that you change it to another position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 "And be careful with him that his position is equal and straight so that there is no twisting in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 "The quality of the tightness of a broken limb is as I will describe.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 "Know that broken limbs are distinguished by their smallness and size, and also by their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 "Therefore, from those that are small, such as the arm, finger, and knee, then it is necessary for there to be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 "But from those that are thick, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary for there to be a wide, hard wrapping.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 "Because the broad ligature joins together a large limb and holds it tightly from all sides with equal tightness, so that no swelling enters into it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 "Then begin to apply a suitable ointment after your equalization on soft cotton wool over the site of the break.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 "Then begin to wrap the bandage over the site of the break three or four times, according to what the limb deserves; and hold your hand for a moment with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 "Then go with it to the upper part from the site of the break and tighten less than your previous tightness where you bound the broken site.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 "Then extend yourself with the wrapping from the break for a short while and gradually lessen the tightness until you take something large from the healthy part.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 "Then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken site with bindings.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 "Afterward, go with the wrapping to the lower part from the break.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And let your operation be in the tightening of the swelling, and its softening, according to what we have said about the first upper swelling.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the swellings some soft tow or cloth, which matches the twist of the break, if there is any twist to it; and if not, do not put anything inside.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then wrap another bandage over that same roll.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Afterward, apply to these bandages some neatly-made plasters of equal size immediately, if there is no swelling or hot abscess at the site.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 But if there is swelling or an abscess at the site, then place upon it something to ease that abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then bind those plasters over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 And let the plasters be made from half-reeds, scraped and cleverly shaped; or they may be made of wood from which strainers are made, which are made from pine, or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi; and let the size of every plaster correspond to this shape and this same form.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, the plaster that is placed over the wound itself should be somewhat thicker and broader than the other plasters; and let the length of the plaster correspond to what is permitted by the member’s size or smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then bind the plasters with another bandage in the same manner as the first binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then tie it securely with neat stitches in the manner that we have described for the binding; and know that your binding should be greater over the site of the break; and as the distance from the break increases, let the binding become smaller.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 And know that the thread should be of medium thickness and fineness, and it should be made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 For if the thread is thick, as I have seen done by foolish people who use twisted linen cords for their threads, there is a great mistake; because the binding will fall outside the proper manner with them.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And fine threads are not suitable again: because you will not achieve through them what you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 And it is not fitting for there to be less than a finger's width between the hooks.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 But if the patient is injured by the tips of the hooks after the suturing in healthy places, then place soft wool or boiled wool under them until he is no longer harmed by it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 But when there is a fracture with a wound and a tearing of the skin occurs, I will make an exception for it in Chapter Two, one by one.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every broken bone should be sutured with hooks from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 This is because a large bone should not have hooks placed on it unless after five days or seven, or more, according to your assurance against the occurrence of a hot swelling.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is the method of plasters by which the ancients used to treat fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 The method of a common abbreviated plaster for restoring fractures, suitable for most complexions, especially women and children, since it is made from that which neither heat nor cold can overcome.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is made by taking the flour dust from the mill, which is the innermost part of the flour that hangs on the walls of the mill during its operation. Prepare this just as it is, except that you should sift it with egg white. And make its preparation neither too thick nor too thin.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another method of plaster for restoring fracture, dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Take mastic, labdanum, acacia, henbane, and mustard; and the juice of all of them 10 parts, myrrh and both kinds of aloe 5 parts each, and aleth 20 parts. Grind all together, sift, and mix with aleth water or with egg white if the patient's complexion is hot.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is of good composition, it quickly restores broken bones and helps many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method for the plaster, which also benefits fractures and dislocations.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Take mugwort and mesquite and white althea, all in equal parts, one dram of each; also take myrrh and both kinds of aloe, half a dram of each; and Armenian bole six drams; grind all these together finely, sift them, and prepare with water or egg white.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Another method for the plaster, to be used for dislocations and separated bones from their place; it also eases the pain that occurs in them, bone fissure, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Take greasy wool, soak it in vinegar and boiled oil, and place it on the site.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 And indeed this plaster has no power of restoration, but it is good for the soothing of hot inflammation and properly expels pain.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Another method for the plaster that restores a broken bone. ️
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take leaves of the deaf fig and wild poppy leaves; grind all together and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Another method for an abbreviated plaster to be used in the restoration of a bone fracture and when you wish to resolve any remaining inflammation.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Take the root of althea, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and cudweed flour, all in equal parts; grind all together and prepare with wine if the limb is not hot.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it is hot, then prepare it with water of fresh coriander or with water and use that.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another method for a stronger plaster for the resolution of inflammation than this first one, when a hard inflammation occurs during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Recipe of alteae root, flax seed, balaustia, melliloti, samsuci, violet flower, and chamomile, all in equal parts; grind them all together and prepare with willow water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 All of it should be prepared according to the warmth of the member and the state of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a fractured member at the time of its restoration except for an unguent made from wax and oil—nothing else—and he reported that it is a medium between thickness and thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galen, however, considered it beneficial to place on a fractured member at the time of its restoration substances that dry out heat, such as myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, and similar things from those we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 § The method of the plaster which is beneficial for injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Take equal parts of mugwort, chickpea, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, altea, and salt; grind them, sift them, and make a plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The quantity in which it should remain until the ligature is dissolved, and then be removed, is that you should consider then if no pain occurs to the patient, nor itching, nor does the broken bone move from its place; then do not remove it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 But if intense itching occurs there, or disturbing pain, or swelling, then hasten and remove it at that hour, and take away the plaster from him; and take a soft cloth or a soft marine sponge, wet it; and dip it in warm water and cleanse the place with it until the itching calms and the pain subsides. ¶
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then let the part rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place on it wool that has been cut and soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it on overnight, until you are sure there is no hot swelling, and the inflammation of the part subsides, and its pain is relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat with a fine binding and a small plaster: and do not bind it too tightly at first, but use gentle bindings with it, until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and all other symptoms have been completely removed, and you no longer need plaster or binding, then repeat as you did at first, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 But if none of those things happen to the part, then do not loosen it until after three, four, five, or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is released after twenty days, the whole thing, according to how the part looks upon loosening, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the flesh coagulates over it: then add more to the binding than your first complete binding; and also add to the swelling of the soft food, according to what was done before.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 But if you see the place of the fracture already drying out and becoming too thin: then know that the nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Therefore moisten it with warm water whenever you loosen it, and let it be so for all three days, and lighten the binding slightly.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 By this method, nourishment reaches the part, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 What foolish restorers do instead of the above method when a fracture is not restored properly at first, and it is set crookedly, is an error on their part, and a great fear: and if it were right, the ancients would have said so in their books, and they would have done it likewise. 
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I did not see anywhere their trace in it at all, and it is better that it should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 On the formation of a wound in the head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 The species of fracture are various and its figures many, and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For a fracture occurs which is made by striking with a sword; and the strike removes the bone entirely until it reaches the sphenoid bone, which is under the bone, just as an ax does in wood; and because of this, this species of fracture is called axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or the sword cuts something of the bone and cuts its surface, but the cut does not penetrate to its end; and this species of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, an absolutely smooth incision. ›
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And there are two kinds of wounds, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And from a fracture is what is called crushing or grinding; and its cause is striking with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this fracture can also be either penetrating, which reaches close to the membrane beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone; and there are wounds of these two kinds of fractures, either small or large. › ️
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And there is a fracture that is hidden within the bone, as fine as a hair; and it is a small crack, and because of this, this species of fracture is called capillary. › ️ ️
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And among these is the fracture that occurs from a fall or striking with a stone and similar things, which cause a fragment of bone to enter into the depths; and in its place there is a hollowing out, just as happens with copper vessels when they are struck, and part of them enters inside. ›
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 And this occurs most often in the heads of bones that are still soft, such as the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And for all these kinds of fractures, splints are separated, and I will come back with a reminder of the whole thing in its proper place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 And we know all these types of fractures by examining them, and probing them with needles, and removing the corrupted flesh that is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 But the hair-like species is recognized by this, that it is exposed on the bone and cleaned, and anointed with cautery wax on it, for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the condition of the patient: then if you see from the signs that it indicates something clear and alarming, such as vomiting bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, hoarseness, fainting, fever, bulging eyes, redness of them, and similar signs in various conditions, there is no doubt that they will not be healed. And if you see signs that do not frighten you, and you hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 That is, if the wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded, and that is in the winter days, then it is necessary for you to strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every condition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 And if it is in the summer days, then you must hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest what is under the bone from the membrane be corrupted and those signs that we have mentioned occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 But if the bone fracture has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and it is with fragments and attraction, then you must cut away the crushed and attracted part, as I will tell you.  ///
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And this is how you shave the head of the wounded person and expose the bone in whatever way possible for you according to the shape of the wound and what is lightest on the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If it happens to you during bone detection that there is bleeding or a hot abscess, then use what is necessary against it.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And it is as if you fill the place with cloth soaked in wine and rose oil, and make the wound rest until the abscess subsides, and be secure from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin the treatment of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 One method is to cut the bone with a scalpel of narrow blade, and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then administer another scalpel after the narrower one, slightly wider; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then also administer a third scalpel wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 And the second method is that you have a number of different scalpels, some broader than others and some shorter than others; and they should be sharp at their ends and made of Indian steel or forged iron; and use skill in striking over the scalpel so that it does not shake your hand and injure you.  />
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 But if the bone is hard and strong, then it is necessary that you bore around its circumference before you administer scalpels with drills called non-penetrating drills; and they are not so named except because they do not penetrate through the thickness of the fleshy part to what is behind it, on account of the fact that the extremity of the drill above that which is under its sharp head is like a small circle, similar to a rim, and it prevents sinking and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 And it is appropriate for you to take from these drills a great number whose every one suits the thickness of the bone until you have for every skull a drill; and its sharp extremity's length and breadth should be according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three types of Terebrae, or Trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of perforation around the broken bone is such that you place the Trephine on the bone and roll it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then change the Trephine to another place and put it between all the holes a quantity equal to the thickness of the radius or about that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with the Chisels what is between all the holes from the bone; and make it thinner than you can on that to the limit of thinness, as we said, until you extract the bone, either by hand or with some other of the various instruments which you have prepared for this purpose, such as tweezers and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And it is necessary that you be very careful that the Trephine or Chisel does not touch anything of the brain.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 Therefore, when you surround the bone by perforating and have separated it from the brain, if it was continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and smooth the end of what remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the Chisel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 However, it must be thin and more delicate than the other Chisels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 But if there remains anything from the small bones and splinters; then take it easily with one of the instruments that you have with you. 
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then treat the wound afterwards with the linen bandages and ointments which we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 And another method of the operation is very easy and far from fear, which Galen spoke of and praised greatly; and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 First of all, it is necessary for you to begin to uncover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is more severe and evident; until when you have uncovered that part and placed under it the end of this lenticular Chisel, which has this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 And the lentiform part does not cut anything; and its sharp part on both sides of it goes along the length, as you see: so that the lentiform part is pressed against the sphenoid bone, with its sharp part cutting into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike the incisor from one side with a small hammer until you cut through the entire bone easily, as it is turned: and you should be confident from the cloth that no accident will happen to you which you fear completely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the doctor were not more foolish or ignorant of this, and were not asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it away with the end of the lenticular part of the incisor itself, and would free it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 For it is freed from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 And if the bone fracture does not penetrate to the cloth, and that which is cut away from the bone is its surface, and there remain in it roughness and fine splinters: then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness, and to remove those splinters with fine rasps, of which you have prepared a number of various sizes, so that it may be possible for you to apply from them what is most suitable and straightest according to the operation being performed and the broken bone itself and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 And you should apply [the rasps] in order, first with the wider rasp, then with the narrower ones.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not stop doing this continuously until you reach using the thinnest and finest of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 But in every small crack or fine fracture that remains, care should be taken according to what leads to its correction.  />
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And it is a thing that is not hidden from everyone who has any interest in this art, and it stands on what we have written and demonstrated in major fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 But if the flap remains attached when you remove the bone: then it is necessary to take a linen cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil, and place it on the wound's opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth; and make that as easy to do as possible, so that the siphac is not too heavy.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then apply a broad bandage over it; and do not tighten it except to the extent that holds only the wound; and leave it with this care for one day or two days, until you are sure from hot suppuration.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then loosen it and apply afterwards the medicines with which there is excessive dryness, such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar ones: and it is that you make from these medicines a powder, which powders on the wound like dry things.  />
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And generally apply to it every medicine of which the property is that it cleanses and does not sting.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 And be careful, according to your skill, that the wound in your care is clean: and there is no grease of the ointment, nor any filthiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 Nor allow any pus to gather on it at all; for when pus gathers on the brain flap, it corrupts it and putrefies it, and a great mischief befalls the patient afterwards: and this happens with the siphac of the head, especially when its care is neglected, with blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Consider then if these accidents befall the sick person; know that it is undoubtedly fatal.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 And if the blackening does not occur except from the medicine placed on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to produce that blackening; then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and anoint a cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on the wound; afterwards care for it with suitable treatments until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 ¶ On the Restoration of the Nose when Broken
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that the nose is not broken except in its two upper parts together or one of them; for this reason, because it consists of two bones: since its lower part is cartilage, it does not break, and nothing happens to it except abrasion, twisting, and flattening.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of its two parts is broken, then you should insert a small finger into the nostril and straighten that fracture with your index finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape; and this should be done skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And take care that pain does not occur to the patient due to your procedure.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger does not reach it; then you should straighten it with a rod's end that has a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If however the fracture is in both parts, then do likewise with it; and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after seven or ten days during the quiet of a warm hematoma.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a wick of linen cloth into the nostril if the fracture is in one part; or insert two wicks if the fracture is in both parts; and let there be in the wick a thickness that fills the nostril's opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some of the ancient surgeons said that liniments should be mixed with butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 But this seems not to be the case, rather one should mix the liniment with the membrane of an egg and prepare it with flour dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then let the liniment sit until the bone hardens and the cartilage becomes firm.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of the liniment, after a soft cloth has been wrapped around it: and this holds the broken nose more firmly in place, allowing the patient to breathe without obstruction.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you wish, do that; and if you wish, make liniments.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 But if a hot abscess occurs again while you are treating the nose, apply plasters to the nose with ketone or cotton soaked in rose oil or a small amount of aquiline.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if a hot abscess does not occur, then one should apply plasters made with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg membrane.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a soft rag on top of it, and do not bind the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 But if the bones of a small broken or shattered nose are fractured, it is necessary to cut and remove them with instruments suitable for that purpose.  ()
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then suture the wound and treat it with that which promotes healing and consolidation using suitable plasters or ointments for that purpose.  ()  ()
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 But if a wound occurs between the nostrils, it should be treated with liniments, and a lead tube should be administered until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 § On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is broken and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: first observe whether the fracture is only on the outside and does not break into two parts, bending towards the inside; then its recognition is easy.  ()
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 It is therefore necessary that if there is a break in the right side, you should insert the left index finger into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the break is on the left side, then you should insert the right index finger: and push with it the swelling of the break from within easily towards the outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone properly, and make it even with that.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the jaw is already broken into two parts, then it is necessary to administer traction from both parts according to the straight line until equalization becomes possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 However, if there has already been displacement or breakage of the teeth, then you should tie those that you hope will remain in place with a thread of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place a bandage on the broken jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place on it a doubled cloth and on the cloth a large neatly made pad or an equal piece of sole skin, along the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it securely above, according to the way its ligature is prepared and its application agrees, until it does not become undone. And instruct the patient to be at rest and in peace, and give him soft foods to eat.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 However, if you think that something is changing the shape in any way, then hurry and release it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then correct what has been altered from that, and apply a plaster of powdered chalk with the membrane of an egg or with sesame flour, after you have removed the bandage: and place on the plaster soft wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While that attached plaster remains on it and the arrangement of the bone is not altered, leave it unbound, do not release it, until it heals; or bind the break.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 For often this break is bound in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If a hot abscess happens to occur, then administer that which we have often mentioned for its soothing, until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if there is a break with a wound, take note.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 For if already a fragment has separated from the bone, either of itself or by your effort: then take care to remove those fragments with what is suitable for you among the instruments used for their removal.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 But if the wound's opening is narrow, then enlarge it with a fleam according to your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then, after you have removed those fragments and none of them remain, whether the wound's opening is large or not: apply to it one of the plasters that are suitable for it, and let it heal until it is cured.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 ¶ On the restoration of the collarbone when it is broken.
Caput VI.	 Chapter Six.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 The collarbone is most often broken from the front part towards the arm, and its break occurs in one of three ways. 》
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Either it breaks and separates into two parts, besides any fragments that may occur within it: and this is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or such that fragments occur within the bone: and this is more difficult to restore. 》 》 》 》
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or such that there is a break with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the operation for it, when the break is without a wound, is as follows: make two assistants present, so that one holds support against the broken collarbone, and the other stretches the neck towards that side. 》 》 》 》
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then straighten the break with your fingers until its shape is correct as it should be: and let there not be any prominence or depression in it. 》 》 》 》
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place under the patient's neck a pad of cloth or wool: and let its size be according to your need: and extend and raise the collarbone, and squeeze the pad with your hand until you straighten the break as it should be. 》 》 》 》 》 》
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you cannot pull the end of the collarbone to the outside because it has reached deep inside, then the sick person must be laid on their back with a medium-sized pillow under their shoulder, and an assistant should press down on the shoulder until the end of the collarbone that is deep inside rises up. Then straighten the fracture and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If, however, you feel a splinter from the collarbone and it moves, then you should probe for it and remove that splinter easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If it is retained in the bone, then you should make an incision over it with one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this purpose. After placing under the collarbone the tool that preserves the splinter, and this tool is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a spoon without a bowl.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And let its width be according to what you need for the size and thinness of the bone.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 Its length should also be as much as is possible for the procedure.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And it should have two ends, as you see: one end should be wide and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If the tear of the wound that you cut when you removed the bone splinter is wide and free from pus: then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the tear is small or you fear hot pus: then fill the wound with cloths and little cushions according to the size of the tear in the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If hot pus occurs, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on the wound.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 A narrowing of the bone that is without a wound and without a cut: you should place on the bone an emplaster made from flour and egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And place soft wool over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then put a ball under its clitoris if you need to.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take a piece of linen, that is, the one that the Saracens use, which should be very long, and its width should be one palm or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place two layers of soft wool over the wool and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take a small board from a thin tablet, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.  />
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then wrap that cloth with the board in the place of the bandage that falls over the break and place.  />
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place the bandage over the break as it is rolled up, and wrap it around its neck, and under its healthy clitoris, and under its broken clitoris; and bring it back over all parts, so that you see that the tightness holds the break tightly: and this is not hidden from you, so that the board does not move away from the mouth of the break.  />  />  />  />
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 And for this reason it is necessary to examine the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 Therefore, whenever the bandage softens and you see that the board has already moved away, then straighten it and tighten the bandage.  />  />  />  />  />  />
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the patient's pillow on his back, and place under his clitoris near his pillow a small bolster at night, so that it will lift his support from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Thus the break of the collarbone is healed by lifting the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or tie his arm to his neck; and do not untie the bandage unless an accident occurs in that place from itching or from a boil, up to twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster if you see its face turned towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And for the narrowing, and let it go until it is restored and clotted.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 And indeed the break of the collarbone is bound and strengthened most especially on the twenty-eighth day, and sometimes it happens in some men on a lesser one.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 About the restoration of the fracture of the scapula.
Caput VII.	 Chapter Seven.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 The scapula is rarely broken and only in its broad part; from it nothing breaks except its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When therefore a place is broken from it, and it breaks in its middle, and it is not known except by touch, then according to what is the figure of the fracture attempt its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And reduce it into its natural form in every way possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then put on the place powder of pounding with egg white, and soft tow, and put a little bit of doubled cloth on top.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then put on it a wide splint made from thin board according to the size of the entire scapula or somewhat larger than that.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If however there is any hollow under the splint in some place of the scapula, then even out that hollow with soft tow until the splint descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then bandage it on top with a long binding of decent tightness and the firmness of the splint, until it is not removed from its place. >()
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And examine the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever therefore the bandage is softened, bind it again and even out the splint if it has moved from its place; and let the patient lie on his sound side. 
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And indeed the scapula is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When therefore this number is completed, then loosen the bandage; and you should be secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it is of bones whose comminution is not to be feared nor their dissolution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If, however, it comes from a piece of bone and pierces under the skin, then cut open above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do as we said in the case of a broken collarbone from an inflamed abscess, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 ¶ On the restoration of a rib fracture.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter Eight.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 The chest sometimes breaks in the middle and this happens rarely.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Its extremities are more often broken and crushed by its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When its middle is broken and it leans toward the lower part, a severe pain occurs and difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps it vomits blood, and a depression is indicated on the broken bone, which does not escape notice. The restoration of it is to place the patient on his back and put pillows under his shoulder blades.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press his shoulders and gather the ribs together from both sides with your hands: and straighten it in its place, as much as possible and is suitable, until the shape of the bone returns as needed. 》
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place a plaster and wool on it, and put a board made of thin willow or poplar wood, or similar light woods, on top after you wrap it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then secure it by tying it on the broken bone so that it does not move: and go around with the bandage following the curvature of the back several times and bind it firmly. 》 》
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then examine the bandage every hour and whenever it loosens, tighten it: and if its necessity requires its removal due to itching, or corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or abscess, then hasten and remove it, and take off the plaster, and correct what has happened with the method of its treatment. 》 》 》 》
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a poultice, if you see a swelling there; and attach a bandage to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 ¶ On the Restoration of Ribs When They Are Broken
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 Know that the fracture of ribs occurs only in thick places which follow the spine and from their extremities toward the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And wear does not occur to them except because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And its detection is not hidden from the touch by investigation with fingers. ➤
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And its restoration is performed by making the fracture even with fingers to the greatest extent possible until it matches the shape as required.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then apply a poultice and bind the broken bone with a splint if it needs that.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 And if the fracture of ribs is slanted toward the interior, then a severe pain and sharpness occurs to the patient, similar to that which occurs to one who has pleurisy; because the bone pierces the membrane, and there also occurs difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood: and this is difficult to cure. ➤
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And the ancients have already invented many ways for this; and among them are those who say that one should give food to the patient which causes inflammation and flatulence so that the stomach is inflamed, and extended, and the fracture is pushed toward the exterior. ➤ ➤ ⟩
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 But we disapprove of this lest a quick cause be made for creating a hot abscess if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If however it has already occurred, then it increases it. ➤ ⟩ ⟩
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them have said: a poultice should be placed on the place, then sucked out with strength, and this is similar to reason.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 However, one must fear that the poultice draws superfluities to the place because of the weakness of the patient. ➤ ⟩ ⟩
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 "And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool that has already been soaked in hot oil; and small pieces of cloth are placed between the ribs, until it is filled, so that when the bandage is wrapped around it according to its roundness, the bandage will be even.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 "Then let the patient be treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 "But if a strong force constricts the patient and he cannot bear it, and his breath is pierced by a sharp sting, and we fear for the patient, then we must cut open the site and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 "Then we place upon it an instrument which preserves the sutures, whose description has already been given; and we cut the opening easily, and make the incision.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 "Then we unite the two lips of the wound with a stitch if it is large; and we treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 "But if a hot abscess forms in the meantime, then hasten and soak small pieces of cloth in rose oil, and place them on the site; and let the patient be treated with what is suitable for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 "Meanwhile, he should also lie on his side where it hurts until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 "Chapter: On the restoration of a fracture of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Caput X.	 "Chapter 10
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 "A fracture of the bones of the neck sometimes happens, but attrition rarely occurs to them; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 "So when this happens to someone, and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then consider carefully.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 "For if you see his hands already paralyzed, numb, and lifeless; and he cannot move them or extend them or contract them; and when you try to contract them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it and does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in many cases it is fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If it moves them and feels constriction with the fingers and pricking sensation: then know that the back of the bone is sound, and that the patient will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If it occurs similar to the spondylitis of the back and you wish to know if it will heal or not, then consider the feet. If you see that they have become soft and what happened in the hands has occurred in them as well; and when he lies on his back, flatulence and defecation occur without volition; and when he turns over onto his stomach, defecation occurs without volition; and if, when lying on his back, he wishes to urinate but cannot, then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore, do not labor over his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 But if nothing of that occurs to him, the condition is less severe.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for what happens to him is that you should try to reduce the swelling of the warm inflammation: so that you place on the vertebra finely ground rose oil alone, or with softened egg yolks.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place that on it several times a day until the warm swelling is reduced; then place one of the strengthening and drying plasters over it and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 And let him not sleep on the side where he finds pain until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 But if it occurs at the bone fracture or anything else that has already separated from it; then you must cut into the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then join together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with some healing ointment until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 But if the last bone of the tail is broken: then you must insert your left thumb into the anus and straighten the fractured bone with your other hand as best you can, and follow with a second straightening.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on top of the wound and remove it; and treat the wound with the previous treatment until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 The restoration of the ankle.
Caput XI.	 Chapter Eleven.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 The bones of the ankles are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they are broken, then the break is not complete but rather a comminution at their extremities; and they split along their length, inclining towards the interior; and it happens that there is pain in the spot, with a puncture; and the leg that breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And its restoration is to place your hand upon it, until you stand over the break, so that you may observe its shape.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the break is only at its extremities, then make it equal, according to what has been prepared for you from the equation, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 But if the break is along its length or already inclining towards the interior, then make the patient lie on his back until you are prepared to restore that break.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you have made it equal, place a plaster on it; then place on it a splint of wood or leather; and bind it with a binding that does not allow the displacement of the break nor the dislodgement of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And fill the concavity of the bones with something that will fill it, until the bandage takes hold of it according to its equality; and instruct the patient to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 But if he has a hot abscess, then cease from extending it and its restoration until the hot abscess settles; and place upon it that which will settle it, according to what precedes; then return to his restoration; and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 But if it happens in the bone of a joint, or if it is comminuted, remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 On the restoration of a broken rib.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The adiutorium is that which is between the elbow and the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it should break, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One of which is that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness in the following shape.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And two bands are fastened at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is suspended from a high place, and the patient sits on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then he throws his broken arm over the wood until it reaches the sensitive part of the break where the middle curve of the wood is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then something heavy is hung from above so that the assistant pulls downwards.  :=
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 The physician then straightens the break with his hands at the same time until it returns to its proper place.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 The second method is that the patient lies on his back with his head hanging down, and his arm is suspended from his neck by a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then you instruct two assistants to hold one above the break with his hands and the other below it, each pulling towards himself.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 If you wish for a stronger extension, then bind below the break with one bandage and above it with another; and each of the two assistants pulls towards himself.  :=
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If the break is near the end of the arm, then a bandage should be placed below the sensitive part and another below the break towards the elbow.  := >:
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 Similarly, if the break is near the elbow, then a bandage should be placed on that spot and another on the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then straighten the break with ease and without effort until it is set as needed and has been treated properly; then bind it if there is no hot swelling.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 If a hot abscess occurs, then release the stricture until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 And place on it wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the abscess quiets down; then bind it. And the way to bind it is that you should place a poultice on the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then put a bandage of new cloth over the poultice.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then bind the arm to itself, and let him place his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 And place a cloth and bind it over the bandaged arm, so that the arm stands in place of crutches; if nothing prevents you from doing this, then nothing will be displaced in the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 But if you fear that something may be displaced in the broken bone, then use crutches; and it is, as you should place on the break itself a crutch which is wider and stronger than the other crutches.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And place between every crutch a width of one finger; and let the length of the crutches be according to the break with an addition of three fingers on each side.  />
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then bind over the crutches the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it is that your bandage should be tighter on the place of the break.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And the more the break extends, let the bandage be smaller.  /> cdot Quia si erit longa, pertimebis ne quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid: sed si erit brevis et tenera, non timere debes ne quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 Therefore, if you see the position of the crutches and the bandage as we have said, at the hour in which you restore the limb immediately, then do this; and if you fear a hot abscess, then release the bandage and the crutches until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the bandage for three days, so that itching, swelling, or food being prevented from reaching the limb because of the accumulation of the bandage does not happen in the place.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Correct that whole thing as we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 But if it is on the basis of trust, so that nothing happens from it: then do not release the bandage until after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 And let the patient sleep on his back, and let his hand be on his belly; and put under him a bed filled with wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 And watch every hour of the night or day so that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or the bandage becomes soft.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Correct that whole thing with your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 And give the patient food according to the order we mentioned first, so that the food be fine at first until his mouth begins to tighten; then you must thicken his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For it is the custom of the bandage and the leg to tighten within forty days; therefore, it is necessary that it be released then and a bath administered, and treated with ointments that correct that.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 But if the fracture is ugly and crushed; then do not remove from it the bandage and splints until fifty days, or even two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 ¶ About the restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two humeri.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 Of these, one is small and it follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other is large, and that is the one placed under the small bone on the lower side.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore, perhaps only the larger humerus breaks, or perhaps the smaller; and perhaps they break together. ›
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 When therefore the smaller humerus breaks higher up, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when it breaks lower down, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult. › ›
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And it is worse when two bones are broken simultaneously.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If therefore the bone that is broken is slightly higher than usual, it is suitable for the physician, when restoring it, to place a slight extension with ease, until it becomes level.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 But if the bone that is broken is large; then it is necessary that he place a very strong bandage.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it is necessary that he place the hand mold during its restoration, and the extended extension on top of the cushion.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint be lower than all the fingers or the rest; and let the patient sit erect on himself, and let the cushion be before him or directly opposite, at a height so that the patient does not undergo labor.  />  />
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then let the assistant extend the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another assistant should extend it similarly from above.  />  />  />
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then let the physician make the bone level until he returns it to the best shape that he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are splinters in the bone fracture, then strive to reduce every fragment to its place with your skill.  />  />  />  />  />  />
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 But if there appears a separate splinter that pricks the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it; then find it, and remove it according to the method that we have said concerning those things which are premised.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 But if the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a special chapter on that, therefore receive its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 But if a hot abscess happens at the beginning of your restoration, then line a cloth with an ointment made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be of medium thickness between thick and thin; and bind the cloth over it with a fine bandage, until the abscess subsides; then remove the ointment, and apply a prepared plaster made from millstone powder with egg white.  />  />  />  />  />  />
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place splints, and let the splint that is placed over the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in various arrangements: whether the fracture is in one joint or in two joints at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place your bandage over the fracture site more strongly and firmly, and somewhat more so with the bandage above or below the fracture: or place a softer bandage than the bandage itself for a little while, according to how its preceding mention began at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And let the cloths that are wound over the fracture be soft, moist; and not hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 And let the thread by which it is bound be made of linen, medium between fine and coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 And consider the limb and its ligaments after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something happens for which a correction is necessary, such as an itch that occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to soak the limb in warm water until that itching ceases, and leave the limb unbound until it ceases; then repeat the bandaging.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 But if the bandage has already been softened and the bone has already set and similar things: then correct that whole thing with your strength, and examine it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to an excess of bandaging, then it is necessary that you soften it a little and leave it alone for several days until nourishment reaches it; then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 But if none of the things that I have mentioned happen to the patient, then it is not necessary to loosen the bandage unless after twenty days or around this time.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then let the hand of the patient be suspended from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And its neck should be even and it should be protected by its strength from disturbing movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 All of this depends on the complexions and dispositions of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 ¶ On the restoration of hand fractures
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that in the bones of the hand and in the knuckles of the fingers, a fracture occurs rarely. 》
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 And it does not happen to them except from much rubbing. 》
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When therefore a fracture or attrition of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the sick person sit firmly; and before him let there be a seat according to his equality. 》 》 》 》
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand on top of it, stretched out.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then let the attendant straighten the broken bones, and may the physician make them even until they join together with a good union. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary that he place a plaster and wool, if a hot abscess does not occur. 》
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place a splint on top according to the size of the place; and you have already wrapped it in a linen cloth. 》 》
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 But if the fracture is below towards the sole of the foot, then make something similar to a sphere from cloth; and instruct the sick person to press on top of it with his broken sole; then let it be bound with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the splint be made of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather adheres to the body of the sole; and bind it as is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 But if the fracture is on the outside, then it is necessary that you place a splint on top and another splint from below at the sole; and let the hand be open and straight. 》
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then place the bandage as if turning a hand: and stretch it between the fingers with a ligature.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If there is a break in any of the finger joints, then if it is the thumb, it should be set right as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then bind it with a bandage: and if you wish, place on it a small straight splint so that the break may be lifted up and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 But if the break is in any of the other fingers, such as the middle finger, or index, ring or little finger, then it should be set and bound with the healthy finger which follows it; or they can all be bound together according to their sequence: and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Or place on it a small splint, as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And consider in your restoration and after the arrangement of a hot poultice: and apply with it what is necessary when something happens from that, according to the account of its occurrence.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 ¶ On the Restoration of a Hip Fracture
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The hipbone is often broken and this becomes obvious to the senses because it turns inward and toward the rear.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its restoration is done like this: a bandage is placed above the break, and another bandage below the break.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 And the patient is laid on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then let the assistant stretch each bandage to its part equally; and this is done when the break is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 But if the break is near the hip joint, then let one bandage be to the pubic region so that its extension goes upward; and another bandage below the break.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And similarly if the break is near the knee, then let one bandage be near the knee so that its extension goes downward. ›
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the physician should set the bone with both his hands until he brings it back into the likeness of its natural shape; and joins the bone in a good union. › ›
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then you should apply a plaster and bandage if there is no abscess in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If an abscess occurs in it, then leave it for a few days until the hot abscess settles, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 And its bandage should be like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 You should wrap over the fracture a thick bandage, that is, a bind; and fold it two or three times, so that there remains some extra length from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wrap the leg until it reaches the heel at the base of the big toe.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And introduce a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee on the inner side, so that the ends of the thread come out from the upper parts of both sides.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then wrap over the leg and hip what remains extra from the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place on the hip at the site of the fracture itself two sticks, and place from them one stick over the end of the leg.  \\
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill the spaces between the leg and the hip with soft cloths so that the bandage is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then begin with strong bandaging from the middle over the site of the fracture with three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And the more you extend with the bandage from the site of the fracture, let your bandaging be less and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then attend to the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Therefore tie three sticks with both ends above.  \\
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go with the two ends of the thread to the lower part until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And with both tie also the ends of the sticks from the other side, so that the bandage is not displaced from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then leave the bandage on it while it remains in place, so that there is no corruption of the limb, nor abscess, nor swelling, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 "If something happens from it.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 "Therefore hasten to dissolve it and correct the whole of what happened from it, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 "But if there is a fragment of bone that is causing pain: then it must be evened out, if possible.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 "And if not, smoothen over it and remove it; and take care of the preceding as mentioned until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 "And sometimes this hip fracture is set, besides which splints are added to it, as we have said in the case of the thigh and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 "However, when this type of fracture is reset, lameness does not occur to the weakened individual.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 "And if it is reset alone, without being attached to the other leg, then it is necessary that he who has it will always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 "And know that the hip is set in fifty days, or too little or too much is added; all of this depends on the diversity of constitutions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 "About the resetting of a broken kneecap.
Caput XVI.	 "Chapter Sixteen.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 "Know that the kneecap is rarely broken, but it is often subject to attrition.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 "If a break does occur, then only either a crack or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 "And this occurs with and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 "And it heals completely with sensitivity.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 "Its resetting is thus: that which has been broken from its parts is made even with the fingers, until it comes together and joins as possible by making even and facilitating the construction."  />
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 "Then place a poultice of sesame flour or milled grain with egg white on it; and if needed, place a round splint on top and bind it tightly above with a suitable bandage.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the conditions that we have described for other fractures, such as a hot abscess and similar things. Use what is appropriate to counter each incident until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 On the restoration of a thigh fracture.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that the thigh has two bones; one is thick and is called the femur, and the other is thin and is called the patella.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And it happens to both types of fracture that happen to the two bones of the arm; and because of this, its restoration is done equally and the procedure is the same as for the arm.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If both bones are broken at the same time, the thigh will turn in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 And if the thin bone is broken, the thigh will turn towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 And if the thick bone is broken, you will find it lower down; and this is one of those things that are not hidden from you. ・
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then apply traction, realignment, and ligament tying according to the same method as described earlier.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 However, if the thigh fracture is a foul break with many bone fragments, the traction should be less and more gently applied than in other cases. ・ ・
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 And in the case of the thigh, there is something additional in the procedure compared to the arm. When you have realigned the bone ends and completed all your work, then take two splints made from pine wood used for constructing sunshades that are placed under tiles, and they come from the palms of leaves; choose those with a small thickness and not too thin, and let their length be according to the length of the thigh from the knee downwards. ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・ ・
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then wrap each splint with two layers of cloth along its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other part on the opposite side: and they should be from the knee down to below the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then bind two bands in three places from both ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 For when constriction is prevented, the leg deviates to the right and left, and stands firmly in place.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And now let a cradle be prepared from wood according to the length of the leg, and the leg should be placed in it so that it may preserve the leg from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 And indeed, it is most important that you do this in a fracture when there is also a proper wound with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then examine the leg every day, and be diligent to avoid any swelling, inflammation, or other problems.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If, therefore, any of these things occur, then apply what is necessary until it heals, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes. ">
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter Eighteen.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 Indeed, a fracture does not happen to the heel at all.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 However, a fracture sometimes happens to the bones of the foot and toes, but it does not occur except by attrition in many ways. ">  />
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see those bones raised above each other, then let the patient place his foot on prepared earth as if he were walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand and place your foot on that which is raised among those bones; afterwards press or step on it: and make it level until it returns to its proper place.  />
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then apply a poultice and wool on top; and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then bind it with the foot with a decent bandage after you have wrapped it with cloth and other things it may need.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 When three days or four have passed for him, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find that the bones are equalized, whether they be broken or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 The procedure is thus as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 But if some fingers are broken, then set them right and equalize them according to what I have told you regarding the setting of the hand's fingers.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place the splint according to the length of the finger, and make it slightly wider. After that, place this board under the foot which I have told you about, and bind it with a fitting bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 But if the bones that are broken are two or three or more, then place a splint of its size on each finger, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board to the lower foot: and let it stand on one end of the board outside the stomach of the foot, so that it may hold well. 》
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 And it is fitting for you not to forget that you consider everything which I have said to you regarding other breaks from the accidents which we have mentioned, and apply all of this to every accident as necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 ¶ On the break of a woman's vulva, and the pubic bone, and a man's penis.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter 19
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's vulva is broken, then make her sit with her thighs spread apart.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then incline her slightly towards her back, and let her be held from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then the midwife should fill her vulva with cotton until it is full; and let this be done in the vulva as if making a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then let the woman be shaken, and gradually raise up her back.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For that cotton will exit, until it comes out at the entrance of the vulva like a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a little wool on its back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 And when it wishes to urinate, let it remove the catheter with ease, then urinate; and put it back according to the way you first inserted it; then return to its first wool.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Let him do that for seven days, or about that time, because the urethra is healed.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you wish, take the bladder of a sheep, and tie a reed over its opening, and insert the whole bladder into his vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow into the reed with force, until the bladder is inflated inside the vulva, for the fracture returns to its place.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then it will be filled with a catheter, and let it remain for several days, as we have said, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when the urethra of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and equilibrium that which we have said concerning the bone of an Anchorite.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And in these nearby fractures that touch only a little, especially for one who has some interest or use, the anus is not hidden.  />
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 And understand this book of mine well, because the fracture itself shows you in many cases the correct way for its own restoration and tightening; therefore, understand it.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 But when a man's penis is broken, take the throat of a goose and insert the penis into it.  />  />
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then wrap a bandage of cloth around it and let it remain for three days, or about that time, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 ¶ Concerning the restoration of a bone fracture when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is appropriate for someone who has experienced a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone or thigh bone, or something similar to them, that you hasten and bleed him immediately: if the conditions of bloodletting are shown to you, as we have said before.  />  />  />  />  />
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound bleeds, you should hasten to cut it, and powdered zegi should be applied onto it; if no other remedy is available to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin restoring the fracture on that same day, and do not delay it unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess settles.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach it on the third and fourth days, for you would cause bad things to happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 But if the broken bone is prominent and visible on the skin, then you should try to reduce it and equalize it with your hands, with little force and extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 But if its extension and equalization by hand are not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is seven or eight fingerbreadths, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And for this reason it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them according to what is needed for that treatment in every kind of fracture.  />
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And let it be round; and let there be a slight thickness in it, so that it does not bend during the operation, and let it have a sharp point at its end, with an edge on its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And let its upper part be thick from half of it to its lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 It is necessary in this operation that the sharp curved end of it be placed on the prominent end of the bone, and push it with one stroke until the bone returns and is equalized by some equality.  />  />
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Therefore try to equalize the ends of the fracture together.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grasp it well, then you should cut the end of that bone until the instrument can hold it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If you cannot reduce them with what we have described, then cut him with the appropriate scalpel from those which we have mentioned, or saw him with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then scrape away any roughness and small bone fragments remaining on the bone.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 When the bone is reduced and the patient experiences severe pain after its reduction, you should know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	 Do this then.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For you confer a great benefit on the patient when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then soak the cloth in strong, black wine.  />
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And properly, if it is summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 Do not place a greasy cloth, or anything with oil, on the wound, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption therein.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then give astels at the end of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And leave the wound open; do this by cutting a hole with scissors in the bandages according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 And take care not to bind the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For many times have foolish doctors done this and caused either death or corruption or pus, that is, purulent discharge, to befall their patients.  /> 
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And let your bandage be soft and gentle, different from the binding of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 But if the wound is bad or large and you fear that some of the harmful outcomes we have mentioned may happen, and you find pain in the area, then it is not proper to place astels on it.  />
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make bandages from hard cloths in the place of astels and bind the wound with them.  
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 But when it is the first or second day and you see that the wound begins to generate pus, then remove from it the cloth which you placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then administer liniments and ointments which we commonly use to treat wounds, such as the tetrapharmacum ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it is suitable for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 And examine the wound each morning and evening until it heals and consolidates.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 And it is necessary that the member be prepared in such a way that the pus runs downwards easily from it.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If many days pass and the wound does not heal nor does the pus burst from it, then know that there are small fragments of bone within it.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, it is necessary to probe the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 However many of those fragments are separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those which are not separated and pierce the member, causing pain, endeavor to cut them out and remove them by any means possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If the wound becomes inflamed or forms a carbuncle, that is, an estiomenos, or another sign of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary to apply to each of these what is suitable for them from the treatment, whose preceding description is in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And from this, it is necessary that my speech stands and to which you direct your attention when a bone is broken and protrudes over the member, such as the hip bone or thigh bone, and similar ones among the large members, it is that you should not attempt to reduce it, for death often results from this; rather, leave it alone until it becomes putrid.  />
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 For perhaps it will fall by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Then treat the wound if it seems necessary to you; otherwise, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 About the treatment of swelling at the site of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 This swelling often occurs as a result of healing a broken bone.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Especially if it is near the joints, and the limb becomes deformed because of this shape.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it prevents the limb from functioning naturally.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Therefore, if the swelling is recent, apply to it remedies that have an astringent effect, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, dragon's blood, and acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 In this way, take some or all of these and prepare them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and place them on the swelling in wool, and bind them tightly over it with a good bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And leave the bandage in place, and do not remove it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then remove it, and apply another one, until the swelling is removed. xspace
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or bind a lead sheet over it securely.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead has the property of removing anything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 But if the swelling has already turned into a hard lump, and is tightly bound and pressing urgently to be removed, then make an incision over it from above, and cut off the protruding excess; or shave it with some razors, until it is removed; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 ¶ On the treatment when the limb is restored but remains thin and not in accordance with its natural state.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When a bone fracture is restored but the limb remains thin and weak afterwards, this happens only for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 One of these reasons is the frequent loosening and re-tying of the bandage, not as it should be; or because of excessive tightness of the bandages, so that the nourishment cannot reach the limb; or because of an excess of ointments applied at the wrong time; or because of a lack of blood in the infirm body and its weakness.  />
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 And the treatment is to feed the patient and make their body soft until blood increases in them.
Et administra balneum.	 And apply a poultice.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 And pour joy and happiness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place pitch on the member, so that it draws much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 And continually use an infusion of warm water on it, until the nourishment runs, and it returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 ¶ On the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 When a member that has already been restored after its healing is crooked or protruding from the fractured bone or knotted, and its form is disfigured, yet the member does not prevent its natural operation, then you should not accept the advice of one who thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And indeed there have been many foolish physicians and restorers who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 And this operation is very blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, as if it were fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 However, if the limping and knottedness are recent, then it is necessary that an infusion be made with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as mullein leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar herbs.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And for him make a poultice with softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Or let the mucilage of the root of mullein be taken and shaken with chicken fat or sesame oil, and he should be poulticed with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Or let figs be taken, ground with pigeon dung and similar substances that are called in the medicine books as "consolidation reducers".
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes the knottedness is dissolved with constant, old, and gentle friction, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 And let motion be given to the limb towards every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 But if the twisted part has already preceded and has become hardened and turned into a bone, and the necessity for its treatment with iron has arisen; then it is necessary to cut above it, and free the continuity of the bone, and cut off what is in excess from the knotting or the bone with fine incisions: and let facility be given in that with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 About speech in dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its proper place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Therefore, it is prevented from its own motion and the shape of the limb is marred.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And it causes severe pains and injuries to come upon the weakened area.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 Therefore, when someone experiences a dislocation, it is necessary to hasten towards its restoration; do not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation as well.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Because of this, it is not necessary to move it or extend it during the hour of its inflammation. ›
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Since it often causes spasms and piercing pains to occur.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 But when this happens, then it is necessary to hasten towards the bloodletting of the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then let it be released until the inflammation subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then the limb should be rubbed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And all of the limb should be scraped along with it when it returns to its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, even following as it preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body to its lower parts.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 About the care of the dislocation of the lower jaw. › › › ›
Caput XXV.	 **Chapter 25.**
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 **The two jaws are rarely dislocated.**
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 **And the dislocation of both happens in one of two ways.**
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 **For either they are moved from their places by a small removal and soften slightly**
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 **Or they are dislocated completely until they soften at the chest, so that the sick person's saliva runs and cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue rolls with speech.**
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 **But when the dislocation is slight, then it returns on its own in most cases.**
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 **But if the dislocation is complete, then it is necessary to administer its reduction quickly and not at all delay: and it is that the attendant holds the head of the sick person, and the physician introduces the thumb of one hand between his teeth if the dislocation is on one side.**
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 **Or he introduces both thumbs at once if the dislocation is from both sides.**
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 **And the other fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he balances.**
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 **And tell the patient to clean his jaws and return them to their original state of biting.**
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 **And the physician balances the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.**
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 **If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are affected together, then apply a fomentation with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy; do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.**
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 **When they return and are balanced, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place small pieces of cloth soaked in wax and rose oil on them.**
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 **Then it should be bound gently with soft bandages.** xspace
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And let the patient's sleep be on his back: and his head should be supported between two pillows, so that he does not move to the right or left; neither should he attempt or be forced to chew anything; rather, let his food be given as a gentle drink until the pains are removed, and then the jaw should be tied. Then he may eat whatever he wants, and it should be administered easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 He shall not strain himself with the movement of his mouth for eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is tied and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 But if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some point and do not return to their proper places, then fevers and persistent swelling often occur from this, and perhaps the patient's bowels are loosened, and perhaps pure bile is vomited.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 Therefore, when you see this happen, know that it is fatal, and the patient often dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 ¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the end of the upper arm.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The collarbone indeed does not dislocate from within the ribs because of its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 And it sometimes dislocates to the outside and is evident by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 The treatment for this is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then firmly grasp the place with your hand, for it will return on its own.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then apply a plaster and pillows to it, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 However, the ends of the bone that follow the elbow and are continuous with it do not dislocate, except rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 But if it does dislocate on some day, then it must be reduced and set as we have said and as you have been prepared for.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place upon it a plaster, and small pills, and a bandage.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And instruct the patient to remain calm and still until healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And with this same treatment the dislocation of the shoulder is reduced when it has also been separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 § On the reduction of shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One of which is that it may be dislocated downwards to the armpit.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second way is that it may be dislocated towards the chest. 》
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it may be dislocated to the upper part of the shoulder; and this occurs rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 And it does not dislocate towards the back, due to the blade (of the scapula).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it does not dislocate forwards, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 Most often it dislocates and exits downwards towards the armpit; especially in those whose flesh is scant.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Because it exits quickly in them and re-enters quickly. 》 ⟩ ⟩
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of this, that is, because it exits with difficulty and re-enters with difficulty. 》 ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And it happens to some people that a blow or fall occurs and the shoulder swells up with a hot swelling, and it is thought because of this that it has already been dislocated. 》 ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, you should examine it until you stand on certainty about it, and then proceed with its treatment. 》 ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 And a dislocation is recognized when it is downwards towards the armpit; and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you will find between them a clear difference, and you will find in the head of the shoulder a hollow, and beneath the armpit where you feel the head of the shoulder it is as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all its motions. 》 ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you will find a clear touch, and it will not be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And in fact, this dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent, or if the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 And its reduction is that the assistant should lift his hand upward.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs under the joint, and lift the joint with strength upward to its place: and the assistant should lift his hand, and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then he should place it below, for it quickly returns by itself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 But if it does not return through that which we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation first occurred: then it is necessary that the sick person should bathe in hot water, and a poultice should be administered which softens and soothes, such as when hollyhock roots, fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and this is applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then the sick person should be placed on their back: and under the joint there should be placed a ball and wool, which should be of equal measure between softness and tightness. 
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the physician should place his heel on the ball, and lift the head of the humerus with strength, and draw the patient's hand downward.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another assistant should hold the patient's head so that it does not move downward; for it returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is that you should have present a man who is taller than the patient, and he should stand at the side of the patient, and insert his humerus under the joint of the patient; and he should lift the joint upward until the patient hangs in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another assistant should draw the patient's hand downward to his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 But if the patient is light; then it is necessary that something else should be suspended with him, so that he becomes heavy; for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And it is also reduced in another manner: and that is, as if a long stick is fixed in the ground, with its head being round like the handle of a mortar, which should not be too thick nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then let soft cloths be placed under the patient after he has been positioned on top of the stick's head, and the patient should stand along the length of the stick.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then his hand is extended downward on one side, and his body is extended strongly on the other side, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 But if his reduction is difficult by all the means mentioned above, then use this method: and that is, take a stick whose length is equal to the size of two arms, and its width the size of four fingers, and its thickness the size of two fingers. Its head should be round, so that it can easily enter deep into the armpit, in this manner.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then let soft cloths be tied over the round head, so that the stick does not hurt the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then let it be placed under the patient's armpit, so that his hand or arm may be extended over the stick down to the bottom; and let the stick be tied to a support, and the arm and the tip of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then let the arm be placed on the step of a ladder by its width, and the hand be extended downward, and let the rest of the body hang freely on the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 For the joint will go back immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 Therefore, when its entry is completed in whatever manner possible, it is necessary to place under the armpit a sphere of equal size made from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place a prepared plaster made from powdered flour with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder as it is wrapped around.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then tie a decent bandage under the armpit, and let the band be rolled over the plaster on top; and let his hand be bound to his neck, and do not move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 And it is necessary that food be given sparingly to the sick person until the wound heals, because it heals more quickly.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then let a larger amount of food be given after seven or five days, and let it be taken with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If it becomes firm and does not soften, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If, however, the joint is frequently dislocated, either because of the moisture that affects it or for another reason, then it is necessary to administer a cautery with three holes in it, as was mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 But if all this is done and the ligament is dissolved after seven days and the joint does not become firm and the plaster and bandage are removed from it several times and it does not become firm but falls and cannot be raised again, then know that the nerves connected to the head of the shoulder have already been cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never remain in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 But dislocation that occurs towards the chest and breast or towards the back is reduced with pushing and stretching by hand until it returns; then let the remaining plaster and care be administered to it until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 But if heaviness and slowness of movement occur in the limb after healing, then let the patient use the bath frequently until that heaviness is alleviated and returns to its original condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 ¶ On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty, and it can be dislocated in all directions, especially towards the front or back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And its dislocation will not be hidden from you, because it is obvious to sight and touch in whatever form it may be dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clearly shown to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 For the junction will be noticeable and the arm cannot be bent double nor can it touch its own shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And you must hasten to reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot swelling occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if a hot swelling occurs, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 For this is the worst of all types of dislocations and causes them the most intense pain; and death often follows it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And its restoration when it is possible to reduce it is that the patient's hand should be stretched out with two hands; and his arm should be extended, and the physician's hands should be above the elbow and below it, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of both his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place. 》
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or if the dislocation is towards the front, then it returns thus: that he bends his hand with his own hand until he strikes the dislocated elbow with the root of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 But if the dislocation does not obey reduction, then apply strong and very violent extension; and it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and two other assistants should hold him also, so that he may not move during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then the arm should be turned to every side after a long folded cloth or broad bandage has been wound around his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil; so that this may be one of those things which aid the lubricity of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then he should push the joint with a violent thrust until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 And after its reduction, a plaster should be placed on it, containing styptic and drying properties with egg white, and bound with a decent bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 And let the arm be suspended from the neck of the patient; and leave it for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then let it be released.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If then the joint is firmly established in its place, release the bandage from it and leave it alone.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see that the joint is not well fastened, then repeat the application of the poultice and the bandage, and leave it alone for some days, until it is fastened.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then release it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 But if after the reduction of the joint it becomes heavy and is in motion; then administer a moistening bath, a subtle friction, and a compression until it is straightened, or place on the joint iliati, that is, the fatty tail of a ram.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then let it be bound, and leave it on night and day.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it, and have the patient enter a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 When he sweats, then gently rub the joint with a moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then repeat the application of iliati three times: when entering the bath the first time, and the second, and the third, until it is relieved.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you wish, place on it warm, moist cow dung mixed with butter, and bandage over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 For it is soothed, and returns to its proper condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 § On the treatment of dislocation according to Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 The wrist is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 And its reduction is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 Unlike other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of this dislocation within the hour it occurs, before swelling sets in; or a hot inflammation arises in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 And the reduction of this dislocation is accomplished by placing the affected hand on a table, with an assistant stretching out the patient's hand; and the physician places his palm over the protruding joint, and pushes until it returns to its place. ➤
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 Indeed, it is necessary to consider whether the palm has already receded to the belly of the hand: then the sick person should place the back of his hand on the board for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is proceeding toward the back of the hand, then let his hand be placed intrinsically on the board, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the board, so that the hand of the physician may fall onto the very prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 Therefore, if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster to reduce the swelling, and leave it alone, do not irritate it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 For if he does not tolerate it, and you cannot reduce it after the days have passed, although the joint remains in its twisted state, and it causes no harm to the patient except that the hand becomes soft and cannot grasp anything, then know that the nerves are severed or damaged.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 Therefore, there is no skill in it except to cauterize it near its site.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps it does not help at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 When the Almahassem does not return, then apply to it the plaster that I have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then let it be bound and left for five days; afterward, let it be unbound and left, and the hand should be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 However, if its movement is impaired and something heavy happens to it, then soothe it with warm water and frequent rubbing until it is soothed. 
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 ¶ On the Treatment of Dislocated Fingers.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated in any direction, whether the finger is dislocated toward the back of the palm or its belly, then extend the finger and press on the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then support the head of the finger and hang it toward the side to which it is dislocated for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then suspend him and stretch him until he is straight on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When it is night, bind him according to the aforementioned account: and do not cease to release him during the day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do that for several days until it is tightened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And do likewise with him if his hand is dislocated towards the abdomen: and bind it to that part, and perform your first treatment on him until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And do likewise with him when he is dislocated in other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 ¶ On the treatment of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When the vertebrae of the back or neck are completely dislocated or many vertebrae are displaced from their places, then there is no cure for it, because death hastens to the invalid.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And the sign of it is that the invalid's bowels come out involuntarily and he cannot hold them in, and often some of his limbs become paralyzed, or both of his legs, or both of his arms, or one of them, or a single vertebra is displaced from its place. 
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 For often it happens that their removal occurs in four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 Therefore, that which is removed to the back is called "humpbackedness.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 Its cure is that you should consider then, if the humpbackedness occurred from childhood: then there is no cure for it, and there is absolutely no healing from it.   
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 But in that which occurs from an accident or blow, or similar things, the ancients have already spoken at length about methods of cure.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 Of which very little is accomplished with benefit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 But I have already abbreviated from that, and pardon me for saying this about the multitude of it from its propinquity to my intention and explanation which I have explained and formed an instrument in a different way than they showed and demonstrated it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 I say therefore that in the case of a hump which occurs from the front, there is no skill and no cure from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly in those which occur on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And they are not cured by this, except for those which occur on the back itself, as I describe: and it is that the patient is laid down on his face on a level platform near the wall; and under him wet straw is spread out, so that his chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then a straight stick is fixed in a hole in the ground at the end of the platform near his head; and another stick near his feet at the other end of the platform; and an assistant holds the stick, not firmly fixed in the hole.  />
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And another assistant holds the other one.  />
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then roll up above the patient's head and under his chin a soft but strong bandage; and extend the end of the bandage to the stick that is by his head; and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then bind another bandage above his ankles, and above his knees, and around his calves.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the bandages together and tie them to the other stick that is by his feet.  />  />
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then let each assistant extend their bandage towards the stick, and do not move the two sticks from their places where they are fixed; however, they should not be firmly attached, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the physician places his hands on the vertebrae with strength, until it returns; or he places a board on top of it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he connects his feet to the board until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 But if it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arm's lengths.  />
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And make an opening in the wall near which we said the patient is located, into which the end of the board can enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the midpoint of the board over the vertebra.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And let the physician place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And he should pull firmly until the vertebra is compressed, and then return to his position.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then, if you wish, work with a lathe that can be turned by hand: and there is, as you should fix into the ground at the head of the patient, on the last step of the platform, two pieces of wood, each of them the length of one arm; and at his head, on the last step of the platform, two more pieces of wood.  />
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And let the distance between each piece of wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in every place where the lathe runs; and let all the pieces of wood be firmly fixed in the ground, so that they do not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 And a round piece of wood is inserted; and this is the lathe on which the band is turned in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at its end is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is one palm with what is being turned; and on the two other pieces of wood it is likewise.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then tighten the bands that you have tightened on the patient's chest with the lathe that is at his head; and the bands that you have tightened on his legs with the lathe that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then let an assistant stand by each lathe, who turns the handle with which the lathe is turned; and the physician should adjust the vertebra as we have said.  />  />
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of the lathe that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then, after the vertebra has returned to its place and the position is adjusted, it is necessary to place a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then wool.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Afterwards, place on the plaster a board of three fingers' width, or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length should be sufficient to cover the swelling and extend onto the healthy part of the spleen.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then it is tied with the ligament we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And the patient should use a fine diet until healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If any swelling remains at the end of the healing process, then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medications along with the tablet we mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now a lead sheet is applied there.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 And sometimes swelling occurs in the last vertebra of the spine; it is believed to be a dislocation, and the bone that has already emerged is called an exostosis.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore, it should not be assumed to be treated with this medication; perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 § On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the shoulder do not undergo anything but dislocation; nothing happens to them as it does to other joints due to a slight separation and shallowness.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 The ankle joint is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 That is, because it is dislocated forward and backward.  /> In the case of a forward dislocation, you should bind the foot to the leg with one bandage in such a way that the ankle joint is pulled back by its edge and stays there.  /> Then place two splints on either side, binding them together with another bandage.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 And it is dislocated most often to the inside; less frequently to the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 And the treatment for its dislocation to the inside is this: when you join the healthy leg of the patient with the unhealthy one, the unhealthy one is longer; and its knee protrudes more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot double his foot at the groin; and the place following the groin is swollen with a warm swelling because the head of the thigh bone has already arrived there.  /> You should bind the healthy leg to the unhealthy one in such a way that you pull the unhealthy one back until it matches the healthy one in length; then apply splints on both sides and bind them together with another bandage, so that neither can move from its place.  /> Then take some lead plates or other metal and make two small discs from them. Place these discs between the swollen place and the groin, binding them together with a fourth bandage.  /> Afterwards, apply the plaster we mentioned earlier; and have the patient use a fine diet until healed.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 And the sign of that which has been dislocated outward is that its accidents are contrary to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 And the sign of that which has been dislocated forward is that it stretches the healthy leg fully: however, without pain in the knee; and if it tries to walk, it cannot step onto its toe; and its urine retention occurs, and a swelling appears in its groin, and during walking there is pressure on its heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 And the sign of that which has been dislocated backward is that it does not extend the knee, nor can it double itself before doubling the groin; and its leg is even shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and there is a protuberance at the site of the hip bone.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction, however, of these types of dislocations is such that you should consider, at that time, if the dislocation is old, which has already become chronic in the patient.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then, if you administer its reduction and it remains in its original state, then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, one should not make a presumption about it at all.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 However, in the case where the dislocation is recent and is from one of the four types of dislocations, then hasten to do this: roll the joint, extend it toward the inside and outside, and move it right and left; for perhaps it will return, and no other treatment will be needed.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong helper; and let him stretch the leg from below: either with his hands or with a ligament, which is tied above the knee on the leg; and another helper should extend his hand from above, so that he introduces his hands under its armpits.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then let him bind it with a soft ligament over the base of the hip, and let him hold the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And let its extension be either from the front part of the groin to the collarbone or from the back part to the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And let all these be done at once so that the patient is lifted with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 And this type of extension is one of four common types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 Therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then for each type I will say something about its specific treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 For the proper reduction of it when the dislocation is toward the inside, it is necessary that the patient be rolled over onto his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then he should place a bandage on the hip joint, between the head of the thigh bone and the place under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the collarbone.  />
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then another strong assistant should take his arms and reduce the prominent part of the dislocated hip with a vigorous outward extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now it has returned to its place.  />  />  />
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this type is easier than the other types of treatment for reducing this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 But if it is pushed outward and does not obey you at all with this type of treatment, then it is necessary to bind both feet of the patient together with a strong, soft bandage over the two heels and the two knees, and let each bandage be four finger-widths in length from its fellow. And let the infirm leg be extended by more than half of two finger-widths.  />
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then let the patient be suspended over the top of a beam in the house, and let its length from the ground be that of two arms.  />  />  />  />  />  />
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong youth to hold the head of the thigh bone, and let another youth be suspended with the patient; and let another youth push, holding the thigh bone strongly, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 When there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary for the patient to lie on a bench, as we have described for those with a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And let the bandage be tied around his leg and chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then let two wooden sticks be placed: one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then let an additional stick be placed in the middle of the bench, securely fastened. Let it be wrapped with damp cloths so that it does not harm the patient, and let it be between his thighs so that he is not drawn downwards when extended.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then let each assistant pull on their respective part, and the physician should balance the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If it then submits to being returned (to its place), it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place a board on top of it and press it down evenly, as we said for a hump.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, the patient should lie on his sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary for the patient's leg to be extended quickly; and this account applies similarly on a bench; and the physician should place his right hand over the patient's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then let him squeeze with the other hand, and with that squeezing place the (leg) extended downwards towards the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 And if the dislocation is to the back, then it should not be necessary for the patient to be extended downwards; rather, he should be raised up off the ground. Indeed, it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, as is also appropriate if his ankle is dislocated outwards, according to what we said about lying on two ankles: and it is face-up with the bandages extended, as we recently stated. (){0}
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 And a bandage with a board should also be applied to the place from which the joint is dislocated when the reduction is completed as necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: It is that you extend the two legs of the patient and when you see them equal, and the patient draws up his leg and extends it without hesitation, then know that the limb has already returned as it should; then join the two hips and place a bandage, and bind with emplastrum, that is, a wheel, so that the ankle does not move towards any part; and let the patient rest quietly for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then loose the binding and bandage, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in position, know that the dislocation is now healed; therefore release the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see any swelling, then return and bandage it again, and bind it according to your first binding; and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then loose it and let the patient walk slowly on both legs for some days until it heals well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 About dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated to the outer side, to the inner side, and to the lower side, that is, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 And the sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to apply his leg to his hip.  ///
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 If it does not stick to the hip, then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the reduction of all kinds of its dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright so that he extends his leg over it if he can, and let your back stick to his face; and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then make the knee stick with your palms, and place them straight between your fingers on the knee.  ///  ///  ///
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply both sides of his knee with your palm strongly.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And another assistant should extend the foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 And the sign of reduction is that the leg adheres gently to the hip, not forcefully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then bandage it, and make the leg adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind them together with a band for three days or four.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then release them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And the patient should not walk for some days until he is cured.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 But if the reduction is refused, then apply strong traction with bands as described earlier for the treatment of ankylosis until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 § On the treatment of dislocation of the heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 40.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The heel is sometimes displaced by a slight separation and sometimes completely dislocated.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 And its dislocation occurs either towards the inside or the outside. ›
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and protruding towards the side to which it has dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 The treatment of its slight separation is easy reduction: and that is to stretch it gently with the hands until it returns to its place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 But the treatment of its complete dislocation is as follows: make the patient sit upright, and have a strong assistant hold him firmly from behind his back, in the middle of it. › › › › › › ›
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold the foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below in the place of the heel.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand. › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › › ›
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 "Then with the left hand two times.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 "Then extend with the left hand and press the top of the foot with the right hand towards the leg without difficulty.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 "Do that twice, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 "Then press the top of the foot towards the leg a third time, and you draw out the thread.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 "If then it returns once or twice according to this method, and you see the foot even, it is good; and if not, then repeat the procedure on him, for he will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 "However, if its reduction is prevented from you according to what we have described, then make the sick person lie on their back on the ground, and drive a peg into the ground firmly so that it falls between his thighs; and now you wrap a cloth around him so that the sick person is not harmed.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 "Then let the assistant take his thigh; afterwards the assistant should stretch out the other foot, either with his own hands or with a band that binds around the ankle of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 "Then let every assistant stretch in the opposite direction to their counterpart; and a peg should stand between the two thighs of the sick person, holding him so that his body is not drawn downward during the stretching.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 "Then let the doctor equalize the dislocation with his hands, and the other assistant should hold the healthy leg downward.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 "For the dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 "When the dislocation returns and its soundness is clear to you, then place a poultice and wool on it, and bind it securely with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 "And it is necessary that you be cautious or afraid of the nerves that are above the posterior heel, so that there is not a bandage over them that is too strong and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 "Then let him go for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the ligament is softened, tie it; then untie it on the third or fourth day, and prevent the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 If however he tries to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not dissolve over him and become corrupted, and that it will not afterwards receive healing.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If a hot abscess occurs to him, then you should administer for its relief that which we have previously described in another place for treatment, and an embrocation, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that what is dislocated among them be set right with only a little extension and without difficulty; indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 If however the dislocation is in certain nodes of the back of the foot, then it is necessary that the patient sit with his foot on a level surface or on a board, and stand as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you should stand and place your foot over that which protrudes from those joints. 》
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then press it firmly with your foot until it returns and you see that it is already set right, and no prominence appears in the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then place under his foot a board that fits the entire foot, which has two handles.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then bind it with a decent bandage for three days. 》 》 》
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then unbind it and make him rest from walking many days until he is bound and secured from relapse.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 Concerning the kinds of dislocations with a wound or a fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When such a thing happens and you seek to treat it and restore it, death often occurs; and for this reason one should not presume to undertake the treatment of such a case unless he is skilled in the art, long-practiced, merciful, pious, slow, not rash or presumptuous; and he should use at the beginning only those medicines that quiet hot abscesses, and leave the patient to divine judgment. 》 》 》 》 》
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 If you see or hope for health to be saved from ruin with gentleness of illness, and in which some hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Therefore, strive immediately at the beginning of the matter for its reduction before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If therefore the limb returns as we wish, then administer a remedy that settles the abscess, and treat the wound with an appropriate drying ointment.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 But if the dislocation is with fracture, and separate pieces of bone occur, then strive for their removal, and do as we said earlier in simple illnesses about what should be done in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And beware according to your strength, and guard yourself from entering the way of fear, as my earlier preaching to you said.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and safer for your body among them in your time.
