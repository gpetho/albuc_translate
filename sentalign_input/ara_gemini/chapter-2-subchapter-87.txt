Chapter eighty-seven on the amputation of limbs and sawing of bones
The extremities may rot, either from an external cause or from an internal cause.
If you treat this corruption with medical treatment and the treatment does not succeed, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing stopping it, then it is necessary to amputate that limb to the point where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved thereby from death or from a great affliction that is greater than the loss of the limb.
And the sign of whoever is afflicted with this is that the limb blackens until you think that fire has burned it, or it rots after blackening until that rot spreads to what is next to that limb and takes over the whole body, so hasten to amputate it.
And likewise, if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of some vermin, such as a sea scorpion, a viper, a tarantula, and the like.
If the corruption or the sting is at the tip of the finger, then amputate the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.
And likewise, if it has taken hold in the hand, then amputate it from the base of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it takes hold in both bones of the forearm.
And likewise, if it has taken hold in the forearm, then amputate the forearm at the elbow in the joint itself.
If the corruption has passed and you see that it has taken hold towards the shoulder, then do not amputate the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient, and use other treatment according to the ability.
And likewise you do with the foot if the corruption has taken hold in the toe, then amputate the toe at one of the phalanges.
And if it has taken hold in the metatarsal of the foot, then amputate the entire foot.
If it has ascended to the knee, then amputate the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, then there is no recourse but to leave it and surrender the patient to death.
The method of amputating or dissecting the limb is to tie a bandage at the bottom of the place you want to amputate and tie another bandage above the place, and an assistant stretches one bandage downwards and another assistant stretches the upper bandage upwards, and you strip the flesh between the two bandages with a wide scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then it is cut or dissected.
And it is necessary to place linen rags on all sides so that the saw does not touch the healthy area, causing the patient additional pain and a hot swelling.
If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the area quickly or apply some blood-stopping powders, then return to your treatment until you are finished, then bandage the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals.
And I will tell you an example of a man who suffered in his leg this very same condition that I am describing to you, and that is that blackness occurred in his leg with a burning sensation resembling fire, and that corruption first occurred in his toe until it took over the entire foot, so the man, on his own initiative, when he saw the corruption spreading in the limb, with the intensity of the pain and burning he was experiencing, amputated it at the joint and recovered.
Then, after a long time had passed, this same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand, so he came to me and I tried to stop that excess with the medicines I applied to the hand after cleaning his body, but the excess was not deterred and it began to spread to the other finger until the corruption took hold in the hand, so he called on me to amputate his hand, but I refused him, hoping to stop that excess and also fearing death for him if his hand were amputated, because the man's strength was failing.
So when he despaired of me, he returned to his town, and I heard about him that he, on his own initiative, amputated his entire hand and recovered.
I have only told this story to be a help in what occurs of this type of disease and to be a guide to be followed and acted upon.
