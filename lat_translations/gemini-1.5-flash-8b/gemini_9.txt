Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	Having completed this book for you, my children, which is the last of the knowledge in medicine with its completion, and having reached its end in its expositions and its declarations, it seemed to me to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the practice, that is, of surgery, with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since the practice of surgery has been neglected in our region and our time, entirely private, until perhaps its knowledge perished, and its trace was severed; and nothing remained of it but small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been altered by hands, and errors and hesitations have befallen them, until its purposes were closed and its effectiveness diminished: It seemed to me to revive it by the arrangement of this treatise, according to the manner of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and to present the forms of cautery instruments and other surgical instruments, with the addition of explanations and the acceleration of necessary procedures.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good practitioner of surgery with his hand is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is long, and its author must be trained beforehand in the knowledge of anatomy, as Galen described it, until he knows the aids of the limbs, and their forms, and their connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, tendons, and their number and exit points, and of the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their exits.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And therefore Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with a work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	However, we have already spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said concerning anatomy cannot avoid falling into error, whereby people are killed; as I have seen many of those who boast about this knowledge without understanding or experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	This is because I saw a foolish physician cut a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and cut some arteries in her neck; therefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician who presumed to remove a stone from an old man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore, he reached it and pulled it out with a piece of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore, the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And indeed I had already been called to remove it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the sick man that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land for medicine, and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician, in his ignorance, hurried and bound the fracture over the wound with pillows and small splints with strong binding, and did not allow the wound an outlet.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he discharged him according to his own desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards, he sent him away after a few days, and ordered him not to loosen the binding: and it remained like that until his leg and foot became abscessed and resulted in his destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called to him, and I hurried to loosen the binding, and there followed peace, and he escaped his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already become established in the limb, and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, the corruption ceased to spread in the limb until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician, who pierced the cancerous abscess: and it ulcerated after days, until his illness worsened with its master.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	This is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron at all, unless it be in a limb that can tolerate its being completely severed.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And therefore, children, it is necessary for you to know that surgery is divided into two divisions: namely, surgery with which health is associated; and surgery with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already brought forth in every place of this book, in which surgery comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of it and to diminish it, so that fools may not find a way to speak ill of it and disgrace it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, accept the measure with care and protection, and your sick ones with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to health and praiseworthy success: and leave the terrible illnesses of difficult cure: and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon your faith and your benefit.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your possessions.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad doctor.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Concerning the cautery with fire, and cautery with sharp medicine, epitomized and arranged from head to foot, and concerning the forms of instruments, and the implements of the cautery, and everything necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Concerning incision and perforation, phlebotomy and cupping, and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and similar things: and all epitomized, arranged by the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things: epitomized, arranged from head to foot, and concerning the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	Albucasis's Book of Surgery.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Concerning the benefit and harm of the cautery, and for what temperaments it is suitable, and at what time; and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is to be used.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the discussion of the quality of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discourse, a science and hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Many wise men have spoken on this subject, and disagreed on it; and for my part, a little of their words is sufficient, fearing prolixity.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that the cautery benefits every temperament, whether with matter or without matter, except for the two temperaments which are hot without matter, and dry without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, they disagreed in hot and dry temperament with matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that the cautery is helpful in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite, namely that the cautery is not suitable in an illness resulting from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat, and it is unsuitable that one be healed from a hot and dry illness with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite stated that through the cautery a benefit is achieved in every hot and dry illness that happens in human bodies, because when you compare a human body and its humors to the temperament of fire, you find the human body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say through his statement: because by experience it has already revealed that to me several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it is not fitting that one come upon it, unless one who is already proven and practiced in the final exercise of the cautery chapter, and has known the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the length of their time.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	However, from the remaining complexions there is no fear for you; and especially in cold and humid illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For already all physicians have agreed upon them, and have not disagreed in the benefit of cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, children, that from the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is this: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach, except the member that is cauterized; and it does not harm another member joined to it, except with little harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the members; and perhaps it causes illness of difficult healing to occur in the member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	However, that has now become known to us through experiment, because of the length of servitude and study with the art, and standing on the truth of things; and because of that I am excused from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would bring to you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies of its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses by a demonstrative philosophical discourse, which would be sharpened by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, children, that they disagree about the time in which the cauterization should be performed, and they place a better time in the spring.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is suitable at all times, because the harm that is incidental due to the time is submerged in the benefit that is drawn with the cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cauterization is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay, because it is feared from them that a greater evil will happen than the small harm which occurs due to the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not fall into your minds, O children, that which the common people and foolish physicians do not fear, namely that the illness cured by cauterization does not always return.  They consider that a consequence, but it is not as they think; because cauterization is not, unless in place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries the humidity which is the cause of why the pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization is superior to medicine in its swiftness of health, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion.  And it is possible for the illness to return at some time according to the complexion of the sick person, and the location of their illness, and its power, and that which is prepared in their body from the aggregation of superfluities in it, and that which comes to them in its acquisition from food, and similar causes, unless it is the illness for which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in a limb from few superfluities and humidities, like a toothache, because of the pain, and similar to it, it is possible that that pain will not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But truly the common people's saying, that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is a true statement; not in the way they intend it, however, because they believe it is not a cure that compares with medicine, nor with anything after the cauterization has passed.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	However, the reality is the opposite of that, and the intention that cauterization is the last resort of medicine is not, except when we administer methods of cure in some illnesses, and those medicines do not help; then we administer cauterization at the end of the matter, and it helps.  Then it follows that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention understood by the common people and many ignorant doctors.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	However, the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they did not say that except because of the equal nature of gold and the excellence of its substance, and they said that the area of the cauterization does not produce pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely true, because I have already tested it, and found that it does not do so in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization with it [gold] is good, and better than with iron, just as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you cauterize with gold in fire, it is not clear to you when it is heated according to the amount you desire, because of the redness of the gold; and when it quickly cools, and if you add further heat to it, it melts in the fire and changes into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the artisan falls from that occupation, and because of that cauterization with iron is faster and more readily available to us, in terms of suitability for the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And indeed I have already ordered this chapter on cauterization, according to chapters, and have arranged them from head to foot, so that they will alleviate the one seeking what he wishes from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization contributes to the dominion of moisture and coldness upon the brain; these two are the causes of headaches, and of a multitude of flows of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and of a multitude of sleep, and toothache, and sore throat; and universally of every illness which arises from coldness, such as paralysis, and headaches, epilepsies, and apoplexies, and similar illnesses to those.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is that you should instruct the sick person to be evacuated first with a cleansing laxative medicine, cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to what the sick person's strength, age, and custom require.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands in a square position, so that he has already placed his hands upon his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever, therefore, your middle finger shall reach, mark that place with the cautery.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the olive-shaped cautery to the fire.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it upon the place marked with the cautery, descending, so that your hand is gradually constricted, and you will revolve it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift your hand and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see now exposed from the bone a quantity of alkiel, or a quantity of zeuherbi, then raise your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from it if it cools: until the bones, which I said to you, are seen.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cotum in it, and place it over the place, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the soaked cotum on butter, and leave it over the place, until the eschar of the fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	Now they have said that the more a wound remains open, the more it discharges pus: therefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then that which has been burned from the bone should be scraped away, then treated.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to reach the utmost with the cautery, until it makes a deep impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, which happens like a kirate shape: or a tool that women use to prick the small alphabet; and they believe that vapors of the head are expelled from this place, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated until it is healed.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	However, these two kinds of cautery do not seem to me to be at all useful except in certain people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with the health of the patient.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have testified in other limbs; and especially when the head of the sick person is naturally weak.  And indeed the first kind of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore operate with it for the health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the entire head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs in the whole head and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses leeches, and cupping, and head purges, and oils, and poultices.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with the single cautery, which we have described, and none of those things helps it: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and encounters violent cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly below the first.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize the entire area above each horn of his head with a cautery, however, do not penetrate the skin and expose a quantity of bone, as we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize the area on the back of his head, in the location called the *vas*—and it is the place where the cupping vessel is placed—and elevate your cautery there; and do not expose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the sick person will experience intense pain due to that, differing from the pain of the other cauterizations on the entire head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will say this cautery should be in its place: and it should be a cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head with a finer cautery, than that which cauterizes the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with a burning medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is relieved by medicines that cleanse the head, and the remaining treatment, which I have described in the divisions of illnesses, is not effective, then cauterization is appropriate in two ways: either cauterization with a burning, sharp medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cautery with a burning, sharp medicine is as follows: take one clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then, incise the site of the pain with a broad lancet until a space is made beneath the skin, into which the clove is placed.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it into the space beneath the skin until it is hidden.  Then tie over it with a suitable constriction of a bandage, and leave it for fifteen hours, then remove it and extract the garlic.  Leave the wound for two or three days, then apply a poultice soaked in butter until the site produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	However, its cauterization with iron is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The cautery iron, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a nail, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in its middle is a small protuberance.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it upon the place, and hold your hand; and you should turn the iron slowly with speed; and let the quantity that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, like half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And lift your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak a poultice in salt water, and place it upon the place, and leave it for three days; then place the poultice with butter; afterward, treat with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife-edge.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of incision of the artery in this hemicrania, not properly ancient.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in an ancient hemicrania.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When treating hemicrania, using what we have said in the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and if the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that what we have said regarding the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery's knife-edge until it whitens, after having marked the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or something similar; and place your hand in one place, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to burn the jawbone, which moves during chewing, or the nerve that moves it, lest a spasm result.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard, and cautious about the flow of blood from the severed artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its severance there is fear, especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not studious or experienced; and he abandons the operation at the start.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with a reminder of the regulation of blood flow arising from the artery in its manner and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If, however, you see from the sickness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick man tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have recounted, treat the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cautery, which we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	Concerning the method of cauterization in earache.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When earache occurs due to cold, and is treated with solvents, and the remaining treatment which we have described in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and that is what is called the Point, whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then, after its ignition, apply the points along the circumference of the entire ear, as it revolves; or along the circumference of each ear, if the pain is in both simultaneously.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And move the cautery slightly away from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with ink; and let the amount of cautery be ten points on each ear, and like that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the places until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a Torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture that is treated with cauterization is only from those species that arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cauterization of the species that arises from desiccation and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this species of torture with enemas, and head-cleansings, and gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the afflicted person with three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, and a second a little lower from its temple, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery opposite the afflicted part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the tip of the upper ear, just beneath the horn of the head; and another in the temple, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type from a knife, whose form is previously described; however, it is not a little finer than that, as you see; and it is necessary that the knife have a little excess of thickness in it.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the places, with what preceded, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy is longstanding, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries upon each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what preceded: and let the method of the cautery be according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also, he is cauterized with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and it is more of a last resort.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then, let him be treated with what preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Concerning the method of cauterization in forgetfulness.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that large hyerae and pills that cleanse the brain be given to the sick person first, in their drink.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on the back of his head a plaster of the type described in the treatise on plasters concerning sinapis; and apply it repeatedly.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For that is the method of the cautery; and do it according to the same order as I stated there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore it heals by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye; and place the thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cautery with what preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish an addition, and the sick person is weak in tolerating it, then make a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If however you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat him until he is healed; and let the cautery be oily according to the form which was stated previously.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis, and softening.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person; afterward cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over each horn of the head, and with a cautery over its back, and with three over the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	However, if in the illness there is need for softening the body with more of these, and the sick person is tolerant, and the illness is severe, then cauterize him with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery, until most of it is burned from the skin, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then treat him until he is healed; and thus the cautery of Oliuare.

Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the rest of the treatment that we have described in the division: when the sick person is strong, or is tolerant in receiving medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If however, it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing mastications for the brain are administered, many days prior to that, with the improvement of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterward cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner: and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery on each horn of his head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	If, however, the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I described in the case of paralysis, and soften the body over the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the method that preceded.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is excess of the downward inclination to melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him a drink that will purify his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the patient's head, and afterwards make a neatly fashioned roll of linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head, and the patient, sitting upright, must be held secure on all sides.

Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if the descent of water is beginning in both eyes simultaneously; or from one side, if the beginning of water is in one eye; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin; and let the cauteries be long in the width of the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything from it, then cut it immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and caution from the flow of blood.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are ancient, constant; and are upon the veins and arteries that are in the manifest exterior of the head, it is verified that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery that I have described in the beginning of descending water, with a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck under the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if it needs addition, then cauterize it on every side of the cavity of the eye, above the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on every part; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not bring your hand with the cautery to the limit, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is to be burned.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid with hairs reversed, stinging the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery is in it according to two methods: either cautery with fire, or cautery with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In cautery with fire, beforehand tell the sick person to remove his hairs, if he is one of those who cleanses them, until they are elongated and equalized.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, they prick him at their origin, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they are born and equalized, then place the sick person's head in your lap; then mark above the eyelids of his eyes with ink, a mark which is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be close to the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a cloth soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply a cautery, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape that you have marked, gradually in many stages, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned away.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is, that if you see the eyelid now contracting, and the hairs rising at the puncture of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place on it a compress with butter, until the eschar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any hair grows back after an hour, and the eyelid softens: then again cauterize that place, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If however the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it, until it is raised to its natural place, and made even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is that you should instruct the sick person to let the hairs be, until they lengthen and become even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper and cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap, and from unsoaked lime, each one a weight of one ounce, or approximately that: then grind them together thoroughly, and do that quickly, so that it does not cool down.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then, spread some of it from the paste onto the paper you have made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid of one or two eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a cloth soaked in egg white: and let the head of the sick person be in your bosom.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a little while.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the medicine's bite, because its bite is found to be like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While, therefore, this that he finds, the bite, lasts, then release the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the bite ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider, if you see the eyelid raise, as it raises with a contraction from fire, or with an incision, it is well; and if not, then again put some medicine onto the place where the medicine does not take effect, and does not darken, until your operation is equalized, and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then place on it Cotum with butter, until the skin of the burn is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you during the operation to maintain the utmost care, so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after days, and something from the hair fights its way into the eye, then apply medicine again to the place on the eyelid that is softening, as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	And this is the form of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be; and the way of rectitude is not hidden from him who is diligent in this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	Concerning the method of cauterization in a tear duct fistula.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	When you treat a fistula, in the same way as we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then, it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Command the sick person to place his head in your lap, and let the attendant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a cautery, soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage, over his eye; then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish, it may extend penetratingly to the other end, and if you wish, it may be held upward in this way.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with the cautery near the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand does not wander or the sick person is not disturbed; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you reach in the beginning of your cautery's application up to the bone, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then place a cloth with butter, and care for it with a drying ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If forty days have passed and it is not healed, then place upon it a sharp, corrosive medicine, until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to what is coming in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first [authors] said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Direct your attention to the location of the fistula, and split it open; then place in the fissure a fine camahan, that is, a fine cannula, whose shape is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a drachma of melted lead, and hold your hand with the cannula firmly, and let the sick person not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run, or reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place over the sick person's eye a poultice steeped in egg white, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the area of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is healed by what we have said concerning the cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal passage, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what will come to its own proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in lip fissures.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Often fissures occur in the lip, called hairs, and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you treat these fissures, with what we have said in the division of illnesses, and if treatment does not help, then cauterize with a small knife cautery, according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then quickly place it, heated, on the fissures themselves, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a cautery, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	Concerning the method of cauterization in a fistula of the mouth.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth; then it produces pus, and bursts; afterward it becomes chronic, and pus flows, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and treatment is of no avail, then it is necessary to cauterize the fistula with a cautery of a size that matches it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then introduce the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its depth and its end; do this once, or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterwards, with what we have said about treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If, therefore, the pus is cut off and healed, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will be found in its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum softens because of moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then, with fire, a cautery, whose form will come after this, so that you place the Cannula over the tooth: and quickly insert into it the heated Cautery: and hold your hand for a little while, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire already reaching the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And raise your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to what you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the sick person fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour, and spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	For the moved tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Concerning the method of cauterizing toothache.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is due to cold, either the tooth itself is cold, or there is a worm, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the cautery is applied to it in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	However, cautery with butter is as follows: take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a pan.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cotton swab and wrap it around the tip of the probe.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse it in the boiled butter and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat it several times, until the fire's effect reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, and place a heated iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the deep cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	Its cauterization with fire is as follows: apply a brass or iron cannula.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of its thickness in its body so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then take a cautery, whose form will be shown, and place it on that tooth, and hold your hand until the cautery cools down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary, in the application of that cautery, that the sick person fill their mouth with good butter and hold it for one hour; then let them spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever extremity of force is possible; and this is the form of the cannula.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Strophulus.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When Strophulus are from phlegm and from cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and force hastens their digestion, then with a concave cautery of fire, whose form is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, so that smoke may escape from the cautery at one extremity; and place it ignited upon the abscess once, and a second time, if need be, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice infused in butter, until that which the fire burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with tooth ointment, until the form of the cannula is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	Concerning the method of cauterization in hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	When moistures overcome the lung passage, and especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary that the infirm person be evacuated first with dissolving medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it at the root of the throat in the depressed place, and beware, lest you reach the throat with the cauter, nor the skin, unless something of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cauter at the junction of the neck at the last vertebra of it, finishing: and let the cauter be narrow according to the manner which preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	Concerning the method of cauterization in diseases of the lung, and cough.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When cough and disease of the lung are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have fever, nor consumption, and the disease is old, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in low, smooth, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be of a tube according to the form that preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if you wish your cauterization to be by puncturing with a cautery, called Point, whose form preceded in puncturing the pain of the ears: and let the punctures be from thirty points up to as many more.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore, the cauterization will be alleviated when you do it with three cauteries at one time.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	Concerning the method of cauterization in the titillico, in the dislocation of the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the assisting cause of humidities is dislocated, and is not fixed at the time of its return from its dislocation, until such time as it is accustomed to returning, then it is dislocated by a slight movement, which happens as we have already testified it, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the sick person shall be placed on their back, or on their healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then raise the skin that is in the inner titillico upwards with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then taking a cautery with two prongs.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will be with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes a cauterization is made with a cautery having three prongs, therefore the shape of the cauterization is then six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the thread.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the shape of the cautery having three prongs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added to this shape, therefore there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place crushed leeks with salt on the cautery.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then cause the infirm person to adhere to stillness, so that the limb is not moved at any time until it is strengthened.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upwards, and that rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a hooked cautery, or with many cauteries by pricking.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the infirm person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When there are cold and many moistures in the stomach, until they extract it from its complexion, and the catarrhs multiply in it, and frequent modes of treatment, and do not benefit: then it is necessary that the infirm person be laid on their back, and extend their legs, and their hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery beneath the spoon-shaped region of the chest, a finger's breadth in size, with a cautery like a nail, and two cauteries below from two sides of the single cautery, until the shape of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen between each so that they do not join, when they will make pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cautery should be the amount of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form, without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach, according to this form, let the cautery by which this is done be single, in the form of a circle, according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by pricking him who is terrified by this cautery; and it is, as if signs on the stomach a point according to the amount, which you wish with ink; then cauterize it with the cautery of the point; then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	Of the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain occurs in the liver from coldness and moisture, or from thick windiness, until it emerges from its natural complexion by superfluous discharge, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the sick person be placed supine on his neck, and mark with ink three cauteries according to this figure, and this same amount, on the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the human elbow reaches; and let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand with the cautery much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the amount of what is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, the amount of half of it, not added; and let the sick person be standing on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If however, he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is possible for you, to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And guard yourself, so that you do not proceed to the utmost in cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, wherefore the whole body is burned, and reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an issue occurs, and you wish to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person is afflicted by pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is intense sharpness with the pain: and you already see that the treatment has fatigued its physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, it is necessary that the sick person lie on their back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then mark the location of the abscess with ink; then apply a cautery heated like a sunbeam.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it one cautery, until the whole skin is burned and it reaches the pus, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for issues, until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary for one to use this type of cautery unless one's study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and through whose hands such illnesses have come together with experience several times; then indeed let one dare to undertake such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But truly, to leave it is better, in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Pleuritis.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that cautery with aristolochia roots is for cold pleurisy according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you take from the dry long aristolochia roots, one root longer than the others, and of the thickness of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil, and light it in fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the fork with the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly sloping downwards to the part below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backwards; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from behind: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you should not press your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be evident by smelling the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient ones have said that there are people who use a cautery of iron similar to a rod; and they burn, and introduce it into that which is between the ribs, until they reach with it the abscess itself, and the pus comes out; as we have said regarding the abscess of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear, that either the weak person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the Spleen, Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat the illness of the spleen, with what we have said regarding the treatment in the division of illnesses, and if your treatment does not help, then the cautery is used in it according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is to make three cauteries, or four, drawing lines along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauteries of the liver, of which the figure preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between each cautery a quantity equal to the thickness of a finger, or a little more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of the cautery be, which we said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the infirm person lie supine on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is: that you heat the cautery having two points, which we said in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus: and raise the skin, which is in a direct line with the spleen, where the left elbow of the infirm person reaches: and let your lifting be such that you lift the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two very hot points, until with them you penetrate the skin on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; thus, four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three points.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then treat the cautery after you have dismissed it to emit pus for many days: for it is more beneficial than any of the preceding cures.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Concerning the method of cauterization in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall on dropsy, unless properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment is not effective, then you must cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, and another on the liver, and one on the spleen, and with two cauteries after the back between the vertebrae, and one in the direct line of the chest, and another in the direct line of the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be approximately equal to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery open, that it may discharge pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the sick person from treatment after the cautery with him; because it is necessary that two intentions be gathered in him; and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be a nail, according to its previous shape; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previous shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-four.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When boils fester in a dropsy patient, and are filled with yellow water, you should cauterize on the back of the foot, in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and annular areas; and raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand; and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be with the sharp end of the cautery; and let the cautery be along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg; and make two cauteries on each thigh; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may sweat out from it; then treat it with the rest of what we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in abdominal ailment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the abdominal ailment is from cold and dampness, weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated by methods of cure but does not heal; and you see the sick person tolerating a cautery of exuberant strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, as was previously done in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery, and four small cauteries around the navel, with a small claw-like cautery; and a large cautery on the lower back, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moisture, and the sick person tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the ribs, and a cautery on each hip; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is a beneficial cure, whose aid does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted moisture, and they are treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower spinal column of the back, under the almeidati somewhat triangularly, and a cautery under the navel, as if by two fingers' width.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming pustular, then cauterize him on his stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and cauterize on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a clauili cautery: and leave the cautery open for a time: then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise althelul, then cauterize with a cautery that resembles a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert it [the heated cautery] into the excised althelul: and with the last of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein, from which blood flows: do this once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with the cautery according to what we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what benefits them from the ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over alcatin, it is more beneficial in the end.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the patient does not obey the incision and the operation that we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is healed with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula occurs to someone, and becomes chronic, pus runs from it, and corrupt humours.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is more fitting that you probe it with a slender probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then ascertain its depth with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce the heated cautery into the fistula itself, and note the quantity in which the cautery entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these locations.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy location and you judge it not to be penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then treat the location until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If however the location is sealed, and the materials are cut away from it, and it remains like this for a long time, then know that it is now healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if they do not cut away the materials from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupt bone is in its depth, or something like that from those things; whose mention will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the Kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter Thirty-Nine.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from strong wind, and it diminishes thereby the strength of the afflicted person, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the almethen, above the kidneys themselves, with a cautery on every kidney with a nail cautery, whose mention preceded.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time on the almeidatu itself.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore three lines will appear.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore the latter will be more helpful.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening of the bladder occur from cold and moisture, so that the afflicted person cannot retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic region begin.  Cauterize from the right side of the summit, and from the left side of it, and let the length of the cauterization on either side be according to the size of a thumb's breadth. And cauterize it with a cautery from the lower back, or with two cauteries if you need them, and let it be according to the previous cautery's closure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture affect the uterus, hindering impregnation, corrupting her menstrual flow, delaying its discharge, and causing pain during its arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in cauterizing the bladder, and with a cautery above the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be closed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When mucous humours discharge into the anus and cause its exit from its proper place; and a sign of this is that one leg is extended over the other when compared, and the place of the dislocation is found empty in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the affected area above the anus itself with a similar circular cautery, after marking the circumference of the anus with ink as it revolves, so that the anus itself falls within the centre of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the same form as that used in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, using a large olive-shaped cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin overall.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and moisture; and the patient is treated with what we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary to free the patient from gross humours with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar remedies.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of them is to cauterize over the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space between each cautery be the thickness of a finger; let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle over the head of the hip itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore, there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one: so that the circle contain the entire hip.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If however it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, over the place to which the sick person points there, where the pain is, and with your cautery on the calf four fingers to the wild side for a little while: and let the cautery be a knife-like one.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the sick person indicates that the pain extends to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a puncturing cautery, three, or four, or more, if he needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife-like cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauterizations, that you do not proceed with the cautery to the point of burning a nerve, or a major artery, and thereby bring upon the sick person a great harm, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And indeed I have already seen one and another, of those who have cauterized above the ankle, and have proceeded too far in their cauterization, and the leg has swollen, until the swelling reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted; then there followed a rupture of the belly, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men have said in the cauterization of the buttock, whose cautery this is the method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date stone, or a little less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between each cautery be the size of a thumb's knot: and let the cauteries be open on both sides: and let their height be like a knot, or two knots: and make for them a handle of iron fitting well into the cauteries.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it should be heated in fire until it glows red and throws off sparks; then it should be placed upon the affected buttock of the patient lying on his healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries in a single turn.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, apply plasters with butter, and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, with this kind of cautery, my children, we have used it little, because of the terror of its appearance, and because we find few who wait upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is a good cautery for him who suffers, and finds its place with him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	A cautery, however, is made with burning medicines, so that you make two samia having a perforated armilla, into which descends the hinge of its door, made of bronze or iron, the length of the wall; on whose height they should have two knots, or similar to them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space between each be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above, and let them hold each other together in this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on a box of ashes, the sick person lying on their healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand firmly on the box of ashes.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been warmed with fire for a short time, and hold it for a quantity of an hour's time; and let the sick person endure its burning, and its cauterization, for he finds the burning like fire, until the burning subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument and wash away the hot water from the entire ash with fresh water; then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter on it, until the blackness of the burning is removed; and leave it for a few days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the final help.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a poultice on it, containing water, in the same way as you did for the ash.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and quicklime, each one part: grind both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part has a single small hole, according to the quantity that the radius will enter: and place another glass pot beneath the bottom of the pot: and pour over the alkali and lime clear water, so that both are submerged by a finger's breadth; then press them with your hand by pressing well; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the lower part of the glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water and pour it over more lime; and strain it until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For it will then be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of other limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from medicines are those with which the ankhs are cauterized, also like tesisie, and honey of the anacardi, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen himself, recounting, reported the cure of a certain man from the ancients, by which the pain of the ankh and sciatic vein was cured: and he magnified that it was very great.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, because he did not need any other cure, and because he was healed in one instance, until he reported, that perhaps he had entered a bath carried, and exited from it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from green seitaragi: and if green is not found, take dry, fresh: and it is to be ground a lot with some fat, and placed upon the ankh, where the pain is, or the leg, or in the thigh: and it is to be bound, and left for a quantity of three hours, or for the quantity that the infirm person feels a calming of the burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put him into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body is made moist, put him into a chair.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not necessary for someone to use a cautery with these remedies unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, who also said that goat dung, when cauterized with it the sciatic vein, helps it: and the cautery is done in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Let wool be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed on the deep place, which is between the big toe and the sole, and is closer to the sole.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, and burn it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wool, and let it be until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat it.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore do not cease to do that, until feeling comes to the middle, down to the ankle, and the pain rests.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called the Vaccinum cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain in the back occurs from many causes, either from an accident, or a blow, or an evacuation of superfluities, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and damp material: and indeed the cautery does not apply, except in this sole case, which is done from the infusion of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the patient's evacuation with foul pills, and similar things, let three lines be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the afflicted area itself, after marking with ink five cauteries on each line, or more according to the amount tolerated by the patient's strength: and let the cauterization be performed with a pointed cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, with a middle-clawed cautery, according to this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in the beginning stages of a humpback.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often happens to young infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is: that a constriction occurs in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you find at the lower part of the dorsal spine and its joints, that it has already begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you see it, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular in this shape.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery cover the entire area of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery, make two or three lines of points, and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the location until it is healed with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, that you do not apply the cautery to the hump, which is formed by the spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	Concerning the method of cauterization in gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of the joints are from cold humors, which are poured forth to any member of the body, then when the pains occur in the feet, it is customary for physicians to name it gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is that you cauterize it after evacuation, around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Cuius haec est forma.	Its form is this.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and that often happens, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries on all sides, with this same claw-shaped cautery.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If, however, more cauteries with this cautery are needed, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If, however, the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said concerning the cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pains are only in the hands, then puncture in a circular pattern around the foci, as if two lines revolved.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If, however, pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, above every knot, and above the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the sick person from a good regimen, from the reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God by this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine, or the scrotum, descends to the testicle, and that it is beginning to approach it: then it is necessary that you order the sick person to cease eating on his/her day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And that he/she uses from the lenients, so that excrement descends from his/her belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back, and order him to hold his breath until it emerges, or the scrotum, or intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture over the pubic bone, with a mark whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then cauterize with a cautery, whose form this is, until it becomes white and throws off sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or scrotum, to its concavity.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the attendant place his hand on the place so that the intestine does not come out: and you have now opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on that mark, your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you meet with it the mouth; or again with it another time, if you have not met with it at the mouth the first time.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And prudently observe the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and death or great harm befall the sick person through it.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not meet with the cautery the mouth, your operation is of no benefit.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And the cautery for children should be fine, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat with the remaining ointments, until it is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you put nourishment for the duration of his healing, which will ease his stomach, so that his intestines do not exit with straining and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then, when he wants to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And lessen his labor, and the fullness of food and drink, and loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, he is thus healed with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the treatment of Ruptures with incision in his chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, Ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are incipient, and there is a will that they not increase, then cauterize the Rupture with a round cautery according to its quantity; and let that which is seared from then on be like a third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat him with what we have said, and it will not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some early ones have already said that the Rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is through the width in the upper side of the Rupture, and another line to the lower one.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cautery tongs.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or a blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When in certain limbs pain arises from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery of every limb be a cautery according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat the cautery upon it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because it is customary for these pains to shift from one limb to the one next to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore, it is necessary to pursue them with cautery until the infirmity is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Leprosy patients are sometimes greatly helped by cauterization.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the type of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider that.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the leprosy is stubborn, and you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and it does not descend, nor does it stand; and you fear for the sick person that corruption will encompass his entire constitution: then cauterize him on his head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head known, and a second below it toward the forehead at the end of the hair, and two upon the two horns, and one behind upon the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And hold your hand with the cautery for a little while, until it makes a small impression on the orifice, and the cortices are loosened from it: so that the expiration of gross vapors from it may be relieved, and cauterize with the cautery also upon the spleen itself, according to what has gone before.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy is already spread over the sick person, and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you cauterize with those cauteries which we have said for the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two jaws, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and with six on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the haunches near the tail and one above it, on the very buttock; and with two on the thighs: namely, one on each thigh, and with two on the knees: one on each knee, and with two on the shoulders, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the soft parts of his chest: and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers of his hands and feet: and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the knuckles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes a cautery is applied to the sternum, and another to the stomach, and another to the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add cautery, the more help and benefit there is.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery, as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And there should be cauteries of large and small size, according to the limbs and joints, as has been previously described in the types of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the cautery with herb flour and honey, and with other remedies until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	Concerning the method of cauterization in a state of numbness.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any limb is numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the size of the limb, whether large or small.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery penetrate the skin a little.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes it is cauterized for some numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But let no one presume upon it unless he is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras is old and nothing from the arts of medicine is of use in it, then cauterize over it itself with a deep cautery for a short while, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood; of each, take one part; mix these things together, and apply them to a cloth, and let them adhere to the place until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	Concerning the manner of cauterizing in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When the Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, just as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	Wise men, however, said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	However, it does not seem right to me, because I fear that it will ulcerate: and I have already seen that happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excess causing it, or because of the patient's age, when they are feeble with little blood, or because of the time, and the need to hasten the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery be from the one following the sick person, so that the course of pus may be alleviated.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Concerning the method of cauterization in a corroding evil.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corroding thing is nothing other than corruption walking in a limb, and it corrodes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corroding thing in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then apply many cauteries of fire, small and large iron cauteries, according to what is suitable to the place where the corroding thing is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains at all.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places powdered sulfur with oil, until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not, then repeat the cautery on whatever remains of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And it is sometimes cured by corroding medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it itself arises in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cautery with fire is of quicker benefit; and indeed I have already said that cauterization with sharp medicine is in division; therefore, take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in corns and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This ailment frequently occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered thing that hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And cautery in them is indeed according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for cautery with fire, you should heat a concave cautery similar to a vulture's wing, made of iron, according to the size that encompasses the corn on all sides, and have thin edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it, heated, upon the corn.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then rotate the hand with the cautery around the corn, until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn, and leave it for three days, until it begins to discharge pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply a plaster to it with crushed wild herbs and salt, and leave the plaster on it overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with a generative flesh ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not transformed, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply a cautery to them with hot water.  And it is that you should take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather, and place it on the corn, or the callus.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula.  Hold your hand and rotate it with a gentle pressure, so that the edge of the cannula presses on the root of the corn and the hot water finds its way deep to the root of the corn.  Let the patient wait a little while on the soaking of hot water for an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave him, for the corn is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with each of them, one after the other, until you have dealt with all those that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they are eradicated with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When tremor occurs in someone due to cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or from another cause: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on its chest with a cautery, and on its stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor rests with the cautery of olive oil, and the health of the cold ailment hastens.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul Albathir, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body, which are formed from corrupted gross matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary first to cauterize every head of the pustule with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, whose tip has been ignited with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner, and they do not increase, and the superfluity which makes them is broken, and they are healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in a blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many times a blood flow occurs from an artery which is cut in a wound that happens externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or a cauterization of a limb, and things similar to them; and it becomes difficult to cut it off.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery; and press it firmly, until the blood is blocked under your finger, and nothing more emerges from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place small, olive-shaped cauteries, and many large ones, in the fire; and blow upon them, until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been severed, and place the cautery upon the vein, after you quickly remove your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not cease to do this one after the other, until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and some other harm befall the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off: especially when the artery is large, unless by one of the four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medicines of a property to cut off the blood are placed upon it, and it is bound with a suitable constriction with a cushion.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	However, whoever administers its excision with a ligature and constriction with a cloth, or by applying burning things and similar items, does not benefit it completely, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If, however, this happens to someone, and a physician or medicine is not present for him, then he should begin with the application of the index finger upon the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and with its strong constriction, until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not to be removed, over it continually with very cold cold water, until the blood is congealed and thickened, and severed.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, let him consider what it needs from a cautery or medicine.

Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Albucasis's Surgical Book, Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already said in the first chapter about all illnesses in which it is fitting to use cautery with fire and burning medicine, and its occasions, its causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed there chapters from the head down to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that the seeker may have his question alleviated.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, children, to know that in this chapter is the terror of that which is in the first chapter concerning cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And because of that, it is necessary that there be greater caution in it, since in the operation that is in this chapter, frequently evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of an exit, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision upon a stone, and similar things: from all of which is associated trembling and fear, and death occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest that which causes hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes the ways of men with the ways of infirmities come upon you in this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For among them is he who is angry with his illness, and death is light to him, because of the intensity of that which he finds from his illness and the length of its malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with illness is the fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is he who gives his money, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be greater than your greed and your rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which a praiseworthy succession has arrived.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the treatment of all your sick, prognostication and indication of that to which health is fittingly to be given.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that is help for you in the acquisition of fame and glory, and of memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O children, with His understanding, and may He not take away from you direction and inspiration; for it is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have indeed arranged this chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on the cautery, from the neck to the feet: so that your seeking of what you desire from it, and what you need, may be eased.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Concerning the treatment of water that gathers in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this illness often occurs to children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it happens also from a hidden cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed I have not seen this illness in others than children, and death has hastened to every one whom I have seen of them: therefore it seemed to me to omit the treatment for it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I saw one child of them, whose head was filled with water, and the head grew in every day, until he could not sit upon himself, because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased, until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, indeed, either gathers between the skin and the bone, or gathers under the bone above the sinus.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the treatment in him, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary that you make a single fissure in the middle of the head, in width: and let the length of the fissure be like two knots, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of the lancet.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place those two fissures, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side, and water is depressed when you press it with your hand towards the interior, and it is not hidden from you, then it is necessary that you make three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the fissures with cloths and lint.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then apply a liniment of wine and oil to it until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not allow the head to be bound equally.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick person with all dry food with little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes there is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, ascend with the incision where the abscess and collection of water appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of Arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When catarrhs occur to someone in the eyes, or in the chest, and it is prolonged, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the ultimate treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you wish to cut them, it is necessary that the sick person shave their head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then let the sick person tie their neck with any cloth they have.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are the places that are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with ink on both sides: and cut both with a scalpel carefully on both sides, the incision reaching the bone: and let it be across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it upward with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating exit, which leaps inward with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with ink, and cut until the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which it is necessary to emit of blood, is VI ounces, and perhaps you emit from it more, or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of that according to the quantity which appears to you from the weakness of the infirm person and the fullness of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains on the bone from the sifac, then cut it, so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with linen strips.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a man suffers from chronic hemicrania, or acute catarrhs due to acrid humours, and heat in the temporal muscles, or chronic, severe pain, and similar ailments: and is treated with the methods of medical treatment, and it does not help: then we are experienced in these illnesses in the extraction of the arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of the operation in extracting them is that the weak person should shave the hairs that are in the temples, and aim at the artery appearing in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it indeed shows itself to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few people, or by extreme cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then let the weak person bind his head with any cloth of his: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or warm the place with hot water, until it appears to you by clear manifestation.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula, which I have made a little while ago.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape the skin with it with ease, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards, until you pull it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the layers beneath it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is slender: then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut a part from it according to the amount by which its ends will be elongated and contracted, and so that no flow of blood occurs.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk, or of al-hohod cords, so that putrefaction does not quickly occur in it before the wound heals, and a flow of blood happens.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess that is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do it at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a knife cautery, until its ends are cut, and it will stand in place of the same work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better work, unless the sick person has a fever, or is of a hot complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because cautery is from among those things that help to end humidities.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore, it is a better aid.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cotton; and cushions made neatly should be placed upon it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the removal, treat it with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, meanwhile, during the operation, a flow of blood occurs from an artery, then quickly cut it with a cautery, or fill the place with zegi, and bind your hand tightly until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those are present for you, then place your finger over the place until the blood congeals.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And embrocate the place with water of intense cold, until the sharpness subsides, and it is bound as necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And since that which is lighter and easier to remove from an artery is a vein, cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades; and the sharpness of the two blades should be similar to an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are of much less sharpness than two blades.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp, like two blades, the cold rushes to both of them; and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is held within them, and the flesh is cut quickly; with this, therefore, the work is better than any other work, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with ink; and place both of them intensely hot, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places, so that the distance between its ends may be lengthened.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not completely consolidate with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Concerning the treatment of persistent, acute tear flow from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter Four.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are persistent, and their flow is from the veins situated on the exterior of the cranium: and no medicinal treatment with remedies helps them, and you see the patient's face already reddened, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that the hairs are already corroded with the corrosion: and his eyelids are heated by the intensity of the tears: then the ancients used this operation in their treatment, and they named that treatment with the Sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is that you should instruct the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equally spaced incisions along the length of the forehead: and let the length of each incision be about two fingers, and let one incision be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly offset from the movement of the temples, and the third on the other side: and be careful not to cut the arteries that are on both sides: and keep your hand away from the line of the two lower jaws, and let the space of each incision be the size of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dried cloths, with which you dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, whose following is the form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision on the temple side, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin, which is between the two incisions, with the sifac, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do that also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then withdraw this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, called a sharp scalpel, one side smooth, the other side not sharp.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and drive it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except what continues the incision up to that which appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal quantity of blood runs out, express the places from the clots of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every fissure a linen cloth from old cotton, and place over them cushions soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer a plentiful infusion with lukewarm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with basilicon ointment, and the other things with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs in the eyes from interior parts of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute, severe, persistent catarrhs befall someone, and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their gaze already impaired; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, damaging pain deep within the head, and a subsequent sneezing; then, from these occurrences, understand that these matters, and catarrhs, do not arise unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is that you should order the sick person to shave their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then, make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or another slightly wider, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach the bone; and move your hand away from the temporal muscles, which move during chewing, until the bone is exposed; and you will dry the entire blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with old cloth, or with linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind them from above with pledgets: and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you loosen it, and see that the hot abscess is already lessening, then you should rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that promotes the growth of flesh; for example, if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of resin, and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water, vinegar, and similar things; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	Therefore, when a stone, or a kind of stone from those that do not adhere nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you then see the stone, instill into the ear some oil of violets or sesame.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer its extraction, and cause sneezing with condiments, and plug the nostrils at the advent of sneezing, after you have placed in a circle around the ear fragments of cloth or wool, and you extend the ear upward.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For it often emerges with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If, however, it does not emerge, then administer its extraction with gestures, that is, with fine tweezers: whose shape is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If it therefore emerges with the tweezers, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine, single-pronged hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If it still does not emerge by that, then make a tube of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole deeply, and seal what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no way for air except through the tube; then extract with your suction device with strong pulling.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For many times it emerges with what we have described.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If, however, it does not emerge in this way, then take a small amount of helkalimbat, or of viscus, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, and place it at the tip of the rod after you have carefully wrapped a cloth around it; then insert it into the ear hole easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If, therefore, it does not emerge with all that we have described, then hasten to incision, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of the incision is, that the phlebotomist first make a weak incision in the cephalic vein, and extract from it blood according to the measure of his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near his fat in the depressed area there; and let the incision be shaped like a crescent, until you reach the stone; then remove it with what instruments you can.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then close the incision quickly with your suture, and care for it until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, it does not yield to you for exit, then take a thin, slender spatula, of this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the excision of that kind of grain which falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that the grain is already moistened by the ear's vapor, until you place many small pieces of it; then extract them with hooks, or with a thin probe, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is thereby eased.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	However, in the water that enters the ear, it is necessary for the afflicted person to use a sneeze, first of all; and already he has filled his ear with some old cotton; and he is lying on that ear, in which the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If, therefore, it exits through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them with fire for a short time, and let the afflicted person insert one of them into the opening of his ear; and let him jump on his foot on that side, and strike with another stone the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, he should not cease to do that with stone and stone, until all the water emerges.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water emerges in such a way that you take one from papyrus or from rushes, and insert one end of it into the ear; and set fire to the other end with fire, until most of it is burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then again use another rush, and do that many times, until all the water emerges; and extract it with a cannula according to what was previously stated about the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is of small body, like a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all those that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you ought to look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the form, narrow below, wide above; and introduce the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the infirm person tolerates; then suck with it a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If, however, they do not yield to you for exit, then smear the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not come out with what we have said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have already tested for the destruction of worms; and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring of oils and medicines into the ear be with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it from silver, or bronze, narrowed at the bottom, having a small hole, wide at the top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let the part that pushes, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be made of bronze, properly made.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap lint around its end with a suitable wrap; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you wish from among these into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert the rod with the lint on top, and press it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is propelled into the concavity of the ear, and the sick person feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear should already have been warmed a little with fire; and beware that the thing that is distilled into it be not very cold, for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Concerning the treatment of an accidental obstruction of the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some people that the ear passage is obstructed by a wound or flesh grown there.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this obstruction sometimes occurs deep within the ear cavity, where vision does not reach; and sometimes it happens near the exterior of the cavity, and vision follows it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which happens deep within the ear, and which the gaze does not encompass, is in many cases difficult to heal.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which is visible, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look at it.  Then if you see the obstruction, open it with a slender probe, whose shape is as follows: its end should have a small width, one part being pointed; and the remainder of the probe should have two smooth sides, so that it does not injure the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the obstruction is from flesh grown in the ear canal, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it out with gentle force, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the obstruction is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod and warm it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If, therefore, you feel an obstruction with which the patient experiences a dullness of hearing, attempt its opening with care; and be cautious not to injure the ear's nerves.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then apply a compress to the ear, corresponding to the size of the wound, wrapped in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days, until you are certain of the wound's healing.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a compress and soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle powdered zegi on it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear already suppurating, then you should remove the compress and apply another one, wrapped in a cloth made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides; then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, bleeding occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water and apply it to the ear.  And use the remaining treatment, which stops bleeding as described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Concerning the treatment of ulcers of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These ulcers that occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, you should hold them with forceps or a hook, and cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place pounded zegi on the affected areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine, lens-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the treatment of Granularities of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many times something happens in the eyelids which is similar to Granulation in its strength and hardness, and on account of that is called Granulation: and it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore, the operation on them is, that you should then consider, if it is Granulation proceeding in that which appears of the eyelid, and moves to every part, and its matter is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, make a fissure over it by its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from every part with ease, until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If, however, its excision is not prepared for you, unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the sick person in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the fissure is large, then gather it together with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and heals it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the swelling is sloping inward toward the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the swelling with a hook; besides which, you need an incision, and press it from every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is lengthened by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the swelling's incision with salt water, and treat the area with what heals, until the sick person is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Concerning the treatment of the swollen eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the tissues of the upper eyelid; it most often occurs in children, and it weighs down their eyes, and they have cataracts in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them, and because of that you see them lying on their faces constantly, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids beneath their eyebrows are moist, which swelling has already covered; and the prominence of the Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its operation is that the sick person should place his head in your bosom.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth, and prepare on it strips, and make a circle from that strip according to the quantity that Axirnath contains on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it upon it, and press with your fingers on all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then make a small incision into the middle of that moisture with a lancet, along its breadth, and let the incision not be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in the depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary to pierce the whole skin until you reach the Axirnath, for in many arrangements the Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore extract it with the cloth, which you have placed between your fingers toward the outside; and you will turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed; and beware, lest you put in the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet, and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	However, if Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you shall add a little to the incision with ease, until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And of men there are those who grind salt, and place it in the concavity of the incision, so that it liquefies that which remains of that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however there occurs in the place a hot abscess, then treat it with sedative plasters, until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the methods for Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye is softened, whence it happens that it is wrinkled as it should not be.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When superfluous hairs sprout in the eyelids, beyond the natural hairs, and grow old: then they harm the eye, and cause various illnesses, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and white discoloration, until it becomes a cause of the eye's destruction.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed, Ataxmir of the eye is cured according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with a sharp medicine, according to what has been previously stated in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by tubes, according to what I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and cause the needle with the thread to penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs sprout: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with the radius.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid beneath the added hairs with a spatula moving from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the thread, and place a small cushion of cotton, or cloth, beneath the eyelid; then mark upon the eyelid with ink, which shall be like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since it is already diversified in humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For among them is one who needs a large amount to be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount that softens from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then, with a spatula, find above the two lines you have marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the incision be near the natural hairs, as thick as a ray.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then introduce the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape off the entire thing.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together the two lips with a needle and thin wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and make that which is left over from the threads adhere to the two eyebrows with certain inconspicuous things, if you wish to do it: and if not, do not bother.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the sutures and threads until three or four days, afterward care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures, and care for it with that which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is lifted during the sealing of the wound and its bringing together: but it will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of treatment the ancients taught.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is care for the sick person in it, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a figure, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have related.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then lift the eyelid with three separate hooks, or joined together, according to this following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not made equal: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and join the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand with equal elevation; and raise the skin on which the mark is made, as we have related.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then join the two lips of the wound with sutures: and care for it until it is healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If however an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with a cauterizing agent, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelids also, that its hairs are turned.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you ought to use what we said about the incision: but the suture is more artificial for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with canes.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is within, according to what I have narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then, skillfully make two canes, or two thin pieces of wood, whose length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width be less than the width of a spatula; and you have already incised at the extremities of each on both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then carefully apply each to the excess of the eyelid, and tightly bind the two canes on both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the tightened skin will die, and turn black, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it is consolidated, the eyelid is lifted; and the hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two canes, which you shall make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Concerning the lifting of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in it is that you shall take a slender needle, and introduce into it a slender, smooth thread of silk.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather its ends, and make a very fine knot on each side: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then place under it, in a short while, another slender thread in the Alinxotati, and knot its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the sick person place his head in your bosom, and be close to the sun so that the operation is revealed; because it is a subtle or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then introduce the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up to the alinxotati: and introduce that hair into the alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the alinxotati into the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	However, if the alinxotati is pulled and the hair does not emerge with it: pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread that you have placed on it, until the alinxotati emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with the vision of the eye: then pull the alinxotati, and the thread; and remove both, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and it is lifted with it; or leave it, until it elongates after a time, and then lift it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati occurring in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Accidental, therefore, it arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to them.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation in it is that you should find that consolidation, and separate its edges, and place in what is between them a linen cloth, and tie it, until it is healed.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things which dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: indeed, use in it things which soften, such as fenugreek; and embrocate with water in which marshmallow, linseed has been cooked; and with the ointment dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some of the oils; and wrap with it a linen cloth, and treat with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is that you should strive with all ingenuity, so that it is not consolidated according to the form it first had.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described is only a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the shape of the place does not return to what it entirely was.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which occurs below, is the one truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one arises from a wound, or a fissure, or a cautery, and things similar to those.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of treatment in it is that you should take a needle, on which a double thread is fastened, and dip it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the flesh at both ends.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then, stretch the flesh upward with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If, therefore, the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a probe, and place it in the fissure, and with it turn the eyelid: and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle from them: until, when they are brought together, their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then bring together the separated parts; sew it with a wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, about softening medicines, and compresses, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if a laceration occurs from the fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, even as before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a compress, as we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of treatment for Alxatrat, when it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the Alxatrat preparation.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it has many diversities in form, and a prudent artisan prepares an ingenious method in any way possible to it, until it restores the figure to its natural form, or nearly so, and the weakened one itself, according to what is suitable for it from the operation and instruments in various arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid consolidates with the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you must introduce the tip of a probe under the eyelid, and lift it upwards, or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharp, but slightly blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and injures the eye with its sharpness; and your incision should be like scraping that adhesion away easily, until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, washing it with the water; or distil it onto it from a sieve made from dissolved ziniar with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid and the eye with flax thread; and place wool soaked with egg white over the eye; and after three days use a sieve, and with consolidants, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Concerning the incision of the nail and the eminence of the tear ducts.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and it is similar to hard, fine sinew.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not fasten to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both species do not begin, unless from the larger tear duct, until it gradually extends, until it covers the sight, and obstructs the light, and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation in its incision is: that the sick person should place his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with a hook of a few folds, and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from a horse's hair, or an ox's, or a cow's: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair to its last part.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear duct tissue, so that a continuous flow of tears does not occur from its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with a thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape with a gentle spatula, whose form is this.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful that the spatula does not touch the corneal membrane, and a rupture occurs in it, and the pupil is pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, put some ground salt into the eye, or a paste made from ziniar, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with what is necessary until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is treated many times with medicines, and is healed as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to cut it, then open the patient's eye and take a fine, gentle, weakly pointed spatula, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the nail from above with delicacy.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it becomes thin and breaks, and the scraping marks it, then distil from your hour glass into the eye a solution made from ziniar, or from red sief, or from crushed salt: and bandage the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation on it, until the entire thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye; then leave it, and treat the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with scraping, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the fleshy prominence of the tear duct causes a great injury to the eye, it should be suspended with a hook, and a portion of it cut away; and do not make the incision too deep, so as not to harm the tear ducts.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then instill into the tear duct a red, or prepared, ziniari, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and the flesh growing in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in some people's eyes, red flesh grows, either composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles a rose-hip.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation in it also is, that the sick person should place their head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with suitable hooks: and hold it with a single forceps, or tongs.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh in the first place, until its whole is finished with a scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, by which you cut it, be either with a lancet, as we described in the incision of the hoof; or with small scissors, with which the asabel is gathered, according to its form after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your incision is completed, and the entire alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or distill into it red powder, and similar corrosive medicines; and place over the eye externally a cloth with egg white: so that it is protected from a hot abscess.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If anything of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which calms the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with the added flesh which occurs in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of every weak eye by natural or accidental means, operating with iron; and do not put your hand in any of these operations, until you see that the member is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are red veins that are woven over the eye, and they impede the eye's operation of vision; and they weaken the eye with the length of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which the Sebel is present is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides the Sebel; then collect its Sebel.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is so that you should instruct the sick person to place his head in your bosom.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your prudence; and let the hook be a thin double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded on one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with fine scissors with precision, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and dissolved; and beware of injuring the eye with the extremities of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the midday before the sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not injure anything other than those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then instill into the eye a green or red sieve, so that its sharpness corrodes what remains of the scab.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	However, if it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye, and leave it for a few days until its pain subsides and it is safe from a hot abscess; then again over it according to the same method until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Concerning the repositioning of the fractured nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call the fistula Arissati, which you treat with a cautery, or with a burning sharp medicine, according to what its description preceded.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it; unless you split open the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture and pus within it, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the Asperi head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like a *azir*, which should be pointed by filing or by a fine *aliskilferi* point, and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then revolve it between your fingers, and you press your hand for a short while, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	Therefore, if the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus ceases; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not become an abscess, and no mishap occurs in it; then you shall know that it is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no remedy for it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you uncover the bone from the second with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is uncovered, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron tip be triangular; and let its wood be a tapered pyramid down to the tip, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it upon the bone itself; and let it be close to the tear duct; and move your hand a little away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then revolve your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone, and the infirm person feels it; by this, that he finds wind issuing from it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens, then the matter that was flowing outwards returns to the nose; therefore it is lighter for the infirm person.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	Concerning the reduction of the prominence of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision, then you should release the patient; then bleed him; afterward, apply cupping to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then apply to the eye a liniment made of acacia, aloe, olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye from above with a plaster with many bandages.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the bandages is: that you take many soft cloths, and double each cloth over four; make many of them; then place them one over another, according to the amount the eye needs; then bind over them with a hard cloth with a strong binding.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the cupping with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the cupping, and leave the eye bandaged day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If however the bandage softens again, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye has now returned the uvea tunic, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, and bandages, and binding, and cupping, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Concerning the incision of the uvea tunic.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the uvea tunic, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a uvea grain, and disfigures the appearance of the person because of it, and one wishes to cut it: then the operation in it is as I describe: and it is to insert a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle, on which a double thread is, from the tear duct side, and cause it to penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea in the circumference of the needle; and tighten it a lot.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then withdraw the needle, and place on the eye wool soaked in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread falls with the uvea.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the uvea is tightened from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a thin spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the white moisture runs out, and the eye descends, and immediately enters; then tighten it until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness, called Alcomnati, is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not the eye itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is to make the infirm person sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take its head in your hands at two sides, and move it, until you see the pus reach the lower parts of the eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then let it be fixed, and not descend, and the light be released: and let the infirm person see things as they were seeing: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the infirm person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a thin spatula, and cut with it on top of the horny membrane a little at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, at the crown, until pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it comes out, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Of the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already discussed the types of water in division, and which is suitable for perforation, the speech stating and explaining it; then take that same one according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye, and tie it tightly; then, with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right. press the eyelid of his eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand an almagda, if the eye is the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the extremity of the almagda near the crown, by the thickness of a ray, on the apparent white of the eye, of the smaller tear duct; then push the almagda with force; and you revolve your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye; and you feel that the almagda has already reached the empty thing.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's journey to the depth be the measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see them in the pupil itself of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almagda up to the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it below, one time after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the almagda in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then put it down a second time, apart from which the almagda emerges.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the almagda with ease: and you turn your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve some of clear gem-salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place a whole piece of lint, or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, outside the eye, and bind the healthy eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, and those who are of our time, place crushed cumin with egg white on it.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the almagda does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from humans whose eye is very hard, then it is necessary to take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, scrape with it only the conjunctiva itself, and do not put your hand into the opening; and there is nothing other than to make a subtle path to the almagda's place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almagda, according to what we said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare for the sick person a properly made sleeping place, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark house; and forbid him all movements and coughing; and place his food that which soothes his nature; and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then loosen it in that dark house, and test his vision; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not fitting that he do it at the time of the treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it is fitting that he postpone it; because water ascends quickly due to a forceful look.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	However, if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary that you loosen the eye before the seventh day; and treat it with that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed; then, free its vision, and place over his face an oral [something] by which his vision is governed under those days, while he is in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him emerge from the house gradually, and let him mingle in his own houses.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in zaltea a student is not excused from vision on any occasion; then, let him dare on the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed, there has come to us someone from those who are of Alayrach, who said that a perforated magdan was made in Alayrach, from which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	However, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that; nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of species from the magdan, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon it.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made properly of bronze; and let their extremities be triangular with this same subtlety, and their extremity pointed.
Formae magda.	Forms of the magdan.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Concerning the care of flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter Twenty-Four.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes diverse growths of flesh are born in the nose, among which is something resembling a scorpion with many feet; and from it is cancerous, stony flesh, of a dark color; and from it is flesh that is soft, not of a dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	Therefore, in the soft flesh from among these growths, which is not deceitful, nor cancerous, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the ground, and open his nostrils; then introduce a hook into the flesh; next, draw it outward, and cut off what you have grasped with a fine, sharp spatule, on one side, until you know that the entire growth has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains of it that cannot be removed, then scrape it with one of the fine instruments with ease, until nothing of it remains.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	However, if blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs; then apply to it what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is removed and all the flesh is taken away.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then, after the incision, vinegar, and water, or wine, should be applied to the nose.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If however, the nose opens, and moisture flows from it to the palate, then know that it is now healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it is flesh grown on the upper nasal bones, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is necessary to insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place between each knot a quantity of a finger, or less; and let the sick man, with a rod, or with whatever is possible for him after having made it similar to a saw, place one end of the thread into his nose; and pull out his offensive matter, until it reaches the bottom, and emerges above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times indeed, children in schools do a thing similar to this; and it is an easy thing for him who wishes to do so.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that emerges above the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then remove the flesh shavings with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do that until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread, and place in the nose, after washing away the blood, a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or longer, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place at the end of the thing in the nose a lead cannula, for some days, until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it needs a treatment that will dry it out, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For making nasal douches, with which oils and other medicines are instilled into the nose, make it of silver, or bronze; that it be similar to a small lamp, open like a seashell; and its passage be likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a tube.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the seashell instrument for nasal douching should be full, uncovered; on whose back end there should be a handle, with which you hold it, when heating oil, or whatever you wish of juices, and runny substances, in it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Concerning the treatment of nasal warts.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often a wart is born at the tip of the nose, and it grows larger and larger with the days, until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And therefore it is necessary, that one cut it off at the beginning of its appearance, and remove the entire thing.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place on the area either a cautery or a burning medicine in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If, therefore, its excision is delayed until it grows, then consider, if it is stony, hard, of dark color, and with little sensitivity: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For often I have seen that when someone incised such an abscess, great harm resulted for the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible throughout its extent, then evacuate the pus and cut it without fear, without hesitation: and treat the area with something that dries and contracts it, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Concerning the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little benefit results from any operation, unless in certain individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood: and then bring together the edges of the wound with sutures; then treat it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the lips of the separation of continuity are already separated, and each part is sound: then you ought to scrape away all the part from its apparent skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then bring together the two lips with sutures, and bind them tightly, and powder over it the blood of the dragon, and powdered frankincense: and place upon the powders a piece of a diafinicon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters; and leave it bound for two days, or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then loosen it, and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads are severed by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is, that you bring together the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we have narrated in the suturing of the belly; or bring the separation together with thread, as I have made you know.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Concerning the extraction of lip nodules.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people frequently have hard abscesses like grains of grass in the interior of their lips: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary to turn back the lip and cut over every nodule on it, and to suspend it with a hook and cut it from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with pounded zegi until the blood ceases.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then wash it with vinegar and treat the place, where there is astringency, with it until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Concerning the incision of fleshy tissue grown over the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often flesh grows over the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, it is necessary to suspend it with a hook; or to hold it with forceps, and to cut it at its root, and to allow the pus, or blood, to run.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then apply to the place ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it; for it does not return after the cautery.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	Concerning the extraction of teeth with an iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes rough, foul, and sometimes blackened, or yellowish, or greenish, hard masses gather on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer sides, and between the gums, until corruption from them reaches the gums, and the teeth become unsightly because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should have the sick person sit between your hands, with their head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth, where the hard masses, like sand, appear, until nothing remains of them, and similarly deal with the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and other such things, until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore that which is in them is removed at the beginning of the scraping, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second time, and a third time, until finally you attain the desired result.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes and forms, according to what the preparation of your operation requires; therefore, the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the scraper used for scraping between the teeth, according to different shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these shapes of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Concerning the extraction of toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You should treat the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and be slow in its eradication.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing to replace it when it is pulled out, since it is a superior substance. Until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then it is necessary when the sick person is forced to pull it out, that it be strengthened, and that you, the tooth, aching tooth, be assured.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth itself and pulls it out.  Then the pain does not recede until the sick person's tooth is pulled out.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is assured, you should make incisions around the tooth with a lancet, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides.  Then move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps, at first gently, until you break it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and hold the patient's head between your knees. What you have now firmly held, so that it does not move. Then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from every side with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If, however, the tooth is perforated or decayed, then you should fill that hole with cloth and bind it with the end of a fine reed, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary to carefully make incisions around the gum on every side very much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And maintain your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns to the patient from that evil which is greater pain than his first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware that you do not do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and boldness in their eradication of it, beyond what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often cause great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to break, and the roots of it all, or some of them, remain; or to extract it with some of the jawbones, as we have often witnessed.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be rinsed after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often does), then take some of the zegi and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick, so that they do not double when pressed against the tooth; they should be like the handles of thick things, until, when you tighten them, they do not yield or double: with short extremities, and they should be made of strong iron or good steel, with straight extremities; and on their extremities should be teeth, some of which enter into others, and bind with a proper, strong tightening.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the extremities are shaped like the mouth of a bird called a stork, and have a strong grip.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	On the removal of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When, during the extraction of a tooth, something is left behind, you should place a poultice of butter on the area for one or two days, until the area softens.  Then, introduce algasti, or forceps, whose extremities are shaped like the beak of a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The form of these forceps is...
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Let their ends be made like a file inside, or like an aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you carefully work around the root, and expose all the flesh, and insert the instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it have a short, somewhat thick end, and let it not be soaked, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with these other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first is triangular with a certain thickness at the end.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of a triangular, slender end.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also it is helped with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that have preceded in the reasoning about teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also, there is help with this instrument that is like a large hook, of this form, with a twisted triangular end, where there is something of thickness so it does not break, and it is not soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that instruments for teeth are many, and similarly the other instruments are not counted, and a skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument according to which the operation and the illnesses themselves signify to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not say an instrument, due to the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, a bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrefies, then probe over it in its place with what suits it from the instruments and forceps that I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and assist with a pick, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be something of thickness gradually, so that the bone is tightened or held with it, and does not flee and go, until the bone emerges; and restore the place with the appropriate medicines for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction, and treat it until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the sawing of prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ugly form is produced by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those of easy virtue.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth has grown after another tooth and does not have its place, or its sawing or filing is not possible, then extract it; and if it is joined to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made from hard iron, with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision, by which you cut it, be over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another tooth is not moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however it is prominent, exposed to its filing, then file it with a file of hard iron, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let the whole be of hard iron, and its handle with very small points, like the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then gently smooth it, and at the end shave it with some razors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If a tooth has a part that has broken off and hurts the tongue, then it is necessary to file it, until the roughness of that fracture is removed and it is made even, and flattened, and does not hurt the tongue, nor spoil speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Concerning the retention of teeth with gold threads.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth are knocked and moved by a blow or fall, and the weak person cannot bite on what they eat so that it does not fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment was not successful, then a way exists to bind them with gold thread, because silver becomes green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the thread be medium in thinness and thickness according to the amount that it will take between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the method of retention is to take a thread, and insert double its length between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the thread between the moved teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weave to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving back to the place where you began: and bind your hand with delicacy and skill, until it is completely fixed; and let your binding of the thread be near the roots of the teeth, so it does not come loose.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors; and join both together, and twist them with a twist; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue; then let it be left thus fastened as it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it comes loose, or is cut, bind them with another thread, and it will hold with it thus for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the method for teeth, and the manner of retention of two healthy teeth, and two moved teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that a single tooth, or two, return after falling into their places, and are retained as we have described, and remain; and an artful, prudent, and experienced person does not accomplish this.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a suitable piece of bone is fitted; and it is made in the shape of a tooth, and placed in the place from which the tooth is strengthened and bound, as we said; and it remains, and serves with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Concerning the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is that you open the mouth of the sick person on his head in your lap, and raise his tongue; then cut that nervous ligament along its width, until the tongue is released from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something of hardness and knotting in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then insert a hook into it, and split it along its width, until you cut the ligament, and the knotting is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, lest there be a fissure deep in the flesh, and you cut an artery there, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then it should be rinsed at the site of the incision with rose water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place under the tongue a linen bandage, which the sick person should hold all night: so that it is not consolidated again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If however a flow of blood occurs, then place pounded zege over the spot.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, blood overcomes you, then cauterize the place with a lentiginous cautery, suitable for it; then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Concerning the extraction of a Ranula, which is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes a boil occurs under the tongue, resembling a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in it is to open the mouth of the sick person before the sun, and consider the boil.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it to be of dark color, or black, hard, to which the sick person has no feeling: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then thrust a hook into it, and cut it with a fine scalpel, and free it from every side.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place on it pounded zegi until the blood ceases; then return to your operation until you extract it with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and treat it with the remaining appropriate treatment for it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat, that is, glands, which are similar to almonds, that occur externally; and are named two tonsils: which when you treat with what we said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore it is a hard abscess, of a dark color, with little feeling, then do not touch it with an iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of a reddish color, and its root is thick, then do not touch it even with an iron, fearing a flow of blood, but rather leave it until it ripens.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it, or it will break open by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is thin, then it is necessary to cut it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is that you should consider, before its operation, if its abscess has rested and completely calmed down, or is diminishing with some reduction: then, therefore, make the sick person sit in front of the sun, and let his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let the servant take in their hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is as thin as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	Therefore, when you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is revealed to you, and your vision falls upon it, then take a hook, and fix it into the tonsil, and pull it outwards as far as you can, besides which, you should pull out with it something from the coverings.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, whose shape follows this.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It resembles scissors; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is in line with the other's sharp point: therefore, take care that it is made of tempered iron, or soaked in alfuled.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If, however, this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose shape is this.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	One side should be sharp, the other side should not be sharp.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same method of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then, after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled: or with myrtle leaves, and things similar to them that are astringent, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, cut it according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself have already treated a woman from an abscess that had arisen between her throat, which was drawing towards blackness, with few sensations, which had nearly closed her throat: and the woman was breathing from a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her food and water: and she had already come to death if she had remained for one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches, until they had emerged above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	Therefore I quickly hastened and fastened a hook to one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large portion came away from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same to that which emerged from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fastened a hook into the abscess; then I cut a portion from it, and only a little blood flowed from it; therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times for a long time, and the abscess succeeded in the place where I cut, until it was prolonged too much and with it that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore it stood apart; then I walked away from her, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Concerning the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes an abscess, and it is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the hot abscess has quieted from it, and it is thin; then it is necessary to incise it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And whatever is collected from it, round, and has no length, and is blood-red, or dark-brown, or black, and has no feeling: then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For in it is fear upon the infirm.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the way I have described, from its whiteness and length, have the infirm sit before the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument, of which the account has preceded; then fasten a hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards; and incise it with one of the two instruments which I have said concerning the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary not to incise from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you incise from it more, you will injure the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then, after the incision, use that which we have described in the incision of the two tonsils, and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	However, if the infirm is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary to use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear and terror.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the mode of the cautery on it is not, except with sharp water, and it is, that you place the head of the infirm in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water I spoke of to you in the chapter on cauterization, and make with it lime not extinguished, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, whose form is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be like the concavity of a spoon's radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself: and let the sick man lie on his side, that the saliva may run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing may descend from it to his throat, and hurt him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you shall keep it on the uvula for a quantity of half an hour, until you see it already blackened, and the biting of the medicine quieted.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a clot, and wrap it around the extremity of the radius, and infuse the clot with the medicine, and introduce the radius with the clot into the cannula from above, until the clot adheres to the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you achieve what you desire concerning the cauterization of the uvula.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it; for it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with a clot soaked in butter, and cleanse with it what is around it from the medicine; and rinse with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And treat it externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This method of treatment is therefore healthier and further from danger than incision.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the uvula is also treated with something more delicate than cautery and incision: for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamus, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs to them: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil them: and let the pot be smeared with clay properly: and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is to be placed in this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or bronze: and let the end, in which there is a pomegranate, be inserted into the sick person's mouth, until the vapor ascends to the uvula over the cannula, until the uvula becomes very dark.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's onset.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it usually adds to the abscess: and you should not do it unless at the decline of its hot abscess.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If however this instrument is not present for you, then take a reed and place the rind of an egg at its end, so that the sick person's mouth is not burned; because the egg rind prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is from good treatment with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else, adheres in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, it is necessary to extract whatever of them is apparent upon which the sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the sun, and it is declared to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the vomiting weak before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge, and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it reaches the place where there are spines, or bone, and it is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a Radius a little, and at its extremity let there be a bend, which he should introduce into his throat with ease; and let him have his head elevated upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest coughing should befall him, and push with it the bone, or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But that which the sick person introduces is better, on account of his knowledge of the place of the thing attached; and let him push downwards, or pull his hand with the instrument upwards, the whole of it according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Concerning the extraction of the Leech.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When a leech is medicated with what I have said in the division concerning treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the sick person in the presence of the sun, or in the sun, after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I have described to you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with fine forceps skillfully.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them, then take a hollow cannula, and introduce it into the throat of the sick person up near the throat; then introduce into the concavity of the cannula a heated iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times; and let the sick person abstain from water the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If however it does not emerge with what we have described, then fumigate the sick person with fleas, or with asa, with the instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, since it will fall itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot in which are live coals with fire; and the pot be covered with a cover, in the middle of which be a hole; and the extremity of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then, direct the fumigation, and let the sick person place his mouth on the extremity of the cannula, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will fall immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick person tolerate thirst, and eat salt and garlic, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, it is necessary that it depart with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon it visibly.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature that is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its tip is like the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go completely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and their general care.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	Abscesses have many species, of many kinds, according to the recollection of them, that is, one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation and incision by two methods.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is from the species of an abscess in itself, and in that which it comprises from the humors.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is because of the locations in which it occurs in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy location is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And among abscesses are some that should not be pierced, unless after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion; and of them are some that should be pierced while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as abscesses that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because an abscess, when it occurs near a joint and prolongs its being until that which is around it decays, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore, it is a closer cause of contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay its incision until it matures, it will harm either that or the principal member through it.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it unripe; and it is not fitting to pierce a raw abscess, not of complete digestion, except that which is near the anus, so that it does not decay deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its end that which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the hour of piercing the abscess, which has matured according to completion: and it is in the calming of the pain, the recession of the fever, and the diminution of redness, and pulsation, and sharpness of the head of the abscess: and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same incision in the lower place of the abscess, and of greater prominence: and let the incision be proceeding in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in places of tendons, and cords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those, however, which are reflected, proceed with the incision according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When, however, the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better that you leave its incision, until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Because if you incise it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much pus and filth, and perhaps its lips are hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are incised across the body's breadth when necessary, or according to the member it needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small incision in small abscesses, and a large incision in large abscesses, or many incisions similar to the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses in which the skin must be hollowed out, and incised when it has already become like a cloth, and reached its limit, that it is already dead, like that which happens in many boils and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And of them there are some which are incised with an incision having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And of them there is one which is incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like the groin abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And of them there are some in which a round incision, and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions are administered.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That which does not have a head, like mild superficial abscesses, should be perforated with a superficial or merely flat perforation.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, you should not be hasty and extract all the pus at that time; rather, extract a part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then, close the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some more pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this repeatedly according to the degree, until it comes out; especially if the sick person is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old decrepit person: for the animal spirit of the animal is repeatedly resolved with the discharge of the matter, and perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not perceive.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply bandages of linen, or old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and the perforations' fissures are many, then it is necessary that you introduce a bandage into each fissure, until they meet each other.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the abscess you have removed a piece of skin, or hollowed it out in a circle: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when a cloth is woven, or shaved with flax fibers without moisture: and bind it tight for up to three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary of ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however, bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after which a cloth is soaked in them; and place it repeatedly over the site of the bleeding.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If however the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen and treatment and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and in its division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If however it is in wintertime, and the site of the abscess is near many nerves, then it is necessary that you apply heated pads of wine and oil and place them over the affected areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then it is necessary that you place pads soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all of it cool.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when it will be the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer in its treatment that which is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This therefore is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	Following the path of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how there is a way to cure it, itemized and individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the type of bumps, which are contained by the tissues that are like sacks to them; as if they were the sacs of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their types are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some of them are oily; and some of them contain moisture like mud; and some of them contain moisture like gruels and porridges; and similar to them, and some of them are hard, stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And there is no fear in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, as long as the incision does not encounter an artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their incision is, that you should test them with an instrument, whose form will come after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what they contain.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial longitudinal incision, according to this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the incision from line b to line g.  When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the cyst which contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it at all.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns if anything remains of it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the clot in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remained of the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then apply the Egyptian ointment again over the clot, a second and third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst, for then treat the wound with the ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a fatty tumor, then cut it according to this shape, the incision having the form of a cross; and insert hooks between the two sides of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and try your skill in removing the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If however the artery resists you, then do what I will tell you later.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in the abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision upon a stony abscess is easier, because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are in the head in some people, in which there is absolutely no moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman, and found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if anyone struck it with something in order to throw it, it wounded them.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses occurring in the head, however, apart from these abscesses which occur in the heads of children, and near the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation of them always from their lower part, so that the course of pus is relieved downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat it with whatever is appropriate for them from the treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Concerning the incision of the Strophulae in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And those that occur in the neck from them, are one, and many: and are generated from each other: and every Strophula from them is inside its own proper tunic, as is in the knots and abscesses of the head, as we have related.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the types of these Strophulae are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from them are stony ones; and from them are those that contain moisture; and from them are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that, therefore, which of them you see well-disposed to the touch, whose proximity to the skin color is manifest, and it moves to every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the guidegi, nor to the artery, nor is deep: it is necessary to separate it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body from line, b, to line, g, and to scrape it from every side: and extend the two lips of skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and gradually extract it.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is a precaution that no vein or nerve be cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the scalpel not be very sharp, so that it does not add to your hand with the incision, or trouble the sick person, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If, however, you cut a vein or artery, or it hinders you from the operation, then put crushed zegi into the wound, or certain powders that cut off blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound softens, or it begins and wants to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is cut off then. Return therefore to your operation, until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then investigate with your index finger if anything remains of the other small strophes; therefore cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein at the root of the strophe, then it is necessary not to cut that strophe from its root; rather, it is necessary to tie it with a strong doubled thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cloth, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then care for it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire strophe is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the two edges of the wound, and suture it immediately, after you see that there is no more excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If, however, you see that excess remains because of the size of the strophe, then it is necessary to aim to cut its root, and to remove it; and administer the suture that we have described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And whatever humours the strophes contain, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that the place of its maturity appears to you; and place the puncture from that which follows below the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then, after the puncture, apply strips with ointment, and things like them, to corrode what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound already cleansed; then care for it with a generating flesh ointment, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients said that this incision into the epiglottis should be made, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it; and this is the writing of their saying.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those suffering from synocha, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided; because no benefit is gained by it; for all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the passage, it is necessary to use an incision of the epiglottis, to avoid the harm that results from suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do this, we must cut the epiglottis beneath three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across the width, at the point between two circles, so that the incision is on the membrane, not on the cartilage.  This place is indeed suitable for incision, because it is free of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should split the skin until he reaches the passage; he should avoid blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the membrane that we described; and it is signified by the incision of the passage by the phlegm that emerges from it, together with the rupture and the removal of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for a time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the hour in which suffocation is feared is removed, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and sew it itself alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this account we have given is not an exposition unless they see that some of these abscesses have already closed the throat of the sick person: and the sick person is raised above death, and his breathing wants to be cut off: they go to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe over the place of the wound with a certain breath, and be saved from death: and for this reason they prescribed to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days, and like itself: then therefore they prescribed to sew up the wound, and care for it, until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw by myself is that a certain maid took a knife, and thrust it into her throat, and cut a portion of the lung passage with it.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to treat her, and I found her groaning, like the groan of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Therefore I examined the wound, and found little blood that had come out of the wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore I was confident that she had not cut a vein, nor a ligament; and wind was escaping from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore hastened, and treated her wound, and cared for it until it was healthy; and nothing happened to the maid, except hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her better condition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore I say: that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Concerning the section of the hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess, called hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one, certainly, there is no talent.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one, however, is in two ways: one of which is similar to fatty tumors.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is similar to an abscess that arises from the knotting of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is fear, and it is not appropriate to presume to use iron upon it unless it is small; and you should probe it and investigate it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any blood vessels, then cut it, as tumors are cut; and extract it with whatever it contains from the cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then thoroughly explore its entirety.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with whatever is appropriate for healing until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Concerning the cutting of various types of tumors.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of tumors, and I have already described all their types in the divisions; and it is necessary for me to describe here the difference between a tumor and a boil, since it is a source of doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	Therefore, I say that when a boil is present, there is heat, fever, and intense pain until the ebullition of the excess fluid subsides and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	However, with a tumor there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it contains a sack-like cyst, which is its own pouch, and is similar in color to the body; and its beginning is like a chickpea and it becomes like a batecha, and larger or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two types: either fatty, or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of a tumor, you should examine it, and inquire into its form first, with the instrument called the *Intromissum*, in the way its form will be shown in the chapter after this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of investigating abscesses and all tumors is that you should take this instrument, and insert it into the moist place you find in the abscess; and you should turn your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then place your hand at the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the *Intromissum* and consider that which emerges in its wake.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If, therefore, running moisture, of whatever color, emerges, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said in the other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture emerges in the wake of the *Intromissum*, then know that it is fatty; therefore, cut over it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this shape, as I taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and peel the skin from all sides with ease; and if you can, keep a *kistin* over it to extract the healthy one with the tumor.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the *kistin* breaks during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the healthy one—for this often happens—then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if anything small or large remains of it, the tumor returns most often.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it defeats you, and a small amount remains, then fill the wound at your completion with certain sharp corrosive powders; and constrict the wound, and place over it what sits on a hot abscess, and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If, therefore, the tumor is large, then sew its two lips together, and treat it with what causes healing.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If, however, there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein there, then hurry, and fill the place with ground zegi, and leave it constricted for two or three days, until the wound becomes putrid, and the boiling of the blood ceases; then return to cutting what remained of the tumor.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning the instruments for incision and perforation.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Among them are the forms of instruments of insertion, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of tempered iron, with square ends, suitably, so that they may quickly enter the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of instruments, and no, that is, piercing instruments: and one of them is called a *beris*, that is, a piercer: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are suitable for investigating abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and buboes, from that which is between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and gentle, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of citron, or of bronze, or of iron, or of silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those made of citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And experiments are also made with black lead, which are suitable for experiencing fistulas, whose concavity has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their gentleness with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because some of them are long, some of them are medium, and some of them are short, according to the quantity of the fistula's breadth and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because some of them are simple, namely those which have one curvature: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And of them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And of them are hooks having two curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and of them are hooks having three curvatures, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: because of them there is a large, medium, and small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their cutting edges are sharp, other edges are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, unless that with them help be given in scraping nodes, for fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the sick person may be healed by them and find a little peace from the burning which he finds in the scraping of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are large ones, and are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of air, and are similar to the radio with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end is hidden the point of a spatula: and on it runs to the interior, and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shapes of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers when puncturing abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of air, or of amber, round, a little in length, as you see: and be of a fine delicacy.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be large and small with you, so that you may cut off blood with speed in case of need, and then when there is no medicine present for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them for the cutting of blood in every place of the body, and use them only on fleshy parts: such as the calves of the leg, and the thighs, and the arms, and the breasts, and the abdomen, and the groins, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes small instruments like those made of hazelnut shells, in their shape, are made from them; with which blood is cut off when it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein or artery; and sometimes they are made round, in this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Of the care of the breasts of men which resemble the breasts of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of some men become swollen at the time of their sexual arousal in sleep (that is, when they begin to pollute themselves in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain foul-looking abscesses.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever abhors that, should cut above the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form, from line b to line g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Thereafter, fill the wound with a flesh-forming medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	However, if the breast inclines downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to cut it open on its upper two sides with two incisions resembling a crescent shape, each of which is held together with the other at the edges of both, until a larger line contains a smaller one, according to this form, from line b to line g. Afterwards, scrape off the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for the treatment, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	However, if you do not complete the incision that you should make, due to the patient's distress, or due to the flow of blood, then you should fill the wound with lint soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Concerning the perforation of an abscess, which occurs beneath the armpit.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which occur beneath the armpit, are of the species of hard Strophulae, which contain cysts, and of those that contain moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Therefore, those of them which contain moisture, must be incised with a lunate incision, according to this shape, from line b to line g.  When thus the entire pus from the abscess is evacuated, then fill it with old lint, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the lint, and treat it with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the species of knot-like Strophulae, then make an incision over it, as we have said in the section concerning Strophulae, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If however the wound extends in such a way as to emit pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we have said in what has gone before.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs due to artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery bursts, and the skin above it consolidates, then an abscess frequently results from this. And similarly, if a vein bursts, an abscess and swelling occur.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which one knows that the abscess and swelling are due to an artery and vein are these: because, when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, clustered in the deep part of the body, and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And incision upon this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is also from them in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, upon that which is from them due to the inflation of the artery's opening, make an incision into the skin lengthwise.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then, open the incision with hooks, afterward the artery: and free it from its coverings, until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert a needle beneath it, and cause it to penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to how I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then pierce the place, which is between the two ligatures with a lancet, until all the blood within it issues forth, and the abscess is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer a treatment that produces pus, until the ligatures fall off; afterward, treat it with suitable ointments for it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If there should be an abscess because of the incision of a vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what you can of the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a needle beneath the place you held with your hand, and cause it to penetrate; and let a double thread be on it, until you pull it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the abscess itself with a good ligature; according to what I told you in the ligature of the grape, from two sides with two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the needle; press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is within it emerges; then cut away the excess skin, and let that which is tied be from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place on it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment, which is done with lint and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning the abscess that arises from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, so too does an abscess occur in the nerves: this occurs in them through blows, or arises from excessive labor, and similar things; and it most often occurs in the aidor regions, or the heel, and in every place where the joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain; and when it is squeezed with force, the afflicted person feels a similar sensation to numbness in it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a deep-seated, aggregated abscess, but rather is beneath the skin, and it moves in every direction, and does not go forward or backward.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be lanced with an iron instrument.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps contraction will result.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In that which is on the head, or forehead, cut the skin with a scalpel.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps and cut it away from its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it: then remove it, and stitch the wound, and treat it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Some people frequently get growths in their bellies and other parts of their bodies, which are called Fungalia, by reason of their resemblance to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their root is slender, and their head is thick, and their lips are turned inwards.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And some of them are small; and some of them grow very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I myself have seen a man who had two growths in his belly which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, they were white, with slender roots, and their lips turned inward and split, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore I cut them, and found one to weigh about ten and eight ounces, and the other about six ounces.  And the procedure for cutting them is, if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with a slender root, then cut it with a broad scalpel, and have cauteries present in fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often much blood is expelled at its cutting; therefore, hurry if blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see the patient fearful and timid of cutting with iron, then take a thread of lead properly made, and bind the tumor with it: by the method we described, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the lead bandage.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease binding the lead, whenever it presses on the tumor, until it is severed, and falls off by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the tumor is of large root, then in its incision is something of fear and terror, especially that which is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to cut half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it until the wound is healed.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware that you do not presume to cut a tumor that is dark-colored, with little feeling, and of foul appearance: for it is indeed a cancerous abscess; and I shall come with a recollection of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Concerning the treatment of the navel prominence.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The navel prominence arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures in the skin over the abdomen; and from it protrudes wind, or an intestine, just as happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from a vein or an artery, as previously stated.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from confined air in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however it is due to a fissure in the skin, and protrusion of a foul thing, then the colour is like the colour of the body, and it is smooth, without pain, and appears in various locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the exit of an intestine, then its location, with the diversity we have described, is more severe.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps with a sound; and it greatly enlarges at the entrance of the bath, and with considerable exertion.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If however it is due to moisture, it is smooth, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor is it tightened, nor does it increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If however it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears with a blackness from the bottom.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however it is due to generated flesh, then the abscess is severe, large, hard, and fixed in a single quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If however it is due to windiness, then its touch is smooth.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that is, that you should consider then, if the prominence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or windiness: then it is necessary that you abstain from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the navel's prominence is due to the intestine or to a hernia, then it is necessary to instruct the sick person to hold their breath and stand extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Afterwards, instruct him to lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then encircle with a wide spatula around the navel over the place you marked with ink.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Afterwards, extend the middle of the abscess upward with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it firmly around with thread, or with a silk cord or firm bandage; and let the knot of the bandage be tied tightly.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess extended above the bandage.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If therefore you find it already caught by the bandage, then extract the tightly bound, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the belly; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however an artery or vein is contrary to you, then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert in them two strong threads; and insert the two needles in the circumference which you have made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place, until the extended flesh rots: and it falls away by itself; or cut it when it is softened and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary from ointments, until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the eminence of the navel is from flesh there in it, or from moisture, then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess, as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with that which solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Concerning the treatment of CANCER.

Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of Cancer, and how there is a way to cure it with medicines; and we have warned against using iron in its treatment, so as not to ulcerate it; and we have spoken of Cancer generated in the womb, and the caution in treating it.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as Cancer in the breasts or in the thigh, and similar locations on the extremities, by removing the whole of it, especially when it is small and beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	However, when it is old and large, you should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I myself could not cure anyone from it, nor did I see anyone before me who achieved it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the treatment for it, when it is located as we have said, is to proceed, and to relieve the afflicted from the black cholera on occasion.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then phlebotomize it if you find it with clear fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the patient with the preparation, in which it will be placed with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then apply hooks suitable for the Cancer.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not sever it quickly, rather press the areas, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with what is possible there from the instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however the flow of thick blood from an incision of an artery, or vein, gives you trouble, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already described in the division of the species of dropsy, and how the gathering of water occurs; and the signs of each species, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is treated with iron is only the species of ascites alone: and it is not approached with iron for the species of tympanitis: nor for the species of hyposarca completely; for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of tympanitic dropsy with medicines, and your treatment has not availed, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if weakness has already overtaken the patient, or there is another infirmity with him besides the dropsy, such as if there is a cough with him, or looseness of the belly, and things similar to those: then beware lest you treat him with iron, for there is fear of it.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If however you see the patient of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone: and he is not a child, nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is that you raise the patient standing between your hands, and a servant behind him presses his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a pointed spear, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be of two sharp parts, long, and sharp at the end like a spear.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, let it have something of shortness gradually, so that you do not proceed with it in the operation all the way to the intestines, and harm him.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if there is a generation of dropsy from the intestines, then you must extend the incision from the navel by the quantity of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubic bone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If, however, the generation of dropsy is due to a disease of the liver, then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary for the incision to be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that the fluids do not flow to that weak spot.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce the entire skin with the instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and do so as if you were scraping it; and let the quantity that is scraped be the quantity of a fingernail, or approximately that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce, doing so until the spatula reaches the empty space, and that is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the hole the instrument of which this is the shape.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula; it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth and polished; in whose lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side; and the end of it is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see; on its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then it itself descends immediately upon the instrument, thus evacuating a medium quantity from the water.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate more from it than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour through the resolution of his animal spirit; or a fainting spell occurs, which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the disposition of the sick person signifies to you from the strength of his pulse and from his well-being.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it is retained immediately due to the skin that retains the opening which is on the sifac: about which I have recounted, that you should perforate it according to that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then again use the instrument on the following day, if you see the sick person can tolerate it, and also extract a small quantity from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until only a small amount of water remains.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	However, if you fear for the sick person and you remove a large amount of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and with much sweat in a bath and in the sun, and let him endure thirst; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed; and cauterize over the stomach, and liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water, according to what I have recounted in that which preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the treatment of infants born in places where their urine passages are not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its urethra is not perforated, or is a tight opening, or is in the wrong place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, it is necessary to assist with its perforation immediately when it is born, with a very fine Spatumilus, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a thin leaden nail in the opening, and tie it; and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When, therefore, it wishes to pass urine, it should be removed, and it will urinate.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then return it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine which flows over the area will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	However, he whose opening is constricted is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	However, those in whom the opening is in an improper place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	For this reason, in those born with the opening at the end of the penis, they cannot urinate forward until they raise their penis with their hand to the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is there procreation for him, therefore, because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight line; and it is a very foul sickness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of the operation in him is that the sick man be laid on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then, extend his penis with your left hand forcefully, and cut off the head of the penis from the glans area, with a sharp scalpel or a sharp spatula.  Just as one cuts a reed, or just as you shave something so that its middle is similar to a penis head, and that the opening is in the middle as is appropriate.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of blood flow during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, apply to it whatever stops the bleeding, and treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning Albucasis's matters that occur in the foreskin and the glans penis, and concerning corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These things of Albucasis happen often in the penis, and there is a prominence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it is another that is malignant, and another that is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, the non-malignant one, you should suspend with a fine hook, and cut it off, until you cleanse the whole of it.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place over it a poultice steeped in Egyptian unguent.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it afterward with the unguent dyafinicon, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If it is malignant, of foul colour, then you should administer a cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If however the Albather is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised, and part of the Albather is inside the foreskin and part of it outside, then you should remove the Albather that is inside first, until when it consolidates, then treat it externally. For when you treat it simultaneously, the foreskin will not be safe from being pierced.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And they also occur in the testicles, and the foreskin, a blackness and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, it is necessary that you cauterize all that is already blackened, and that which is about to corrupt, or that which is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply a line over it afterwards with honey that has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark, and crushed, sifted herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For cautery is helpful for two dispositions at once, namely for the flow of blood, and for a wound when it corrupts.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the rod is corroded, and the whole is destroyed in an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra, so that the patient may urinate upon it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	However, in the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the rod, and this adhesion does not happen except in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon him: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound, or an abscess: it is therefore necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the rod is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish them precisely, then it is necessary to scrape some of the head of the rod, and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is perhaps perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin and the head of the rod with a thin linen cloth, which has been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with astringent wine, until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is an operation of our own making, done by our own will, and its use is specifically in children, it is necessary that we mark it with an operation more beneficial and a path leading to health more easily.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, since they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Because I have found most of the surgeons and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and scissors; and they use cauterization, and tying with thread, and incision with a knife.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing than with scissors, and tying with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often slips away.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers; therefore, perhaps the upper layer of skin is cut, and the lower layer remains; therefore it is forced to cut again to cut the other, and there will be pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with cleansing that is done by cauterization, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured; because perhaps it enters its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	However, in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron slips out and spoils your operation; and the boy's skin is of a short nature, and many times they are born in such a way that they do not need cleansing; and I have seen that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, cleansing with scissors, and ligature with thread, has shown me a good experiment; because scissors are proportionate to the incision; because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore, when you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a compression is made in a similar shape, containing the skin of the penis on all sides, with which no error falls at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper method of operation is, that you cause the boy, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, to be aware that you do not do anything except tie a thread on his penis; and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be joyful in every way possible to you, from that which he receives with his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not be seated; and hide the scissors in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy sees them not at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then introduce your hand to his penis, and blow into the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from the filth that collects on it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards tie a second ligature a little below that.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold the lower ligature's place with your index finger and thumb, with a good grasp, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then quickly lift the skin upwards and extract the head of the rod.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then allow the blood to run slowly (for this is better) and place powder on top; and over the powder a cloth on which is spread the yolk of a hard-boiled egg in rosewater, mixed with good fresh rose oil; and leave it on top until the next day; and treat it with the remaining treatment until healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the scissors for cleaning is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt and meet; so that the nail branch does not protrude from them; and let the length of the two sharpened parts be equal to the length of the two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	However, an error in the cleaning process is: that perhaps the inner skin is entirely or partly lost at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, you should extend it from your time with your fingernail before the location becomes an abscess, and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then extract it with a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	However, if three days have passed and what is under the rod remains swollen, abscessed: then leave it until the abscess is warm and ripe, and peel it off easily, and cut it according to what is prepared for you, and beware of the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore, treat it with what consolidates wounds from the powders we have described in the treatise on powders.  And if it is cut from the skin beyond measure, and extends upwards, that will not harm it either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Concerning the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growth of flesh, and similar things to those we have mentioned in the methods of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not discharged, and you see that its retention is due to a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that he be weak and bent over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be placed upon his back, and let him extend his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and let the weak man strain his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Thus, it is forced with the neck of the bladder to expel the stone backwards: wherefore the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe on the patient, then it is necessary to administer its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, whose form is this: Let it be of silver, and let it be slender, smooth, concave like a bird's quill cannula in thinness, one and a half palms in length, to which let there be a slender cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of the urine's exit through it is that you take a doubled thread, and tie to its end wool, or tow, with a good ligature; and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with shears if any excess of wool remains, but insert it into the cannula with force, like a lever.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white; and make the patient sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and its penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and tepid water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it upwards from the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then drive the syringe inside it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has already reached the empty space; and this is not done in this order, unless because the passage, in which it travels, is one in which there is tortuosity.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out, and make the urine run through the urinary passage; and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do that until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a sore occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is collected in it, and force is applied to pour water and medicines into it: then it is done with the instrument called a Clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is, in fact, deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the hollow space, in which that which impels it is located, should be according to the amount that fills it without addition, until, when something is pulled with it, moisture is drawn out; and when it is impelled, it is expelled along with it to a distance; according to how a clepsydra works, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in naval battles.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore, when force is to project the moisture into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and pull with that which impels it upwards, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its end into the tube, as we have described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then propel the moisture with that which impels it, for that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	A fine form of clyster with which the bladder is clysterized.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver, or brass; its head should be higher, similar to a small alca, and below it a sinus into which a ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the bladder of a ram, and place in it the moisture with which you wish to clyster the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two sinuses with a strong ligature made of doubled thread; and warm that moisture a little over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the end of the clyster into the tube, afterwards grasp your hand over the bladder containing the moisture with a fitting constriction, until the weak person feels that the moisture has now reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If, however, you do not have a bladder present, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it all around its circumference.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread into those openings, as they revolve.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then assemble the circle, as a flask is assembled; after you place in it that which you wish from moistures, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	Concerning the extraction of the Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of Stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have described the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and its signs in their entirety; and I have described the stone in which operation by hand and incision is required; and this is the stone generated in the bladder properly; and that which is fixed in the urethra; and I am recounting it with clear explanation and brevity.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs is that the urine passes from the bladder like water in its subtlety; and white sand appears in it, and the afflicted person rubs their urethra, and struggles with it, and frequently has to lean over.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it rises and the anus discharges with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure is easy for children, as long as they do not reach fourteen years of age.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	However, in young people, it is moderate, in that it is between those two things: and if the stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, the cure is the opposite of that.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore, when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will extract all the faeces that are in their intestines; for it sometimes prevents the finding of the stone during the investigation.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the patient be taken with their feet, and shaken and moved downwards: so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or leap from a high place sometimes.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then have him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the entire bladder will be sloping downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and touch him from the outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then immediately proceed with a section upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If, however, it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child; or your middle finger if he is a full grown youth; and that you insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it is under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards against the place, whose section you desire; and command a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another servant to extend the testicles with his right hand upwards; and with his other hand, to remove the skin, which is beneath the testicles, in the part from the place where the section is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the Spatumile, which is of this form.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find it in that which is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock; and let the incision be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision be wide on the outside, and narrow on the inside, according to the amount that it is possible for the stone to exit from it, not being larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it exits without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that the stone has angles and edges, wherefore its exit is difficult because of it.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round, its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, to the one that has angles and edges, add in the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not exit thus, then it is necessary that you devise above it: either that you string above it with a properly shaped instrument, the extremity of which is like the Moon, which strings above the stone, and does not slip from it; or that you introduce a thin instrument with a curved extremity beneath it.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If however you cannot above it, then enlarge the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If anything from the blood overcomes you, cut it with a zegi.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If however the stones are more than one, then drive the largest first to the opening of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards drive the small one after that; and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut above it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For if one of two things happens to the sick person, either to die or to suffer constant dripping of urine, because the place is not entirely consolidated.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion until it emerges; or fashion instruments in its fracture with forceps, until you extract it bit by bit.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place over it a cloth infused with oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be seated.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then lay the sick person on their back, and do not loosen the bandage, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you have loosened it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with dyafinicon ointment, and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however in the wound a hot abscess is added, and corrosive, and similar things: such as if blood is congealed in the bladder, and the urine is prevented from flowing out: and this is recognized from the excretion of blood with the urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore, insert your finger into the wound, and extract the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply whatever is appropriate from the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the hours of the entire treatment, that you bind the two thighs, and the buttocks, on account of the medicines which are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If a small stone is in the urethra, and is stuck in it, and prevents the exit of urine: then treat it with what I have mentioned before you get to the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For often you will be spared the incision by this treatment, for I have already proven it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take a perforator of iron, whose form is this: triangular tip, pointed, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and tie the urethra below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into the urethra with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and revolve the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to pierce it, until you cause it to penetrate on the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For the urine is immediately discharged.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on that which remains of the stone from the outside of the urethra.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks itself and comes out with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If however this treatment is not prepared for you, because of something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on the urethra itself between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And a ligature of thread under the stone is not necessary unless to prevent its return to the bladder; and another ligature above, unless that when the thread is loosened after the stone's removal, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound; and for that reason it is necessary for you to elevate the skin upward when you tie the upper thread, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Concerning the extraction of a stone in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Little stone is produced in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	However, if a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is prohibited due to many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that a woman is perhaps a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or from those having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman well knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the location of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity provokes to that, then it is necessary that you take a woman physician, well knowing: and little is found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If truly you isolate her, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a skilled female midwife knowledgeable in women's matters, or a woman who indicates a part of the art in this skill:  make her present, and especially for her to do whatever you command her from the examination concerning the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, that she examine if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert a finger into her anus and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore she finds it, she should grasp it beneath her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the vagina of the sick woman, and inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand upon the bladder and compresses it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her skill, until she reaches it with the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then she should cut upon it at the point opposite the middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, grasping it underneath; and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then insert a rod over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone emerges from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that the types of stone are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For from these are the small, and the large, the smooth and the rough, the long, and the round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its kinds, so that this may be made clear to you regarding that which you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in the place of crushed zegi, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is severed.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone emerges; and do so, preparing for yourself from the instruments, which I have said in the extraction of stone in men, so that you may assist in your operation by means of them.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If, however, a flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut, then place powder over the place, and bind it with linen bandages in a fitting constriction; and do not change it; and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps, indeed, the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When, therefore, the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Concerning the incision of a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter Sixty-two.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is not, unless it is an aggregation of moisture in a white sifac, which is beneath the skin containing the testicle, and is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature prepared for it in the part of the testicle, until it is putrid: which is another testicle, and is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we said: and this does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this hernia, indeed, is from the weakness that happens to the testicles: therefore this matter is poured out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colours.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For either its color is inclined to yellowness, or it is blood-red, or foul, black, or watery white, and that is what is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white sifac that we mentioned, then the abscess is round, somewhat elongated like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in the proper tissue to itself, then the abscess is round like a part of an egg, and therefore a man estimates that it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the senses.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Therefore, when you desire knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the introduced square, whose form preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Therefore, according to that which emerges in the track of the Intromission, judge about that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	Therefore, when we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you order the sick person to be bled if it is possible for him, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then let him lie on his back upon a slightly raised surface, and place many cloths beneath him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you on his left side, and order the attendant to sit on his right, who shall extend his rod towards one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part of the navel of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, until near the pubic bone; and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac that encloses it: and scrape it and observe it, or beware of this, that you separate it: and let your scraping with which you scrape it, be from the part that hangs with the more egg; and subtly scrutinize it with your scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the sifac full of water with a large perforation, and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles that encompasses it: and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either with its entirety, or in pieces, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not meticulously investigate, security is not achieved in its incision, lest the water return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If, however, the egg protrudes outward from its skin during your operation: then, when you have completed the incision of the sifac, return it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the scrotal skin with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it like the other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a corrupted egg with a different blackness, then you must tie the vessels that are the suspensory ligaments, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and remove the egg; afterward treat it with what we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If, however, water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore, cut the other part in the same way you did to the other one, equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is made equal for you, so that it is one operation, then do it; afterward wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the sections wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside wool that you soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the belly's wound; and place over it doubled cloths, and they are pillows; and tie them above with a ligament, which has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness; and let the edges with which it is pressed be made of cotton or damp wool; and let them be gathered with a constriction at the lumbar region of the breeches; and one edge shall take hold above the anus as far as the back, and the second edge shall take hold at the side of the pubic region; and two edges above the two thighs below, and two other edges above the two groins, and let the entire constriction be gathered in the lumbar region of the breeches.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of the incision with iron: and it is that you should take a small, knife-like cautery, and with it cut the skin of the testicles; and it is ignited, as we have described; until, when a white, water-containing substance is revealed, then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It resembles a Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with it, and let it be ignited, until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then spread the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated fine cautery, and cut it as much as possible, until you eradicate the whole of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And be careful, from the egg, lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and farther from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	However, if it presents opposition to you at the time of incision, or at the time of cautery a hot abscess, or blood flow, or anything else: then you must treat whatever causes opposition to you from it with the treatment that suits it, according to what has been stated.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	However, if the patient is timid and does not await this operation, due to its horror: then administer the perforation as I describe it; and it is so.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you by what we have said concerning signs that the ramex is watery, then you must have the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then perforate the abscess in its lower part with a broad spatule, and make the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a poultice on the location, and bandage it, and allow it to run out the remaining water; then treat it until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is an obstruction to the outflow of water at the hour when you perforate it; and this is only because a white pannus obstructs the wound's opening and hinders the exit of the water: then it is necessary to insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of hydrops is extracted, the form of which has preceded; or add a little to the wound's operation.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or about that.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it therefore collects, then let it be perforated in the same manner, and the sick person will pass their days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Concerning the treatment of fleshy Ramicis.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the section above this Ramic, there is fear leading to harm in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me that its dismissal is to be saved from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am recalling the operation in it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say, therefore, that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and that is produced from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute or acrid superfluity, which is poured out to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and it is a serious abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it arises from the knotting of arteries and their inflation, as its recollection has already preceded; or from the inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore, that which arises from the inflation of arteries is recognized by the disposition of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And you should not touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	However, that which arises from the inflation of veins, nothing is dispersed from it upon compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is now possible that a section be made upon this species and upon the rest of the flesh; and it is as if you were to separate the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then raise the egg upwards and draw it out with a white sifach; and free the suspensorium from the vessels, and tie the vessels; and cut the suspensorium after you have freed it from all parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the egg is consolidated with those nascent flesh parts, then it is necessary to draw out the egg, and to cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between something of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion, and to cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however there is a nativity of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it and draw out the egg, as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Concerning the treatment of Ramicis, which is with Vite.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter Sixty-four.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Vitis is an abscess enveloped in a certain wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with a softening of the testicles; and it makes difficult for the sick person movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded, as remembered.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary that we should say the operation in it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push down the suspensory ligament of the testicles.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels that are close to the penis; and let another attendant hold them, and stretch them with a forceful extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then, with a broad, sharp scalpel, make a transverse incision directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape away from every side, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then insert a needle with a double thread into them, and tie it in the first of the places where the veins occur; and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut it in the middle, in a straight section along the length of the body, and extract what is collected from the putrid, foul humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which the force generates pus, so that the vessels nourishing one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For there is no evil through it.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	However, if all the vessels are affected, then it is necessary that the testicles, with the vessels, be removed; so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment, because of the incision, and it withers or dries up, and there is no benefit with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Concerning the treatment of intestinal colic.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The outcome of this colic is from a section, which occurs in a sifach extended over the abdomen in the groin area from a mirach of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from a sifach, or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And a sign, when it is from the extension of a sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal towards the depth; because the sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And a sign of it, when it is from a section of the sifach, because it makes a severe pain occur suddenly at its beginning: and the abscess is diverse, appearing under the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course outwards from the sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it emerges with the intestine in a circle; and this is called a ramified intestine, and zirbia; and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes faeces run into the intestine and are retained there: and this is a harm to the sick person, because it causes a dull pain, and especially when pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these types of illnesses, there is fear with iron; therefore, a fall must be avoided in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is that you should instruct the sick person to draw back the intestine with their hand into the interior cavity of their body, if it yields to the withdrawal.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then he should be laid back on his neck between your hands, and elevate his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin upward, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely lengthwise.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be according to the amount, that it may be possible for the egg to emerge from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is exposed on every side; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and detach with it the adhesion that is on the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand the skin of the testicles inward; and with this, extend the white siphak upward with your left hand; and elevate the egg with the siphak towards the incision; and order the servant to extend the egg upward; and you sever the adhesion, which is behind the complete separation.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And examine with your fingers that there is nothing there of the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however you find something of it: then push it towards the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle, in which is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads; and insert it at the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision; then cut the ends that protrude from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then place some of them over some with a figure that is in the form of a cross; and bind with them the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligament, until no vessels, which nourish them, can send anything to them; so that a hot abscess does not result from it.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another ligament outside the first ligament, distant from it by no more than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligaments, leave from the siphak, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger; and cut the rest entirely around, and remove the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut into the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which blood and pus runs, as we described in what has gone before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound; and apply the bandage that we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white siphak that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If however its falling is delayed, then it should be soaked with hot water; and place upon it what we said, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the rest of the wound treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	Concerning the windy ram.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this ram, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron for its treatment.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first ones said that it happens as we have described in the ram with the vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, tie the vessels after the incision, then cut in the middle, and finally treat with whatever opens it until the vessels fall out; and treat the wound as we described until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Concerning the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the area bulges, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if it does descend, it is little and returns every hour; but if the time with it is prolonged, a fissure is added in the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that happens from the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the groin, as we said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is because the scrotum is stretched; then the area softens and becomes an abscess, and bulges.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as its preceding description.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is cured with an iron, according to this method: and it is that the sick person lies on their back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the place of the ulcerated and bulging rupture, cutting across its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then press the scrotum and what is under the skin, until when the white scrotum is exposed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a rod, and place it upon the bulging place of the scrotum, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew the two bulging places on the end of the rod from the scrotum, and connect one of them to the other with a suture; then pull out the end of the rod.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, just as I have made you know in the treatment of the intestinal hernia.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the scrotum contracts, and no bulge of the rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cautery is better in this place, since it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because of which the flesh that is between them is softened, and its appearance is disfigured.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for whoever is asked to treat it, to have the sick man lie on his back, and to cut all the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he should bring together the two lips with sutures: and if you wish, first sew up the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and secure the suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat the remaining wounds with care until they heal and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	Concerning Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is forbidden in our law; and because of that, I might not have mentioned it in this book of mine; and its mention is not necessary unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when questioned about it, and so that he may know the treatment of whoever has it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is that we often require the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, goats, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore, I say that castration is done according to two methods.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by fissure and incision.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and loosen and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer visible to the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by fissure and incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut above each testicle with one incision, until two testicles are exposed; then cut them after you have peeled back each, and do not leave any sifak on them apart from the thin sifak that is above the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves some part of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, there are two methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from men in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of these is that, as it appears, there is a space following, or in the skin of the testicles, in the space between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine runs from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one kind, and it is a woman's vulva upon the pubis like very small male testicles protruding outwardly; of which one is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three kinds, two from men, and one kind from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until their impression disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them with the treatment of the other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second kind of men, however, from which urine issues, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the incision of the labia, and the protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The labia may perhaps be added to the natural condition until its appearance becomes ugly and foul; and sometimes in some women it becomes so large that it spreads out like in men and reaches the point of sexual intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, you should hold back the excess of the labia with your hand, or with a hook, and make an incision; and do not cut too deeply, especially into the root; so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, the flesh that grows is flesh that arises in the opening of the womb until it fills it; and perhaps it emerges outwardly in the likeness of a tail; and for that reason, some earlier writers call the illness the "tailed illness.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut it as we cut the labia, and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Concerning the treatment of the Alratica, which is the unpierced vulva of a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is when a woman's vulva is not perforated, or the opening is small.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from an illness that preceded it; indeed, it is made either from added flesh growth, or by a subtle or thick sifach; and it is made either deep within the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper or lower part; and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And its recognition is made through the obstetrician's observation, if an apparent obstruction is nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the obstruction is from a thin sifach, and is close to the two lips: then hurry, and break it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you place pads on the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with strength, until the thin sifach is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the location: and let the woman do this every day, so that the location does not solidify again.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a spatula wide similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If however the obstruction is born of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that assuage the flow of blood without mordication, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not heal quickly, keep it for a few days: and administer a linen bandage, then proceed with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes other flesh births occur in the womb: therefore, it is necessary that they be cut in this way: while it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess in the womb, there should be no opposition with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and red Bothor in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of the veins' orifices, until a lot of blood flows from them constantly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil; and I have already stated their species and signs in the division; and I will state here which receive treatment from them and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no treatment with iron for them.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	However, those of them which are in the orifice of the womb upon which the senses fall, are those which are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cool house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the thelil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over them, at the flow of blood from one of the incisions, without chewing: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then let him propel her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and quince bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, make cupping vessels adhere to her back and under her arms, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and apply it to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the abscess subsides, then treat the area with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth is indeed red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, you should cut away what appears from it, according to what I said in the thelil equally, and treat it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Concerning the perforation of the exit that occurs in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and abrasions, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already discussed all these ailments and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary to describe in this treatise the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with an iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary to consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with its percussion, and inflammation, and fever: and you see it red: if the sensation falls upon it, then do not hasten with its perforation: and treat it with that which helps in its maturation, until when the sharpness of the occurrences subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary to have the woman sit on a seat that slopes two seats, and to lean, or lie down on her back, and to draw her feet to the lower part of her abdomen: and let her thighs be spread out, and let her place her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary, when you wish to administer this instrument, to fix it with the rod deep within the woman's womb: so that that which enters from the instrument is no more than the depth of the womb, and does not harm the weak one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	However, if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions upon the tissue of the womb's depth: so that the entire instrument's entry into the womb's depth may be prevented: and it is necessary that he place the rotation, which runs on the instrument, from the upper side; and that he hold the instrument, and that the minister rotate the rotation, until the womb's depth is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by the hand, and is smooth and soft, then it is necessary to separate it at its head with a wide spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and place the cloth, and extract the section into the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally over the womb, and over the pubis, clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then treat it after two days with the ointment that suits it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is flushed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, rather treat it with what we said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Teachings on Midwifery, how living embryos are treated, having emerged in a non-natural form.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXX.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to first know the form of natural childbirth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, among its signs is this: when you see a woman pressing downwards, desiring to smell the air, and relief is upon her regarding the birth, and the embryo's exit is hurried: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is upon her head, and the afterbirth with it: either hanging or suspended from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her abdomen be compressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends upon her head, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed from those superfluities by good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	However, any birth besides this one is unnatural, blameworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet, and its hands together, or one foot: or its head and hand emerge: or the belly emerges: and perhaps it turns upon its neck, and similar things are among the blameworthy figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every form among them, and how the skill is in it, and how it is signified by it, and how to stand upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges upon its head in its natural emergence, and it becomes violent upon the woman, and her labor becomes difficult, and you see her strength already weakened: then have her sit on a seat, or let women hold her; and apply vapors to her vulva with decocted fenugreek and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and split the afterbirth with it, and cut it with her nail until that which is within it runs out from the moisture; and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If, however, it does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be cleansed with a clyster of fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then prescribe to her after the clyster that she compress herself; and make her sneeze with condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will emerge immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If, however, two hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary that you reduce them with ease gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If, however, it does not yield during entry, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upwards; then shake the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If, therefore, the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies: then cut them, and remove the remaining fetus; and tie its hand with cloth, and extract it with equality; for it will emerge.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo is upon its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges upon its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards, equalize it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When, therefore, they emerge up to the hips, then command it to be compressed, and make it sneeze with condiments; for it will emerge, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not emerge with what we have described, then return the fetus gradually until you place it in its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will then emerge with easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is prevented by all that we have described, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum, and pound all in a mortar with a good pounding.  Then line with it the vulva of the woman and the lower part of her belly.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she experiences hypocondria.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that her lower parts are already heated, then make her a poultice of myrrh, and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore the poultice has held for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze, and pinch her nose and mouth, and press the lower part of her belly with gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the pus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus is upon the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it emerges in this manner, then gently insert her hands into it.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman shall lie on her back with her feet hanging down, lying on the bed, and her hands folded.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gently on her abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then pull out what is under her feet from the pillows until it is prepared at the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a forceful motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press gently on what is above the hypochondria until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then let her insert her hands, and gently adjust the fetus; and instruct the woman to compress until the fetus emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hangs sideways from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Her hand should be skillfully employed in the reduction.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however she cannot reduce it, then lift the woman, and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If, however, she cannot walk, then have her lie on a bed and shake her legs with a forceful shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment which you prepared from mucilaginous substances.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If childbirth takes it (the pain), then have her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and arrange the fetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself, until it emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus is upon her neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is towards its mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife should hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it and arrange it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is thus arranged, then place upon its vulva what we have described, of oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command her to move gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then have her sit on a seat, and command her to lean to her right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command her to be compressed; and make her sneeze with condiments.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the opening of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inward, until you place it as it ought to be: and command the woman to compress herself several times: for it will exit with an easy exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three, and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	However, five is a thing beyond nature, and they do not entirely live: and a single afterbirth contains them, although they multiply, and they are separated by a partition, distinguishing them, tied to the umbilical cord of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they emerge just as a single fetus emerges by a natural, easy exit, and they emerge by that praiseworthy exit, as we have narrated.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult at birth, and reach that which we have said of unnatural shapes, then treat them as we have narrated; and let the midwife be subtle, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and devise according to every shape with that which is prepared for her from ingenuity leading to health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A reminder of what is formed in the womb from embryos, and miscarriages.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has already been verified by me that a woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	For perhaps a similar case will come to her: therefore, let her oppose it with that which is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division of medicine, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then it is necessary that you consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If then the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted by any of the accidents from which harm is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid supine on a bed, on her back, and her head lowered, and her legs raised; and let the attendant hold her by two sides, or let her be bound to the bed, so that her body is not moved during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the womb with humid oils, with the mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then let her introduce it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then let her seek with it the place where she can fix the hooks on the fetus, and suitable places for this.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in places near the ribs, and under the hypochondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubic bone and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand, and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of her left hand, and introduce it with her hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places which we have mentioned, until she reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she should fix another, or a third hook, if necessary, opposite it, so that there is equal contraction, and it does not deviate to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not only be in a straight line, but rather be moved in every direction, so that its exit is eased; just as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary for that which is between them to be softened by the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part of it remains, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil, and insert them from the side, so that she may turn with them that which remains.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks should be moved to another place that is higher; do this until the entire fetus emerges.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore a hand emerges before the other, and it is not possible to return it, because of its constriction, then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it out until when the entire one emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow; and thus it is necessary that you do to the other hand, and to the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the fetus's head is large, or constriction occurs in its exit, or water has accumulated in its head: then it is necessary to insert a thorny Spatumile between the fingers, and to split the head with it, and to extract the water; or to break it with the instrument called Almisdac: whose shape comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter that is after this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, he should do so if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary to sever it with algengematu, or to extract it with misdach, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head emerges, and is constricted at the fork, then it is to be split, until the moisture that is in the chest is discharged.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If, however, it is not entangled, nor yields to exit: then cut the head into pieces, as much as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If, however, the lower belly has an abscess, or has dropsy in it: then it is necessary to pierce it, until moisture runs from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If, however, the fetus is above its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is slight.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If, however, it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and to split the belly or chest until that which is in them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If, however, the rest of the limbs are removed, and the head returns: then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the womb, and search for the head with it, and pull it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb: then insert one or two hooks into it and pull it with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If, however, the mouth of the womb is constricted, because of a hot abscess that has occurred to it: then it is not necessary to work on it, but rather it is necessary then to administer the effusion of humid, fatty things; and to administer plasters; and to sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to equalize it: then let what we said about a living fetus be administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we said about hot abscesses which occur in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If a flow of blood occurs, then let it descend into astringent waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed I have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: then she became pregnant over it again, afterwards another fetus died as well.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, a long time after, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	Therefore, I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore, I placed over it some plasters of strong attraction: and a bone came out from the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was therefore surprised by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I therefore thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I then searched for the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in her best condition; and she thus lived a long time, and emitted a little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I have not established this extraneous thing here, unless because there is knowledge and aid in it for the work that a skillful physician manages with his healing hand.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Concerning the shapes of the necessary instruments in the extraction of a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the shape of the Forceps, by which books are equalized, to which are equally two pivots at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this pivot ought to be finer than the forceps; and so that it is made, either of ebony or of boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each piece of wood is about two fingers; and the edge of each of them is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are now fixed to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are introduced into the opening of the womb, so that it may be opened with them when you turn the two pivots.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Shape of the pivot by which the womb is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form, similar to that one, finer, and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is about a handspan: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When therefore you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, and the space between her legs open.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two joined additions into the womb: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with shears, equally according to the amount you wish of the opening of the mouth of the womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Another form of Vertigo, which the ancients called the Impelling Form, by which the fetus is impelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The Almisdac form, by which the large head is crushed; and it is likened to a pair of tongs, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it becomes elongated, like tongs according to this form, as you see, which have teeth like saw teeth, by which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The Almisdac form by which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of a hook having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of a hook having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps with saw teeth, with which the fetal head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of a spatula with two ends for severing the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two spatulas, also broad.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used, and the more their types are multiplied, and they are prepared by the craftsman, the swifter is his operation and the higher he is esteemed among men because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not despise any instrument from among them without having it prepared.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Concerning the extraction of the Secundine.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Secundine is retained at birth, then it is necessary to instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then cause her to sneeze with spices: and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it emerges by this means, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid: and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, asafoetida, cinnamon wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed tube over the hole of the pot's lid, and the other end in the mouth of the womb: and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then cause her to sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this treatment, and does not emerge: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then let her insert it into the vagina, and search for the Afterbirth with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she finds it, then let her take it, and extend it gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it be attached deep within the womb, then let her insert her hand, according to what we have described, until when she finds the Afterbirth, and pull it out gradually in a straight line, so that the womb does not fall during the violent pull; rather, it must be shifted easily to the right and left sides; then let the amount of pull be increased.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it then yields, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing and by medicine of a pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If, however, it does not emerge with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself out in repeated extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that what emerges from it to the mouth of the womb be tied to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then administer an enema to her with the four-drug ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve, and it will emerge.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it putrefies, a bad odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients have already experienced fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	Form of the instrument with which to fumigate a woman in retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made of glass similar to alabaster, or of earthenware: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed over the prunus: let it hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and again another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Concerning the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born with their anuses unperforated, which a fine sifac has already obstructed.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that sifac with her finger; and if not, to pierce it with a sharp spatula; and let her be careful not to touch the flesh.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If, however, you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to evacuate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now, obstruction of the anus also happens from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it is necessary that that consolidation be cut, then treated with what we said concerning treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the treatment of Fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter Eighty.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are swellings and enlargements that occur near the anus externally, or in the space of one of the parts: and it is one fistula, or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that swelling has become old, it opens, and watery white moisture, or thin pus, runs from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes there are penetrating fistulas from these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, penetrating ones are recognized by that which emerges from excretion and windiness, when the sick person uses excretion: and perhaps worms emerge from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And some of them are fistulas when, being penetrating, they are in the space leading to the bladder, and to the urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And some of them are penetrating as far as the hip joint, and as far as the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	By this, however, a penetrating fistula to the anus is recognized, even from a non-penetrating one, that you insert your index finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe into the fistula, from air or iron; when there is no winding.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is winding in it, then insert into it a thin probe of lead, or a hair from a horse's mane, until you feel the probe or hair in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it completely, and nothing emerges from the opening in terms of expulsion, nor wind, nor worm as I said, then know that it is not penetrating; therefore, hasten to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder, or to the urinary meatus, then its indication is the discharge of urine from it, and its prevention from this that the place be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If however it is penetrating to the hip joint, or to the hip bone, then its sign is that the probe reaches that place, if there is no winding to the bone; and the discovery of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus emerges from it always; and that no medication works on it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas, there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labor and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	However, in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I tell you, and I have already proven; and it is that the sick person lies on their back in your hands; and raise their legs above their hips, and their hips are inclined toward their stomach.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is a winding in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the sick person feels it around the anus, then you should introduce your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If therefore you feel the probe has already penetrated itself, detected, beyond what you feel between your finger and the fistula, or flesh: then you know for certain that it is penetrating; therefore do not labor on it, for there is no cure for it, as we said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	However, they say that in some people the flesh heals, and from the medication from which they hope for help, it is that you heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as before, and introduce it heated into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat it twice or three times, until you know that all those added filtered flesh that are like the hollow quill of a bird are already burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those burned flesh come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if the probe emerges, and does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the probe, or if such a thing happens, and you see a fistula in what follows the skin surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting along with the probe that is in the fistula, until the cut reaches where the probe's end reaches, and the probe is released and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered tissues, which resemble the hollow of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	However, if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation as you cut those tissues, then it is better, and more quickly helpful, to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because cautery with fire gathers good qualities, to burn those added tissues, and to cut off blood, and to dry out the moistnesses.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with bandages soaked in butter, or with crushed herbs, until the place discharges pus, and those burned tissues are discharged in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which produce hard flesh: and there are medicines in which are astringency and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear a recurrence.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and extends from the body's superfluity: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a tension, and between you and it is a veil of sinew or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation on it, except according to the path of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because one of three ways is administered in it: either to cauterize it itself, as we said: or to dissect it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert ligatures, and a cure from close by.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed far with the section, so that you do not cut the muscle containing the anus, and cause a sudden exit of excrement from the sick without their will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed. Or you will extend the veil and cleanse it after you have cut it close to the anus, as we said, either with a probe or with another instrument with a sharp end.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered tissues that are in the section, until you can reach it with exploration.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision and the upper opening where it consolidates; and a fistula will remain open in the interior part of the anus, and it will be less severe on the sick person.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this way: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and the margin of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like an alef needle, that is, for preparing skins, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wrapped with five threads, and so on.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If, therefore, it penetrates the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening; so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together; and tighten each, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, the more tightly you should tighten it, until those parts of flesh between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall off; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not in your power to do that for fear of injuring it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	Shape the pointed spatula with which the fistula is cut, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter Eighty-one.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For they are either inside the anus, like the bladders of carbon, or of prunes: or as if they were themselves grapes.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them are small, and large: and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those which are outside the anus, are for the most part few in moisture, from which flows yellow water, or little blood with continuous flow: and they are according to the colour of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you command the sick person to sit; and it is squeezed, until it emerges from the anus, and the athelil appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, also suspend them with hooks: or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If, however, the hooks are not retained in them, because of their moisture and their softening: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a cloth from double-layered wool, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them and, after the incision, sprinkle some hot powders over them, so that they will stand in place of a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what has preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not yield to expulsion, then inject the sick person with an enema containing a small amount of mordication, so that it washes away what is in the anus, and yields to expulsion quickly, when the sick person expels it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If, however, the piles are external to the anus, then their removal is easy; and it is to grasp them with your fingernail, or grasp them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever shuns incision with iron, then it is necessary to treat their sutures in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a wrapped thread, and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull the pile upward, and cause it to penetrate with the needle at its root on the other side; and wrap the two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and let them be lengthwise; and bind the pile with a strong constriction.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the piles, and leave one of them; nor tie it, so that superfluity of blood may run from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in rose or cedar oil over the anus, and place it over the anus; and command the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and the other treatment, until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Concerning the treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Indeed, they often occur from the drying of the stool and constriction of the nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become old and medicine is of no avail in them, then it is necessary that you scrape them with a pointed spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper crust that prevents their consolidation is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them until they are consolidated as is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If however they do not consolidate, then scrape them again with a more forceful instrument than the first, until they bleed much, and are excoriated, then treat them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmars, and of dry athelils, and of ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that an Almirmar is nothing other than a round swelling the colour of the body, similar to the head of a nail, and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes, and pain arises from them when walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut what is around the nail, and to hold it with scissors, or with a hook, and to uproot it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it, and if you wish, cauterize it according to what was stated in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From dry athelil, one is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they frequently occur on the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is to extend the athelil and cut it; or to bind it with silk thread; or with a hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been previously stated with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now inverted athelil are eradicated, and not inverted with the instrument that I shall name.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A formica, however, is also a small, filtered, thick eminence above the body's surface, penetrating deeply; and when cold finds it, a sensation similar to an ant bite is felt in it, and it spreads throughout the body; and most of it occurs on the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is to take a cannula from a goose's feather, or a strong vulture's feather; and to place that cannula over the Formica until the cannula's circle contains its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the cannula until you sever what is around the Formica; and place it into the depths of the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air, or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the cannula's top be at a height that pulls the enclosed part upward, so that the grasping and turning of it and itself might be lightened.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what was previously stated in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Concerning the forms of instruments administered for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for bowel evacuation, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter Eighty-three.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or of bronze, or of cast brass, or of hammered brass.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made from these instruments, small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of young children should be small; and likewise their enemas, for those whose anuses are weak or painful.
Clistere magnum.	Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its tube, that is, the upper end where the bag is tied, should be wide in this manner; and it should have a distinction so that the bag is tied as you see, and its lower end, which is inserted into the anus, should be closed, that is, not open, smooth, very much so, drawn to a thinness; and on one side of it should be two openings, and on the other side one opening.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the size of the opening should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker; and the bag, in which the medicines are placed, should be of an animal bladder, or of parchment, which should be according to the shape of a small asofrat, the root of which is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be pierced with many holes as it is rolled, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert a strong thread, made of ten threads or so, through those holes, and attach the bag to it like an asofrat.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When the bag is thus placed in it, the top of the enema should be tightened between two distinguishing constrictions with a strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then irrigate with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the shape of the bag depicted here, and of the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The method of irrigation with it is: fill the bag, or bladder, with medicine that has been heated according to the patient's tolerance; and beware that it is not overly hot or overly cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the patient should lie on their back, and raise their legs upwards; and place a cushion beneath them, that is, a hide upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the tip of the enema with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant grasp the bag with both hands simultaneously, and express it with force, until everything in the enema is evacuated into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the enema, and let the patient raise their legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine compels him to an outcome, then let him hold it as long as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If, however, you administer an enema for ailments of loose bowels, and its exit is hasty, then administer an enema again, until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or damaging abscesses in the anus, then let the enema be very thin, gentle, from enemas with which children are enematized.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a thin enema, above which the skin should be tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	Concerning the treatment of head wounds without a bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds that it was suitable for the book, and I will now describe their treatment with the hand, and with medicines, according to its completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore, I say that wounds are diversified according to the means by which they are made, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things by which wounds are often made are, like the throwing of a stone; or the incision of a sword, or a knife; or the impact with a spear, or wood, or an arrow; and by similar things from many such.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	And the wounds that are made according to the places of the body are, like the wound that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver; and similar ones from those members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, that I may set forth the reasoning and rule concerning the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the recounting of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from a stone's throw or similar things, and has only broken the skin: and is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately; and do not delay it; and draw from his blood according to the amount of his strength: if nothing forbids it from the phlebotomy, especially if the blood that emerges from the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person beware of repletion, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If however something prevents diminution, then let the food be lessened, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And if a hot abscess happens to him, apply a poultice soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine that contains astringency, over the wound.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If however you are certain of the absence of a hot abscess, then apply, if it is recent with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder I will describe shortly; and if the air has already changed it, then apply certain ointments until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If however the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things; and its lips do not come together by means of pledgets, then bring them together with stitches, according to what I will describe regarding the sutures of belly wounds.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If however the wound is already exposed to the bone, and hangs, and its retention is only in a small suspensory, then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore the hard flesh in place of the skin, and instruct the sick person to eat foods with bulk, such as heads of grain, and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulp; and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the putrefied part, and cast it out; then treat it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows; and it is not stopped by remedies, then investigate the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not severed, then cut it with a Spatumili, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity compels when that which we have said does not help, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however these wounds are small, simple, then their treatment is easy, light; so that you powder over them this powder, because it consolidates them before air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of the flesh-producing powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: thoroughly grind the whole, and sift it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it tightly with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it from above with bandages, and leave it, and do not unbind it while it remains, so that it does not fester.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes lime alone does it, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood present, and the latter also performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is appropriate to put it on them and bind them, and are fresh wounds with their own blood, which air has not altered.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If it has already been altered by some alteration of the air, especially when it is summer, then the application of this powder is not effective. Therefore, treat it with what we have said, by applying some digestive ointments to it, or place poultices of barley flour, made with water and honey, until it discharges pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	However, if a fracture occurs with a bone wound, and it is small, then extract it with forceps; and I will now describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Concerning wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter Eighty-five.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	However, if a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple head wound.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	However, if the nerve of the neck, or artery, has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except that its treatment should be avoided, along with anything that creates strong astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that by which it is treated be gentle, such as lime washed with sweet water, infused with oil sometimes, or with rose oil, and tuttia, when washed also with sweet water; and the remaining mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If however the wound is large, then administer a suture: or narrow its edges with pledgets.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If however the wound has depth, or there occurs a sinus in its lower part, in which pus is already collected, then pierce it in the more depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If indeed an artery has been cut in the wound, and its blood flow has resulted, then separate or cut it, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity prompts it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If however the windpipe has been cut, or the entire one, and the other parts have been saved, then join the skin edges with a suture over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe, rather straighten it, and bring it back to its natural form.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments containing astringency and desiccation, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If however the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then investigate it: then if there are bone fragments within it, extract all or as many as you can of them: and what cannot be removed, leave it, until the wound rots, and its discharge is separated and relieved.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then powder over it the powder I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If however bone is seen in the wound, and it becomes a fistula, then treat it with what is recounted in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Concerning wounds in the shoulder blades.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter Eighty-Six.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a blow from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore wind issues from the wound, when the sick person gasps from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	But if it is not deep, and is fresh with its own blood, then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the sick person; but put attracting ointment on it and loosen it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If however the ointment is not present for you, then put an old cloth in the wound opening, so that it will suck that which emerges from it of the humors; and make the sick person sleep over the wound, so that that which is gathered in it may run.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	However, if three days or more have already passed since the wound, and no spasm has occurred in the sick person, nor bad heart tremor, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the rest of their condition good, then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it with bandages and the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If however its healing is excused, and it continually opens, then know that it has now become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore treat it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from the incision of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what preceded regarding sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	If however it has already made an impression on the bone, and chipped pieces from it: then investigate the wound, and hasten to extract those pieces, if they are detached.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If however they are not detached, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for the extraction of them will be alleviated.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	However, the treatment of other accidental wounds in other limbs is judged by the judgment that we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their expulsion.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture which occurs in the belly is great, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From the great one, therefore, sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, their introduction, and their more vehement and difficult suturing, occurs.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore it follows, that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten their introduction to their place immediately, since it is inflated, opened, and thickened: therefore its entrance becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	For this reason, therefore, the middle rupture of ruptures is better, because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suturing of the belly is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two sutures common to the suturing of the belly and the suturing of the other wounds of the body, and two other sutures properly belong to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more properly associated with the suturing of the belly, and I will describe each with explanation and clarification.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine protrudes from it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it, then that is due to one of two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said, or because there is inflation in the intestine due to the cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	Therefore, when this is so, then it is necessary to warm it, just as you would immerse a sponge or a damp cloth in lukewarm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with squinancy, cyperus, and spike, and apply it to the intestine with it until the inflation resolves.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes wine with astringency does this, and it is better than plain water in resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by that, its entrance is eased with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than the incision; and no coercion is made to cut after necessity and instrument failure.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let the slender extremity not be with the slenderness of a spatula, but rather somewhat blunter: and it is that which is similar to a cabbage leaf, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	Therefore, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible over it; because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When, however, the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your attention and your consideration always on this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary that you administer it in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have a pious attendant present between your hands, who should hold the entire rupture with his hand, and draw together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover from it for the one who follows the suture something after something: and this is the common method of a single suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is that you should take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's breadth.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then release from the extremity of the rupture a quantity of the ring finger, that is, the physician's: and fix one needle past that into which you insert thread at both ends of the skin, with the two ends of it (the thread) being what is under the skin from the insides, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side, and you have already brought together the two extremities of the skin, and the two ends of it (the thread): and four rows are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with a double thread in the circumference of the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are brought together in a decent aggregation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then release the thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterward, thread it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease to do that with the needles you need until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be intermediate in thickness and thinness; because very thin needles pierce flesh very quickly, and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin; for that reason, they ought to be intermediate in thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary that the needle be fixed in the two close extremities of the skin very much, so that the flesh is not pierced quickly and the wound opened before it is consolidated, and also not to be extended too far with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the sick person in their sleep; and place cushions of cloth on every side, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of suture with needles is indeed more suitable in small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because one, or two, or approximately that number of needles is sufficient for their suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	However, the second common suture is to gather together with the suture four extremities: two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of the stuff, at once, with a needle in which is wrapped a thread equal in thinness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you have pierced with the needle these four extremities, withdraw the needle from the side from which you began, in the same way, so that the thread drawn back falls from the upper part of the wound; so that there is a suture, like a suture of cloth with which cloths are tied together, and place between each suture an amount of thickness less than a little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	However, men know this suture.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I sewed up a wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound rupture was greater than one palm: and approximately two palms of the middle intestine had come out, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore I returned it after his intestine had stood outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	Therefore the wound was consolidated in a space of approximately fifteen days: and I cured him, and he was healed; and he lived after that many years, engaged in his affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that it would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was miraculous that I did not cure it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where no ointment, nor anything of the medicaments, was to be found.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Therefore I placed an old linen cloth over the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will now describe two specific types of sutures, according to the account of the text.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and introduce the needle from the exterior to the interior part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and going into the muscle, along the length and breadth of the entire body: leave the extremity thus on the side in which you inserted the needle, and cause it to penetrate on the other extremity from the interior part to the exterior on the other extremity mirach.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have caused it to penetrate, then cause it to penetrate according to this on the same extremity mirach from the exterior part to the interior: and leave the extremity sifac, which is on this side, and cause the needle to penetrate the other extremity from the interior part to the exterior: and cause it to penetrate with your penetration, in which you cause it to penetrate on the sifac extremity mirach, which is on its part, until it penetrates the whole thing.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the extremity, which is from sifac on the other side, and draw the needle out of the skin which it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce it into that skin, and sew the extremity sifac, which is on the other side, with this extremity mirach: and draw it out of the skin which is from its part, and do it one time, and another: and do it turn by turn, until you have sewn the whole exterior according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that it should be like the suture of leather workers when they sew hides: so that you should sew sifac at one time from one part of one skin's extremity: and that you should leave it at another time from another part, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	Second species of proper suture, which Galen said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	His discourse recounts that one should sew it according to the likeness in which certain physicians sew them, in such a way that they gather every part to its suitable counterpart by nature: and they apply the extremity sifac to its other extremity, and the extremity mirach to its other extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	One must place the needle in the extremity of mirach nearest to you from the outer side, and cause it to penetrate to the inner part in that alone; and leave the two extremities of sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle, and cause it to penetrate from the outer to the inner side in the two extremities of sifac, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both, also causing both to penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other extremities of mirach, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and is a suture whose remembrance precedes.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the speech of Galen also.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, introduce one thread into each of them: and begin with the introduction of the needle, from where it is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who sew skins equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than the other places of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the treatment of a wound, is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, when you obtain a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you replace the intestines, and adjust them, and adapt them, then place it on the incarnative powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the wound, then place upon it certain ointments, which are present to you, until they produce pus; and the threads fall away, and the wound is consolidated by means of sifac, and mirach.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	However, if the medicines are not present to you, then immediately place upon it, from the moment it begins to emit pus, old lint; and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not require any other medication in many dispositions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If, however, you fear that the wound may communicate with the principal members in the injury, then it is necessary that you immerse soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the areas that are between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If, however, he feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then administer an enema to him with astringent, black, lukewarm wine; especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and has made a penetrating exit to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing; and that which is from the small intestine is of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is a zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, a space has passed it, and it has already become green, or black, then it is necessary to bind it with thread above the place which has been blackened by it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in a zirbum there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the traction of it may be alleviated upon you, and the extraction of it at the occurrence of a zirbum, and the emission of the pus of the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A recollection of the wound that occurred in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it might be restored in some people; for this reason, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a spear thrust, and there was a wound on the right side of his stomach, and it was an old wound: and it had become a fistula, and excrement and wind came out of it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I applied treatment, until I was not confident in his healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until he was healed, and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick person, lest an evil accident occur in his belly; and no such evil accident occurred to him from that.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and engaging in sexual activity, and entered a bath, and exercised in his daily activities.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some of the experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it ought to be bound in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is as if you take ants of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those which have an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore it takes hold of them, and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not detach.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the amount of the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and suture the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is nourished and healed, and no harm comes to the sick person at all.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible that the intestine be tied even with a fine thread: which has been scraped from the animal's intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is extensively scraped.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce it to the disruption.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of sewing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound which is large, extensive, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no remedy but refinement, nor is its healing complete.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Concerning the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that any wound, or abscess, when it grows old and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and constantly discharges pus, and is not cut off: then it is universally called a fistula, wherever in the body it is, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula, in truth, is a filtered, hard, white knot, with no pain, having the hollow cavity of a bird's feather; and because of that, some call it Risati, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in some hours moist, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is cut off in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes it is scant; and sometimes it is thick, and sometimes it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already mentioned in the division, when I said about wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor flesh grows in it, is not so except for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its bad quality; or because between it and the edges of it is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh; or because there is much filth and dirt; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is applied to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is inappropriate for its treatment; or because the corruption descending on the region is a kind of pestilence, or by a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, in which there is a difficulty in digesting illnesses, and the healing of abscesses by nature is delayed; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones, in it.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their cures with medicines in the division: and it is necessary here to make you know the cure of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by means of surgery with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For of them are fistulas which reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs; or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joints of compound compositions, such as the hand and foot; and of them are those which go to the vicinity of the main member, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, whatever of these fistulas is of this kind, is of illnesses difficult to heal, and does not receive a cure, and dealing with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places which I have said: and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to attain knowledge of it, then take a probe of air or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and search for it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If however there is twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, with the lightness of its body, is alleviated and is bent around the twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to mark it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, irrigate it from its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture you irrigate it with, goes towards the other openings, and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then, inquire carefully in what way it is possible for you to know whether there is a bone or nerve, and the fistula cavity is distant or near; or if it is a single fistula with many openings, and stand over the entire area with all your strength; with your questioning, in which you question the sick person, and the discovery of pain upon compression with your hand on the area, and with similar signs and causes of accidents relating to abscesses.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, once you have stood over all those areas correctly, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  And consider whether the fistula is a near, apparent fistula, or in a safe place far from a joint, or a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the locations I have mentioned to you; then cut the fistula as previously described in my explanation, and remove what is within it by filtration, and the corrupted flesh, that grows in its opening from flesh, or boils, and similar things; and treat it until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	However, if the fistula is of distant, deep location, and is in a straight line, then you must cut it as deeply as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply bandages soaked in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula that you have grasped with the iron.  Do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine has consumed all that remains in the fistula cavity from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If, however, it does not heal by that, then cauterize it according to what we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is ascertained by you, then investigate it and cut it as I have told you, if nothing from a vein, nerve, or main limb prevents you, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If bone is discovered by you, and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with that which causes it to flesh over, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal, and discharges pus as it did, then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, expose it again, and meticulously perform its scraping and cleansing with all your strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it heals, well and good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a distant deep part of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore, you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the small bone is decayed, and it is possible for you, extract it with fine forceps suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If, however, there are many bones, then carefully extract all of them, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, any moisture offers resistance to you, and there is no fear or error in cutting them: then cut those moistures and flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If, however, you are not prepared to remove the bones from your time, then place over the wound something that will putrefy it, and leave it until that which is around those bones from the flesh and moistures is putrefied.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And constrict the incision that you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Indeed, place over it, if you fear it, a cloth soaked in ground sulfur mixed with oil, or a cloth soaked in Egyptian unguent, or any green unguents.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those humidities, namely, putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and extraction of them is eased.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If however there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg or the bone of the hip, and similar to them, and that which is corrupt from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If however that which is corrupt within it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it completely up to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is consolidated.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I narrate to you a case, which happened to a man in his leg: that you may set it as an example and aid in your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man about thirty years of age, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause which originated within his body, that is, from the interior, until the matter reached his leg, and it became a large abscess: and there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, time passed with the physicians' error, until the abscess was opened, and many matters ran together with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was delayed, until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus and bodily humours.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of medicine among them, until I was called, and saw his leg, and the matters that were running from those openings with great force: even the entire man's body was already wasted, and his colour was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I probed all the openings, and found them to reach each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I therefore hastened and cut over one of those openings, until I exposed a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was already gnawed, and blackened, and rotten, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore cut what was revealed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I judged that there was in the bone only that corruption which I had cut away and sawn.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried, and I discovered a second bone above the first discovery: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I sawn what appeared to me to be also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore, I again uncovered it, and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut approximately one palm's breadth from the bone, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and this repetition in its operation and section was not necessary, except because of the disposition of the weakened patient, and his/her lack of tolerance, and my fear for him/her of death: since it happened to him/her at all hours from an excess of evacuative syncopes, which were bad.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore, he/she was healed with complete healing: and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was established in his/her body, and his/her strength returned; and he/she was restored to his/her previous disposition; and no harm was done to him/her in walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If, however, a prominent bone in the body has already been fractured, then it is necessary to saw it, according to this method: and it is that you should take a ligature, and tighten it at the extremity of the prominent bone; and instruct someone to raise it upward; and place another thicker wool ligature over the first ligature.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it over the flesh which is under the bone; and extend its extremity, so as to draw the flesh downward; and you uncover the flesh over the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood, or a plank, underneath the bone below properly, because when you do this, it does not prevent the sawing of the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place a little, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone; and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compel sawing of another place.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted, and not prominent, but rather its part continues with another part; and the corruption is in its middle, or in a part of it: then uncover the flesh from all sides entirely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards saw it from the first side, where the corruption is, until the sawing continues on the other side; and let the sawing be along the length from the corruption a little, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If, however, the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it except abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the comb of the hand, or in the comb of the foot, then the matter is very difficult in it.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But you must investigate how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever remedy is rectified for you: when it does not cause you opposition from the vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many incisions and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare an instrument suitable for that operation for every type of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations show you the type of instrument you need when you have prolonged study with you.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art is a witness to the methods of illnesses: for then you will already find for yourself that which is appropriate for it from instruments for every ailment.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am establishing for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will set as examples upon which you will make incisions, and the test by which you will experiment upon others.
Forma Serrae.	Saw shape.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This saw shape depicted, be made fittingly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arch be sharpness of iron, and its handle of boxwood, and be a pyramid fittingly made.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Shape of the joints of a razor.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be, according to the shape of the head of a star-shaped nail, and its points be according to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not agree, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it, when they are corrupted, or the bone is large and great.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Shape of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Shape of the middle razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Shape of the broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Shape of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Shape of the other, slender razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Shape of the other razor with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Shape of a small, slender, taut razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Shape of the razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Shape of a large razor also.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw; it is shown in many places from the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Shape of the razor suitable for the scraping of that which is perforated from the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, with sharp edges.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made of Indian (metal).
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, it is necessary that all that we have said be made of razors, and knives, and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	Extremities putrefy, either from an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicinal remedies, and the treatment does not help; and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, to which nothing responds; then it is necessary to cut that limb as far as the corruption extends, so that the afflicted person escapes death, or a greater harm which is from the lack of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And a sign that this occurs is that the limb darkens until it stinks; that fire has burned it, or it rots after darkening; until that rot is cut away down to the healthy part of the limb, and spreads to the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, act quickly with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of some venomous creatures, such as a sea scorpion, a viper, a rattlesnake, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption, or the injury, is in the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption, so that it advances to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption, until it takes hold in the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades it, then cut off the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however the corruption passes, and you see it approximately at the elbow, then in that is the death of the weak one.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that from the cure, is a measure of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades the toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it takes hold in the arch of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If however the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except dismissal, and leaving the sick person to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting or sawing off a limb is such that you should tighten the ligament below which you want to cut, and tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the attendant extend one ligament downward, and let the attendant extend the other ligament upward.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you should separate the flesh which is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until the entire flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it should be cut or sawed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you place linen cloths on all sides, and that the saw does not touch a healthy part; and that the infirm person suffers additional injury, and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, internal bleeding occurs during your work, then cauterize the place quickly, or place some powders that stop the bleeding upon it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	Because it happened in his foot a blackness, with a burning similar to the combustion of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man hastened himself, after seeing the corruption fall upon the limb with its vehemence, which he found from its pain and burning: and it struck him at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time passed, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Therefore he came to me, and I tried to remove that excess with what I put on his hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body: and the excess was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger, until the corruption began in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	Therefore he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping from me about the repulsion of that excess: and I also feared for him at the cutting of his hand death.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the man's strength was over the case.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he therefore despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it came to me about him, that he hastened, and cut his whole hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not brought this account, unless that it may be a help concerning that which falls from the genus of this sickness: and that it may be a sign by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Concerning the treatment of Sinuses, and the quality of enemas with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the space of the abscess prolongs itself until it collects pus: then it breaks open, or is pierced, and that which is in it of pus emerges, and a hollow space remains, as if it were a vessel; and the skin which is above it is like a cloth which has already been thinned out; and it does not reach the ultimate stage in its corruption, nor does it impinge upon the mouth, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula: however, if its space is prolonged, until the corruption impinges upon any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or a zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is to cut away that entire skin, as it is rolled up; and especially when it has been thinned out, and made like a cloth; and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	However, if you hope that the skin adheres, and that corruption does not result from that ultimate consequence; and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with an enema; and it is, that you should consider the Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	If it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor, then enema it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, and combining them in a vessel; and they should be boiled over the fire until the medicine turns red; and it comes to the consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need; and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema the Sinus with it; and constrict its orifice, and leave the medicine in it for a quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then draw it out with pressure; do that for so many days, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is enemated with ashes water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is, that you should take ashes of vine wood, or ashes from holly wood, and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and enema with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the sick person does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the water of ashes, then enema him with water and honey, to which some crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or enema him with mixed honey and wine, since the property of honey is to cleanse and wash away; and wine causes the Sinus to adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the Sinus is now removed, then enema him with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is that you take from the diafinicon plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or enema him with some medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the opening of the Sinus is narrow, into which the enema cannula does not fit, then widen it a little with iron, or place in it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in Basil ointment, until it is widened.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly, if the opening is also wide, then bring together its lips with sutures, and leave in it a quantity into which the enema will enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly, if the opening from which pus runs is elevated upwards, then cut it in the lower place within it, so that pus runs from it downwards; because pus, when constricted in the depth of the Sinus, prevents flesh from growing there.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus roughly below it as you wish, then try to prepare the limb in such a way that pus runs from it easily according to how it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to prevent any pus from being retained there at all, and take consolidating medicines that are placed on a mark, appropriate to what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a size that it covers the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then, with scissors, cut a hole directly over the opening of the sinus, slightly larger than the sinus opening.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread some mild ointments onto another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it over that in a position slightly distant from the sinus opening, so that the pus from it may be alleviated; and do not remove the large cloth, unless after a few days, at one time.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	However, the one over the sinus opening is the one you remove every hour, so that what accumulates in it of pus may come out; and so that you may know whether the matter flowing from it, the virus, is much or little; or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this, again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether its master feels pain there, or if there is no pain there, and whether there is an abscess there, or if there is not an abscess there.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	Therefore, when your treatment proceeds thus, and you see the matter that emerges from the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or approaching adherence; then, therefore, loosen it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you loosen the wound, then change the cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	However, if a thin virus emerges from the sinus after a long period, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, since among people are those who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and among them are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If, however, undigested pus emerges from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If, therefore, the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its matter prolonged, then add in the drying of the medicines, but let the physicians arrange that the medicines are humid in their substance and dry in their virtue, like the unguentum dyafinicon, when superfluous addition of zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the most ultimate of its cures is that you take the unguentum dyafinicon, and let it be dissolved with rose oil, and let ancient wine be sprinkled over it equal in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it does a similar action to this, when the unguentum dyafinicon is not present for you, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then line a cloth over it, and bind it over the sinus; and line it with the honey which you boiled until it thickened; and powder spices over it, and place it over the cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of the celestial lily, and the lily, and herb flour, and centaury are administered in it.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them, simple or combined, grind them, and sieve them: and powder them over the honey which I have described, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the sinus condition is prolonged and not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it: or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members or ligaments; then treat it by the treatment for fistulas, as previously described.

Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or of the foot; and perhaps it arises on the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore its condition is prolonged, and its treatment is neglected, and it becomes an abscess with a hot abscess: or it becomes corrupted and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor; and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary that you cut with iron the entire excess that remains of the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For cautery is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If however the bone is healthy, and the nail also is healthy, and the superfluous parts of the nail are now pressing the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it and injure it, then it is necessary that you place a thin reed under the angle of the nail which pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards; and cut the flesh with ease, and place on that which remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until the whole of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If however the corruption has already penetrated the bone, then it is necessary to cut the bone and extract it; for it will never be healed while the corrupt bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption proceeding into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to its previous description.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, there is a rubbing or striking of the nail, and a severe pain occurs in it, then it is necessary to first bleed the sick person.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp spatulum in a transverse section from above.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And beware that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the sick person by that, and it will be a cause for the birth of additional flesh in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with what soothes the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	However, the extra finger that arises in some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps some have bone in them, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some arise at the root of the joint, or its origin is in some nodes of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, the one that arises in some nodes of the finger does not move; and the one that arises near the joint of the finger perhaps does move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the one that is fleshy among them, its incision is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	However, the treatment of the one whose origin is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from its incision.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	However, in that which arises in the finger at the last knot, then you must first cut its flesh in a round incision, all the way to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	And the consolidation that occurs between fingers often happens either from the man's birth, that is, it is born with him, or from a wound's consolidation, or from burning by fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, you must separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them strips, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not become quickly consolidated, and separate them; or place a thin sheet of lead between them, until the place has been consolidated as it ought to be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the member's shape.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	About the incision of a defect.
Caput XCII.	Chapter Ninety-two.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Ulcers are veins wrapped, thick, full of melancholic superfluities that occur in many body members; and their effects are most frequent in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel, work, and carry burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to administer a shaking of the body from black cholera sometimes with strong shaking.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then phlebotomize the patient's basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	However, their treatment with iron, is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they be cut, and the black blood be drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein be lifted, and the whole thing be drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	However, the incision of it is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, soak the leg in a great deal of hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then, bind the sick person's leg from the upper part of their thigh down to the lower part of their knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise, that is, draw the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and the physician must first do this on the sick person.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail down to the bottom, until an amount of blood sufficient and which the sick person's strength can tolerate is released.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards, tie it [the wound]; and order him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting, when the veins are full and it harms the sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	Its raising, however, is in this way.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the sick person if it has many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then immerse him in a bath; or apply a warm water embrocation to his leg, until it reddens and the veins swell; or, if a bath is not available, have him exercise vigorously, until the limb is heated.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin in a straight line along the vein: either at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from all sides until it is apparent to the senses: and its appearance is that you see it, inclining from red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it therefore emerges from the skin, you see it white, as if it were a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce a probe beneath it, until, when it is lifted and emerges from the skin, suspend it with a gentle, blunt hook.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then cut another section near that section by three fingers' breadth.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it with the probes, as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut another section, or several sections, if you need them.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift, and cut it at the very last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that until you pull it out from the section that is above, or higher than all the sections, until when it emerges whole: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	If however it does not obey you in pulling and lifting it: then insert an awl with strong thread doubled, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod beneath it; and revolve your hand in every direction until it emerges.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful not to cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes difficult for you to lift it greatly, and harm enters upon the weak from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have pulled it out whole: then place upon the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil; and care for it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vine is contracted, having a twisting to which there is wrapping to the sides, and it is not as we have said in terms of straightness, then it is necessary to cut along it in every direction of its twist and its points of wrapping.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks, until you have lifted it all: and be careful at your incision upon it not to cut a vein, or wound it: for it will become difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	Shape of the incident by which the vine is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Shape of the blind hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have a curvature like the other hooks, nor is it sharp at the end so as not to injure a vein: and it is of a thick, gentle flexure, because if it were thin, it would cut a vein with its thinness: indeed, let its thickness be superfluous, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Al-Jazirah and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, few in tenderness, that is, in which neither grass nor tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction which occurs beneath the skin, just as serpents and ascarid worms and worms generated between the skin and flesh occur.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And a sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place becomes blistered.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary to wrap a piece of lead, weighing from one drachma keil to two drachmae, around it and tie it, and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever anything emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in lead and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it extends a long way, then cut part of it and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it at the root before the whole of it emerges.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it retracts and enters the flesh, and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore, it must be gently handled and pulled out gradually until it emerges from its outermost part and nothing remains of it in the body; and from this vein indeed, in some men, there emerges what is five palms and ten in its length.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has now come to my attention that it emerged from a man at twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	However, if it is incised in the time of your medication, then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long probe, along with the body, until all that is in it of matter is evacuated; and treat the putrefaction of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and a branch emerges from each opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore treat it, as we said in the division, and with what has been stated before.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Concerning the incision on worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Cattle Disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This ailment is called in a certain land among us the Cattle Disease; because it often happens to oxen, and is a small single worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending; and it is shown to the senses by its movement from limb to limb, until it breaks wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humours.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As happen worms and snakes, that is, roundworms, and threadworms in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it moves within the body, and rises to the head, and reaches a place, then perhaps it bursts there, and emerges, and destroys the eye; and that happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Therefore, when you wish to cure it, and extract it, then it is not done except at its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong binding ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it has sunk into the flesh, and you do not find it, then place a cautery with fire over the place, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then bind beneath it the eyebrow with a good ligature.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary for the sick person to use cleansing of their body, with medicines that dissolve the bad putrid humours.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Concerning the incision above the illness of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This illness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then changes from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have indeed seen it, as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was summoned to a woman ill in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she exposed her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained an hour, I saw one swelling move with the pulse, like a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than it can be: so that it is like quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore, the pain receded from that place, and it settled in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it circulated throughout her whole body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	Therefore, I marvelled at the speed of its change from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed, I had not previously seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb; and I have not seen it in this way with my own eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it is anything but because the woman was one of those whose dry bodies have detected veins; hence, that windy movement appears to the senses.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, and hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you wish to treat it, and the patient feels the pain there: then if it is apparent to your eye, as we said, then tighten above it, and below it quickly; and cut above it, until that constricted windiness emerges; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If, however, you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels winds, and calms them with foul pills, and pills of serpent, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On the extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are diversified according to their kinds, and according to the places in which they strike the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is indeed, because among them are those which have large points, and small: and concave, and blunt.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are those with tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are those with stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those, however, which are according to the members on which they fall, are according to two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For either the members are from the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lungs, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and things like them.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and signs of death appear to you, which I tell you later, then you must avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows it in whomever it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and emerges through the covering above the brain, are: because there happen from it violent headache, and scotoma, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood emerges from the nostrils, or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And white moisture like gruel emerges from the place of the wound.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And from it emerges something like the watery part of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not emerge.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow striking the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and that one feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the pulse's movement: and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore, that death descends undoubtedly.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And a sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound: and the vessels which follow the neck fester, and the sick person's color changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he breathes out a large, deep breath: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If an arrow strikes the membrane, which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and there is a large gasping with intense pain, with a sigh: and all the arm members move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if an arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps something undigested food exits from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if an arrow strikes the belly, and is fixed in it: something of excrement, or zirb, or intestine that is already ruptured, exits from the wound.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope in its treatment, nor in extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If an arrow strikes the bladder, and urine exits: and something proceeds from it to the exterior, and the pain is stronger than the weakness: then know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	However, the remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and the arm, and the vertebrae of the back, and the collarbone, and the hip, and the leg, and similar members are saved according to various conditions, when the arrow does not strike an artery, or a nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen of the nature of these arrows, so that you may signify through it upon your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear; and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained from it only a small tip, with which it adheres to its shaft; and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no bad accident happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is the one which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore, I cut above it between the two guides: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	Therefore, I worked with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	Therefore, after thirty days had passed, and nothing of his conditions had changed upon him, I cut above the arrow: and I worked upon it, and I extracted it: and he was healed, and no bad accident happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man on whom an arrow fell on his back, and the wound on it was healed.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	Therefore, after seven years, an arrow exited at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman on whom an arrow fell into her belly, and the wound on it was healed, and the arrow remained inside her: and no change was made in any of her conditions, and the woman did not find any harm to her in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, on whose face an arrow fell: and the wound was healed, and it remained, causing him not much pain: and many similar to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from the king's chief men, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already deviated slightly to the right side: and the entire arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	Therefore, I was summoned for his treatment after the arrow's fall up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Therefore, I found the arrow wound to be very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	Therefore, I searched for it with a fine probe, and did not feel it: and indeed he found a prick and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	Therefore, I hoped that that prick was from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	Therefore, I plastered the area with a plaster in which there was attracting and digestive virtue, trusting in myself that the area would become an abscess, and that I would see a sign of the arrow, so that I could cut over it: and there was no sign in the place indicating that the arrow had reached the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	Therefore, I applied the plaster to him for many days: and no sign appeared, and the wound healed meanwhile: and he remained weak from the extraction of it for many days, until he felt the arrow one day inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	Therefore, I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened: and when I probed it, I felt a thin arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I continued to apply the sharp medicine to the wound opening, until the arrowhead became visibly apparent: and approximately four months passed with him during this time.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had enlarged, and I was able to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to extraction, I did not cease to refine and devise methods concerning it, until one day I used forceps properly made, as will be shown in the form of them at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the infirm was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I narrate to you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows, so that you may posit it as a rule and significance over that which I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with the narration; nor does the book comprehend it, and a skillful craftsman compares little things to great things; and with that which is present, to that which is absent; and finds a new operation and a new instrument in the descent of foreign things of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say, therefore, that arrows do not emerge from the members on which they are fixed, except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by traction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the contrary of another part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which emerges from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place, and is drawn out, and emerges.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not yield to exit at the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary to leave it for some days, until the flesh that is around it rots, and its traction is eased, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly if it is fixed in the bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for some days, and repeatedly apply traction and motion every day, until it emerges.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow's surrounding material is enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then pull it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If, however, the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already progressed into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of the aforementioned accidents appear from the weakened one, then abstain from pulling the arrow and leave it, until its condition is equalized after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate as far as the sifach, and the weak one remains unwell for some days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him, then proceed with the removal of the arrow and its extraction.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If, however, it is very firmly fixed and does not yield to pulling, then apply a drill around the arrow, as I have described to you; then treat the site until it is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sight, then search for it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then pull it out with certain instruments that are suitable for its removal.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If, however, you cannot remove it because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the arrow's length deep inside, and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there, then cut around it until the wound is widened, and it is possible to remove the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If it has ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed to them from every side, by every method you can; and if that method is not sufficient to free the flesh from the breaking or twisting of the ears, continue until it escapes.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the removal of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you make it escape; and with the utmost delicacy, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot remove it within one hour, then leave it for several days until those surrounding it rot.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try again: for it will then be easier.  But if a flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we have said about its treatment in its chapter; and guard your skill from incision of a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And employ every method possible for the arrow's escape; and let it be with ease and tranquility, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary, when you pull out the arrow, that it be weak in accordance with the shape in which the arrow was lodged.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because it is more helpful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If however it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible to you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	However, if an arrow exits from the opposite side, either something is already protruding from it outwards, or the arrowhead causes a swelling on the skin near the upper part, and you see it protruding; therefore cut over it, and let the incision be according to the amount that the forceps can grasp.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it out; for it becomes easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If however it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the arrow strikes the bone, and enlarges itself; then pull it.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not, leave it for a few days; then try it again, until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow's shaft is in it, then push it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however the shaft has fallen away, and you wish to administer a push, then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then push it out with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If however the arrow is concave, then push it out with an instrument entering it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is relieved by it.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cauterize all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with whatever is appropriate for it.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side; and it is close enough to what you touch with probes, and it is possible for you to cut above it, then cut, and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve, and pull it out.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then stitch the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the extremities be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many forms of them are made, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity of the arrow's size, and its smallness, and the width of the wound, and its constriction.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the pushing concave one.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of the pushing deaf one.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the deaf extremity, like a ray, so that its entrance into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be propelled with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The extremity of this pushing concave one is concave like a bird's feather: so that the arrow's entrance into it and its propulsion may be eased.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter XCVII.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins to be bled, whose use runs through the body, are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which are visible on the two temples; and two veins that are at the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Looking ones; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein that is at the end of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.

Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	And these are the veins called Algecherich.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins which are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	The veins, however, which are opened in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the Cephalica, and it is from the wild side: and the common people call it the vein of the head.
Et Fusca.	And the Fusca.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And it is the Middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilica, and a branch of the Cephalica: and the common people call it the vein of the body.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And the Basilica, and it is situated on the domestic side: and it is also called the Titillicaris.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	And the common people call it the vein of the belly.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And the Cord of the arm, and it is situated above the fossa: and it is that in which bloodletting is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb by clear appearance.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And the Saluatella: and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is that which is under the curve of the big toe on the wild side.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second is the Saphena: and its place is at the heel on the domestic side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	And the vein Nesse: and its place is at the heel on the wild side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	Phlebotomies of the two veins behind the ears are beneficial for old colds, and hemiplegia, and headaches, and old, bad head ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is as I describe.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is done by shaving the patient's head, and rubbing the back of his head in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, with a good friction.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then let the patient tighten his neck with a bandage until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark those places with ink.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take a phlebotomous knife, and that is called the Incidens.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then insert it beneath the vein in the skin, until the phlebotomous reaches the opening.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin with a sloping incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or about that: and cause as much blood to issue as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then bind it with bandages, and leave it until it heals.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And already previously in the beginning of the book was the incision of them, and the cauterization of them.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	Concerning the phlebotomy of two arteries in the temples.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	Phlebotomy of the two arteries located in the two temples is helpful in mitigating old hemiplegia, and in addressing crookedness, and persistent ophthalmia, and the excessive flow of acute, shed tears to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	Let the infirm person strain their neck much, until two veins become clearly visible to the senses, and their pulse is demonstrably felt under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then, mark the locations with ink.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then, lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the incision-making phlebotom, and lift the vein upwards.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it, as you did in the other two veins: and make blood flow according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then loosen the infirm person's constriction, and place your finger upon the vein for one hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Afterwards, place a bandage and pads upon it, and bind it tightly above the constriction: and release it, until it is healed.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	And already the remembrance of them, and their incision, and their extraction have preceded at the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the frontal vein after the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.

Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotome.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it should not be a phlebotome with a sharp end, like the other phlebotomes, rather it should have a broad end.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And phlebotomize it along the transverse direction, because the bone is close by: and perhaps the phlebotome will break in it when it is slender.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins in the two tear ducts.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the Nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	Phlebotomy of the veins of the Nose is useful for acute fevers, and violent headaches, and diseases of the face, such as hemicrania, and redness that occurs in the face, especially when it is of long standing.

Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long lancet, and place it in the middle of his nostril, between that which divides the nose according to its straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Since the vein is not apparent to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the lancet for a little while, and cause blood to flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	Then tie it with a single bandage.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	For it is quickly restored.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of Guidegi.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	The benefit of the two phlebotomies of Guidegi is for constriction of breathing, and the onset of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that corrode, that is, shingles.

Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and tie the two veins with a middle constriction, so that the weak person is not overly choked.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	And leave it until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	For the wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	On the phlebotomy of veins, Algeberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	The veins, according to Algeberich, are a help in phlebotomy: because they contribute to sores in the mouth, and gum corruption; and bad ulcers; and lip fissures, and bad ulcers, even those that are on the nose and its surroundings.

Then roll back his lip and look at the two veins: one of which is on the right of the lip and the second on its left; and the demonstration of both is by the blackness of both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	And that is true, because around them are small, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore, cut each with a single incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	If, however, there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then direct yourself to the incision of the larger of them, and the more evident of them.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do with the two veins that are on the upper lip; and indeed, most custom runs with it; and cut the two veins which are on the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Concerning phlebotomy of the veins under the tongue after phlebotomy of the cephalic veins.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the suffocation which is in the throat, and the illness of the uvula, and the illnesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person should sit between your hands in the presence of the sun; and lift his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein; and the color of each is sloping towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore, phlebotomize each one; and guard that you do not put your hand to the utmost in phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under it are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	However, the three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those whose phlebotomy has run in custom among all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a broad myrtle phlebotome, or an olive-shaped one, to a degree of steepness, or by cutting with a knife phlebotome, and it is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	Thus Alnesil is, what is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And of them are broad and narrow types, according to the width and constriction of the veins.  The shape of the myrtle phlebotome should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, large veins, and those containing thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotome is of lesser width, and of a finer extremity.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of slender veins, which contain subtle, yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the Basilica vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilica vein, which is one of these three veins, is a help in phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from ailments of the throat and neck, from thence following the chest and belly; and it befits the phlebotomist, when phlebotomizing it, to be cautious and to be wary of it, for there is an artery beneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will strike that artery, and there will be an occurrence of blood flow.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a phlebotomizing instrument; rather, he should cut with an Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If, however, the Basilica vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to abandon it and to switch to another, or to seek a branch of it; or to phlebotomize the Brachial vein instead.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is indeed manifest, and cut it with a phlebotomizing Anesil instrument, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If however you wish to phlebotomize the same vein, then it is necessary, before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the place, until you recognize the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with ink, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the Alnesil instrument, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware that the blow does not fall in the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you constrict the ligament, an inflation in the place which you marked with ink, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood at the phlebotomy leap, like the urine of a child, and it is thin blood, red: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then quickly, place your finger over it for a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then constrict the arm, and release it; and let the patient beware of its movement; and let it be upon his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not move it for several days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If however the blood is not cut off, and overcomes you; and there is no medicine present for you in your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities contract, and blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take the bark of the fig tree, and split it; take one half, and tie it over the place of the vein with a proper constriction, with a bandage and lint until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not, then treat it with that whose recollection preceded from the place of powders cutting off the flow of blood; and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Concerning phlebotomy of the Fusca vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	Phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is beneficial, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica vein and a branch of the Cephalica vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it befits the phlebotomist that it be above fear from its phlebotomy, for a nerve is beneath it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	Therefore, if the phlebotomist adds in the puncture, and finds a nerve, numbness occurs in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle and not shown, then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy, so that you phlebotomize it, incision with a lancet, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Concerning the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is beneficial, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish, to phlebotomize it by pricking with an olive-wood lancet, or with a myrtle-wood lancet: because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery nor nerve beneath it.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is fitting for you in phlebotomy to avoid with the lancet only the head of the muscle, and to seek a smoother place: and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first blow, so that it may be repeated over it with phlebotomy several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps it becomes inflamed in some people when it is not phlebotomized on the first strike, but that inflammation does not harm them in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Concerning the usefulness of Phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	However, the quality of Phlebotomy, and its consequent accidents, which you must consider in its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First, you should know that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health, and its endurance, and caution against the onset of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that phlebotomy is performed in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, and the Basilic, and the Median cubital.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that phlebotomy is performed in the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in Spring and Summer; and in Autumn and Winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let phlebotomy be performed on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed of the day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, phlebotomy administered in illnesses does not have a set hour; but when convenience and necessity call for it, at night, or day, and at all hours, and at all times.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should the elderly be bled, who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled for whatever reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels beforehand with a mild clyster, if there is much retained stool in them, so that the veins during the phlebotomy do not draw out putrid, harmful superfluities from the intestines to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient be bled who is suffering from a surfeit, nausea, or drunkenness, until that has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor should a sick person with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And phlebotomy should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that weakens the body's or animal's strength.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods, drinks, and medicines, if it is possible to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then he should enter a bath, if nothing prevents him; or he should exercise with some exercise, so that the blood may be made thinner.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third day, as we said: and strive that his chest be emptied that day of all evil animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excess of intercourse, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him have present in his seat things with whose use custom has run among men from aromatics, and scents, and dancing, and similar things in the greatest possible quantity.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion which is higher than the phlebotomist's cushion; afterwards let him pull his arm out and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then tie the bandage with a strap, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, for when the constriction is unequal, or through excess in the constriction, then it hinders the course of blood; or in relaxation, then it also hinders the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the phlebotomist rub his hands together until the veins swell and are made apparent to the senses.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then let the phlebotomist wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old, proper oil.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then let him place his left index finger slightly over the vein itself, beneath the place where he intends to make the phlebotomy, so that the vein does not move and the blow is not missed.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because there are veins that are like a fleeing string during phlebotomy; and there are those that are full of airiness; and when you place the phlebotom on it, it contracts under the phlebotom, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the phlebotom does not open the vein; and if it does open it, it is constricted.  Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and careful in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should lay down the phlebotom.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein is opened at the first attempt, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it another time under that place slightly, or above it with haste, if the place is not inflamed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If, however, it becomes inflamed, or the patient becomes weak, then leave him for a day or two, and do not tighten the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps it will draw a hot abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor let him enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the bloodletting, if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that not the quantity of blood you desire will exit, then repeat the bloodletting in the same opening according to the straightness, and add a little in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it with haste, before the place is suppurated, for a suppurated place is in many people in a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If therefore you see it already suppurated, then do not repeat on it at all, for it does not excuse anything to you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something of the dregs of oil upon it, because it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than the other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies, where phlebotomies open veins against the prohibition of blood flow: and the Tyriac alfarach, and sagzenea do this, when one of them is placed upon the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is made thinner and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If a large abscess occurs at the phlebotomy site, for it often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist except on that occasion, or if the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed a little, upon the place: and bind it for one hour: for it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has exited the vein itself, when it is full, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If some blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm: and if you wish, put some aloe, or dissolved myrrh, or some of the juice of mint, that is, of balm or similar to it, upon it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And very often indeed abscesses and prominences occur at phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore, place your hand upon it; then if you find softness upon compression with your hand upon it, then that prominence is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, beware that you put something upon it of that which we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster on it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it be allowed to exit until it turns red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then let it be allowed to exit until it becomes thin; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting at once, that the vein's phlebotomy be widened and the phlebotomist be broad; and in the one who is weak, be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he extract it in portions, and that the opening be narrow; and better what is administered in vein-letting is that it be a transverse incision, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is safe from a flow of blood, and from the incision of a nerve; and it is more praiseworthy, and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it is accustomed to come to fainting in bloodletting, it is necessary that he eat before bloodletting a little bread soaked in pomegranate-water; or secaniabin, if it is heated; and extract from his blood in three or four portions.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold temperament, then let him take before bloodletting bread soaked in myrrh syrup, or in syrup of spiced honey, or in fragrant aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If fainting occurs during bloodletting, and its cause is the abundant outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he take in a drink water of flesh, and a subtle fragrant syrup; and let him use aromatics with almug; and let his chest be lined with it; and let him use the rest that we have stated in the division in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to evacuate his arm and release his blood a second time, it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is for a great evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he release blood gradually by the amount of strength over consecutive days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	However, whoever wants to evacuate his arm and release his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary that he be evacuated on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body, however, is much blood already heated, and sharpened, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood depart from it in one instance, and a large quantity be drawn from it; and the opening be enlarged until fainting occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and that you place your hand upon his pulse at the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For often that happens, when the bloodletter does not know, and negligence falls.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary, when you wish to release the arm and release blood a second time, when the opening of the vein is already closed and the exit of blood is difficult, that you press upon it with violence, and rapidly bend or extend it.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is very harmful; indeed, leave it, until it is bled again.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of the bloodletter that which has clotted from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place upon it something of dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place upon it something of al-thiryac al-faruq or sagzenea, and place it with gentle compression, until the blood issues forth.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If however the vein is already ulcerated, then leave it, and do not touch it, until the ulcer subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If, however, necessity provokes you to draw blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either bleed him above that place or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	However, the arm's vein should be lanced at the place of the Cephalic and Basilic veins, when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the bloodletting is such that the infirm person should immerse his hand in warm water until the skin reddens, and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then tie it above it with a ligature with a moderate constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then lance it transversely, gradually, not laterally, nor longitudinally; and let the opening be wide, and your incision be over the joint of the hand for a short time.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the flow of blood is impeded, then immerse the hand again in warm water and allow the blood to flow into the water until you achieve your desired result.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If, however, you are in the days of summer, then you are excused from the repetition of immersing the hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed, the flow of blood is placed most frequently in warm water in wintertime.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And the incision of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy of the right hand's Saluatella vein is beneficial for liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you should constrict the mahason of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein swells and becomes very apparent to the senses.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then, incise it transversely.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful not to finish your hand with the lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then, return the hand to warm water, and let the blood run in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein, and is prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When therefore you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt upon the vein: so that it does not quickly consolidate.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly it is necessary that you do so with every tight branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand, however, is: because it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen: and similarly do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of saphenous phlebotomy is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as ailments of the womb, and the retention of menses, and illnesses of the kidneys, and old sores of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should immerse their foot in warm water: and do friction upon it until the veins swell: and bind above the joint of the foot with a strap.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the vein's location is at the heel, appearing toward the big toe: and from it branches out many branches on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or at the heel in its aggregation, because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you phlebotomize it on the foot's surface, then beware of the nerves that are under it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy instrument so that you phlebotomize it across, as if you wish to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If however the outflow of blood is prevented, then repeatedly place his foot in warm water, and allow the blood to flow into it, until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the phlebotomist errs in the first instance, then he should repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the saphena of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The Sciatica vein's location, as we said, is near the heel on the wild side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the relief of phlebotomy is for it, for the pain of the knee, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the patient should enter a warm bath, and hasten: and he should bind his leg from the side of the knee up to the heel by four fingers, with a long, thin bandage: for it does not appear except on account of that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it therefore appears, then the phlebotomist should cut it according to whatever skill is possible to you, or according to a transverse method; and it is better either to cut it with an incision, or to sever it by a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If, however, you do not find it, and it is not at all apparent to the senses, then the phlebotomist should cut some branch of it, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and cause as much blood to flow as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the bandage, and place leather over the phlebotomy site, and bind the area.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it quickly heals.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Concerning Cupping, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cupping instruments are made from horns, and from brass, and from glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And cupping indeed is done according to two methods.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification, and the extraction of blood; and the other is cupping without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or indeed it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And cuppings that are administered with scarification and the extraction of blood are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is the cupping Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and the cuppings Alhagdahim, and they are two flaps of the neck at both sides together; and the cuppings of the chin, and it is below the jaw in the lower part of the mouth; and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and the cuppings Alachosos above the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two armpits, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two calves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And cupping indeed does not extract blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that, virtue does not fall from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should cupping, whether with or without fire, be administered in any illness arising from fullness until the whole body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity prompts cupping for illness or because of custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle of it, and whenever it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because there are people in whom when blood multiplies within, until it needs extraction by cupping, they find heaviness and soreness in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And some of them find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And some of them find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And some of them scratch the site of their cupping.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And some of them have increased laughter.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And some of them find the taste of blood in their mouth; or the tongue becomes suppurated, and they spit blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And some of them have increased sleep.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And some of them see in their sleep blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	Therefore, when we see any of these things, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order a letting of wind, after two or three hours have passed of the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The benefit of letting wind from the nape of the neck is: because it contributes to the heaviness in the head, and what is poured out to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	However, it is necessary that it be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this cupping is in place of a head-vein incision.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permitted to use it on one of cold temperament, or in whom there is a cold.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And therefore it is not appropriate that the aged, and those with cold ailments on their heads, use it.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But if one is continuously on top of it, forgetfulness is generated in him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And therefore it is necessary to order the wind-dresser to lay his hand for a little while lower with the wind, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Wind-dressing, or Alkehel, is in place of the phlebotomy of the Fusca and the Basilica phlebotomy, and therefore it is beneficial for asthma, and constriction of breathing, and fissure of the breathing instrument, and coughing, and fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the Alkehel cupping glass be impelled for a little while, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Wind-dressing, however, of the alhagdahim, is beneficial for accidental pains in the head, and ophthalmia, and hemicrania, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in place of the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary to instruct the wind-dresser not to press his hand with the scarification, so that he does not strike an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Wind-dressing, however, under the chin, is beneficial for ulcers in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar to them of diseases which are in the mouth: and it stands in the place of the phlebotomy of alieherich, which are on the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Wind-dressing of the spatulas, however, is beneficial for alchafacham, which is produced by repletion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Wind-dressing, however, of the inner parts of the two foci, is beneficial as a substitute for the phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilica, and Fusca, and Cephalica: because it draws blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh; and those small veins draw from other larger veins than themselves, until the drawing reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary to instruct the wind-dresser not to proceed too far in the scarification, because the place is denuded of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	A cupping vessel, however, that is cupped above the alchausos, is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary to instruct the wind-dresser that the cupping vessel be large and made of air, because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps the thin cupping vessels will break; and it should be scarified with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Cupping of the legs diminishes noticeably: because they draw blood from the whole body, and they relieve old pains in the kidneys, and the womb, and the bladder; they provoke menstruation, and are beneficial for botor and ademenul; and they stand in the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of alhorcobeni cupping is close to the benefit of cupping the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of placing the cupping vessels is that you should first place an empty cupping vessel and apply moderate suction. And do not prolong the placement of the cupping vessels, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with equal arrival. And do not cease repeating this and continuing it, until you see the place already reddened and inflamed, and the redness of blood appears: then, therefore, scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those who are of delicate flesh, with rare pores, it is necessary to scarify them once, no more, so that the place is not ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the cupper to enlarge the scarification and deepen it slightly, and to moderate the suction with ease, speed, and smooth movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to scarify it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first instance, a path is opened for the thinning of the blood and its becoming watery; and in the second, for a careful examination of the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If, however, the blood is very foul, then let the scarification be performed a third time, so that it may achieve its final result.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or for a short time, a single scarification suffices for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish for a large extraction of blood, we scarify many times.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification; and the equal limit in the scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which ought to be administered from oils at the placement of Cupping, and what should the cupper beware of?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places of cupping be anointed with oils that are opening, soothing, and resolving: if it is in summer time, such as the oil of alkeiri, or the oil of violet, or the oil of sweet almonds, or the oil of pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in winter time, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or sarbantine oil: and similar to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If however the superfluity is thick, cold: then the oil should be amaracin oil, or balsam oil, or alben oil, or anise oil: and similar to these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If however the cupper is of large pores, tender flesh: then it is necessary that he abstain from oil, and it is necessary that those ones wash the places of cupping after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with soothing water, or with pumpkin water, or with purslane water: and similar to them.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	However, he whose blood is of much moisture, should wash the cuppings with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac: and similar to them.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	However, whose superfluities are thick, should wash their cuppings with old wine, or with sorrel water, or with anise decoction, or camomile: and similar to them.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that cupping be avoided in a bath, or in the vicinity of a bath, indeed it is necessary that it be administered after exiting from the bath by an hour, or by two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that anyone sleep after cupping.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it by which it is necessary that the Ventosandus, or Phlebotomist, be governed before cupping?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after it, it is necessary to consider first: if the Ventosus or Phlebotomist is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation overcome his blood, then it is necessary that he take refrigerants, such as pomegranate juice, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and iuleb, and similar to them.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And place his food chickens, and mutton sekebiget, and foods seasoned with gooseberries, and similar to them.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in his drink syrup from honey, or from almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and let him take medium scented wine, which is between old and new: and let him be instructed to use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And place his food chickens, and canebir, and sparrows, that is, small birds, and young doves issiadebet.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of the ventosation and phlebotomy be more than the food; and it is necessary that, in some men, in the hours of tyriaca alfaroch, or a medicine of moss, that is, musk, or alesselithe be given in the drink before the ventosation, and before the phlebotomy, or after, so that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood may be refined.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary that they take it in heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Concerning ventosations without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	However, ventosations that are without scarification are ventosations that are placed upon the liver, and the spleen, and the gout, and upon the belly, the navel, and the places of the kidneys, and the chest of the loins, because these members do not tolerate scarification upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And they are not sought out by them, unless either a connection of blood from a member to a member; just as we place a ventosa upon the nipples in an illness of nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to free a member from a cold, viscous windiness in the member; just as we place a ventosa upon the belly and the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it indeed rarefies the member, and warms it, and removes the pain because it dissolved that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed upon the kidneys when obstruction or a stone occurs in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by its power of attraction, perhaps it opens the obstruction or uproots the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it does when placed upon the liver and spleen for a troublesome windiness in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these cupping glasses are administered empty with only a cut.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in cases of pleurisy; and that is so that the cupping glass be filled and be large, with only warm water, or water in which herbs suitable for it have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Form of cupping glass administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two open fingers, according to what we have formed: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be a small hole on its side, in a place approximately in the middle of it, according to the size for a needle to enter it: let it be made of bronze, or brass, with thick, smooth, even, polished edges, so that it does not injure the limb in its placement upon it: and let a transverse rod of bronze or iron be in its center, where the candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this cupping glass is made large, larger than the one we described, and a little smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the cupping glasses of children and the thin are different from the cupping glasses of men and those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The method of placing this cupping glass with fire upon the limb is to light a wick with fire from flax properly, or a small candle of wax, and place it over the middle of the transverse rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass: so that the fire is kindled approximately at the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the body of the sick person is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed upon the limb, and a finger is placed over the hole that I mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glass, as long as we need it, we remove the finger, and vapor will exit through that hole, and the cupping glass will be released immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the wick according to its way, and repeat it, if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in a cupping glass applied in the illness of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod, nor hole: and it is not applied except because it is filled with water, and placed upon the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And the larger this cupping glass is, so that it can hold much water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Concerning the suspension of bloodsuckers.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Bloodsuckers are not applied in multiple places, unless in those limbs where the application of cupping is impossible, due to their small size, such as the lip, and the gums, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a limb denuded of flesh, such as a finger, and the nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that you should take bloodsuckers which are in fresh, clean waters, free from putrid matter.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be left in fresh water by day and night, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be evacuated first with bloodletting and with cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then cleanse the limb of the sick person until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place them upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When, therefore, they are filled, and fall, and suction of the place is possible with cupping, then it is most helpful; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and it is rubbed, and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the flow of blood after the fall of the Sanguisugarum is prolonged, and it is oozing, then pour a linen cloth into cold water, and place it over it, until the oozing is cut off.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then pulverize ground zegi, or gallnuts, or similar astringents upon it, until the blood is cut off.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place halves of shelled beans on the area, and let them remain until the beans adhere to the area, for the blood is cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And if a repetition of the Sanguisugarum is necessary, when possible, change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If, however, the leeches are prevented from being suspended, then the area is wiped with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or fix a needle in the areas until some blood emerges.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them, for when they sense anything of the blood, they immediately adhere.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish them to fall off, pulverize some crushed aloe, or salt, or ashes on them: and they will fall off immediately.

¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	Book of the Surgery of Albucasis, Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A universal discourse on restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar things.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O children, that the foolish physicians and the common people boast about this chapter, and those who have never examined an ancient book, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason, this method is private among the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never encountered any good in it at all, and I have not attained that which I have attained from it except because of the length of reading ancient books, and study concerning their understanding, until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experiment and study for the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from it in this chapter everything that contains my knowledge: and upon which my experiment has passed, after I have abbreviated it for you, and freed it from the occupation of elongation, and abbreviated it at the end of the abbreviation, and shown it at the end of the declination; and I have formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, since it is from the addition of declination, just as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries, and collections of the nature of bone fractures, from those things whose premise is necessary, before we begin the remembrance of broken limbs, and various ones, if of each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we say in the prologue of this chapter, to summarise the discourse and chapters, the understanding of which the craftsman is first required to attain to stand upon their truth: so that you, and those who are ready, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or fall happens to someone, then it is necessary, first of all, to hasten to bleed him, and to loosen him, or both simultaneously: if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of strength; or if the one to whom anything of these has happened is a child, or a decrepit old man; or if it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold greatly.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content in his food, with cold vegetables, and the flesh of birds, and kids: and forbid wine, and coarse meats, and filling oneself with foods and every food which fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are secure from a hot abscess, and do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb: then let the sick man return to his first regimen with which his custom runs.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When therefore the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing foods, with much, coarse, heavy nourishment, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish: and coarse wine, and things similar to them.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen the coagulation of the fracture happens more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in the first age of old age, and decrepit, cannot be joined and consolidated according to their own nature always, because of the drying out of their limbs: and those that are in them at the end of their lightness are consolidated and joined, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature attaches something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, to the broken bone from every side, by which it adheres to and binds it, until they are glued together and bound together, until it comes to the end of its strength and firmness, as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you put the sick person's nourishment in foods in which there is weight, and viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs: for the fracture of the leg is different from the fracture of the skull: and the fracture of the breastbone is different from the fracture of the spine: and similarly all the other limbs are different from each other: and I have come with a recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its chapter, distinct from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the types of bone fracture are diversified even within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because its fracture is arched, besides which splinters occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes its fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and its fractures are splintery, that is, splinters, and proceeding additions, as are in a reed when a knife is fitted to it for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head: and there is a fracture with a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And each type has its own nature, or instrument, in its restoration, according to which its remembrance will come, distinct in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from what the fracture of the bone is known, there is its twisting and its prominence: and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the place, nor a sound upon touching it with your hand when you touch the bone with movement, nor does the sick person experience great pain; then there is no fracture there, but rather, it is possible that there is a twisting or a small fissure.  Therefore, you should not move it with your hand and pressure at all, but rather place upon it the medicines, the remembrance of which comes, after the time that is appropriate to the location; then a bandage is tied tightly.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when a place is bent and split in two, besides the efforts that happen in it, nevertheless each part is moved away from its counterpart; then it is necessary for you to begin your hour for its straightening, making it even before a hot abscess occurs on it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If however a hot abscess occurs on it, then leave it for several days, until the abscess subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then make it even according to any method possible by gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and its making even is easier than a bone, in which efforts occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it according to how its memory comes to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If however there are efforts in the bone, then extension of this broken limb, if it is a hand or foot, is necessary from two parts; or with your hand, if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb over a level spot, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended: then try to restore those additions to their places with all your skill, and in any way you can; and be careful according to your strength, that no pain or injury be brought upon the weak by your operation; and try to the best of your ability to fit one of the two bones with its partner according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that time that you try and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see there anything different, rectify it and make it equal according to the extent of your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of excessive extension and strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For often they cause a hot abscess or contraction in the limb by their operation; as we have already seen this from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then, after the equalization and proper operation, and constriction of that limb, and rest and tranquility, and admonish the sick person about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him beware that he does not move it during the hours of his waking and his sleep, at its turning, and its agitation, and at its excretion, and all its movements with all his strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he beware lest the position of the limb be one that will follow with pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Because when he feels pain or injury in the disposition of the position of the limb, then it is necessary that he change it to another disposition from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And take care with him that his position be even, straight, so that twisting does not occur in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the constriction of the fractured limb is, according to what I relate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured limbs are diversified in their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, those of them that are small, such as an arm, and a finger, and a foot, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, thin cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	However, those of them that are large, such as the thigh and the leg, it is necessary that there be a wrapping of wide, hard material in them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because a broad ligament connects a large limb and binds it from every side with equal constriction, so that a blemish does not enter it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after your evacuation, begin to apply a suitable liniment to it, on soft lint over the site of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin wrapping the ligament over the fracture site itself with three or four wraps, according to the limb's needs; and tighten your hand slightly on the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then proceed with it towards the upper part from the fracture site, and tighten less than was your previous tightening, with which you tightened the fractured site.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then move away from the fracture site with the wrap slightly, and gradually loosen the constriction, until you obtain a large portion from the healthy part.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another bandage, and wrap it again over the fractured site in wraps.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards, move the bandage to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightening of the bandage, and the loosening of it, according to what we said in the first upper bandage.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the bandages soft wool, or cloth, so that the twisting of the fracture is equalized if there is twisting in it; and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another bandage over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards, place over these bandages evenly-made stars immediately, if there is no swelling in the place, nor a hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If however there is swelling or an abscess in it, then place upon it that which will settle that abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind over it the stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars be made from the halves of broad canes, shaved, skilfully shaped; or let them be made of the wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine, or gerard, that is, palm branches, or calingi; and let the width of every star, according to this form, and this same figure, be [specified].
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the star placed over the wound itself be somewhat thicker and wider than the other stars; and the length of the star should be according to the size and smallness of the member.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind over the stars with another bandage, according to the first binding, the same.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie over it with threads properly, according to what we said about the binding; and it should be that your binding is tighter over the break itself, and the further away from the break it is, the looser the binding.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads be medium in thickness and thinness, and be of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the operation of foolish ones who place their threads from twisted linen cords, it is a great error; because the binding falls out of quality with them.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And again, thin threads do not suit: because you will not achieve through the binding with them that which you desire.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger between splint and splint.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after the binding in healthy places, then place under them soft tow or dyed wool until nothing is injured from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	However, when there is a fracture with a wound, and a rupture occurs in the skin, I will come with a reminder of it in the second chapter according to its singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured limb needs to be bound with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	Because when a limb is large, you should not put splints on it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your judgment of the safety of preventing a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters, by which the ancients restored those applied to fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	A method of a brief common plaster, restoring fractures, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children, because it is from it that neither heat nor cold prevails.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is as follows: take flour dust, which is the flour meal that hangs on the walls of the mill during the movement of the millstone; and make it as it is, except that you sift it with egg white; and make the concoction neither thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of plaster, restoring fracture, dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take of almess, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath, and juice of all, each 10 drachms; of myrrh and aloes, each 5 drachms; and of alethil 20 drachms.  Grind all these together, and sift them; and mix them with alethil water, or with egg white if the patient's complexion is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is a good compound, restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plaster, which also benefits fracture and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take of mugath, mess, and white marshmallow, of all 10 drachms; of myrrh and aloes, each 5 drachms; of acacia 6 drachms; of Armenian bole 20 drachms. Grind all thoroughly, sift them, and make a paste with water, or egg white; and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places; and it relieves the pain occurring to them, and the splitting of bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take fresh wool and soak it in vinegar and boiled oil; and place it on the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good for calming a hot abscess; and it drives out pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	A method of plaster that restores a fractured bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of the fig tree and the leaves of the wild poppy; and grind them all and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	A method of a shortened plaster, administered in the restoration of a broken bone; and when you desire the resolution of the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of marshmallow, and chamomile, and violet flowers, and herb flour, of each one part: let all be ground, and mixed with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If however it is inflamed, then prepare it with the water of moist coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	A method of another stronger plaster in resolution, than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of the limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take the root of marshmallow, and flaxseed, and pomegranate seeds, and melilot, and plantain, and violet flowers, and chamomile, of each one part: let all be ground, and mixed with willow water, or with fresh water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All that according to the warmth of the limb and the quiet of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration except a plaster made from wax and oil; nothing else; and he recounted that it should be of a consistency between thick and thin.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, thought that things that dry out heat should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration, such as myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense, and similar ones to those that we have recounted.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of the plaster which is beneficial for injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugwort, and chickpeas, and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and marshmallow root, and salt in equal parts: grind them, and sift them, and mix them: and make a plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The amount of time the bandage should remain, then be removed, is that you should consider, if no pain or itching occurs in the patient, and if the fractured bone is not moved from its place: then do not remove it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if such itching, or disturbing pain, or swelling occurs in the area, then quickly loosen it, and remove the plaster: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, moistened: and immerse it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it, until the itching subsides, and the pain settles.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then allow the limb to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place upon it cut wool, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it upon it for one night, until you are sure of the absence of a hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then again apply a gentle bandage and a small plaster; and do not tighten it with your first bandaging, and treat it gently until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all the accompanying symptoms have completely disappeared, and you no longer need a plaster and bandage, then treat it again as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing of what we have said happens to the limb, then do not loosen it, except after three, or four, or five, or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is left for twenty days, according to what appears to you from the limb's healing, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and the flesh's coagulation approximates it: then also add more binding than your first complete binding; and also add more strengthening food, according to its previous recollection.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If however you see the fracture site already drying out and thinning more than necessary, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it, and let it remain for three days, and ease the bandage slightly.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, therefore, nourishment reaches the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	However, that which foolish restorers do to a fractured limb a second time, when it is not restored at first as it should be, and is restored according to twisting, is an error of their operation, and a great fear: and if it were correct, the ancients would have said it in their books, and would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have seen no trace of it anywhere in that at all, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Concerning the treatment of an accidental injury to the head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The kinds of fractures are diverse, and its shapes are many: and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture that is caused by a blow with a sword; and the blow removes the bone as far as it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood; and because of that, this type of fracture is called Axialis.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword cuts a part of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the incision does not penetrate to its utmost limit; and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, a lifting absolutely.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture which is a crushing or abrasion; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which now approaches the periosteum, which is under the bone, or is on the surface of the bone; and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone in the subtlety of a hair; and it is a small fissure, and because of that this type of fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And of these is a fracture, which happens from a fall, or a blow from a stone, and similar things, which cause a layer of bone to enter the interior, and a hollow is formed there; just as it happens with bronze cauldrons, when a blow strikes them, and a part of them enters the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this happens most often in the heads of moist bones, such as the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And for all these types of fractures, separate descriptions are made, and I will come with a recollection of it all in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we recognize all these types of fractures through examination upon it, and investigation of them with probes, and the removal of the corrupted flesh that is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	However, the capillary type is recognized by this, that it is uncovered on the bone and cleaned, and smeared upon it with ink: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, first consider the patient's symptoms: then if you see from the symptoms that it signifies manifest danger, such as vomiting, cholera, extension, loss of intellect, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, protrusion of the eyes, redness of them, and similar symptoms in various conditions, without a doubt it will not be healed; and if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for recovery, then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if a wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded, and it is in the days of winter, then it is necessary to strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all the dispositions.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary to hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the membrane becomes corrupted, and those accidents happen which we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and is with fragments and pulling, then it is necessary to cut away the broken and ground portion, as I describe to you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is necessary to shave the head of the wounded person and expose the bone in whatever way possible for you, and according to the shape of the wound and what is gentle upon the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If, during the exposure of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it with what is appropriate.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is necessary to fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and to allow the wound to rest until the abscess subsides and you are certain of the cessation of bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the treatment of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is to cut the bone with a scalpel of narrow blade; and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then apply another scalpel, slightly wider than the first; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then apply yet another scalpel, wider still than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is that you should have a number of different scalpels; some being wider than others, and some shorter than others; and let the edges of their sharpness be the last, and be of iron temper, or steel; and use ease in striking upon the scalpel, so that it does not strike the head and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	However, if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary that you perforate around it, before you apply the scalpels, with drills called drills that do not penetrate deeply; and they are not so called unless because they do not pass the limit of the bony flesh to that which is behind it; because the drill has a round point above that which is under its sharp head, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents it from sinking and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it befits you to take from these drills a great number, each one fitting the quantity of the bone's thickness, until you have a drill present for every skull; whose sharp point's quantity in length and shortness is according to the quantity of that skull's thickness.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of drills, or trepands.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of perforating around a fractured bone is: to place the drill on the bone, and turn it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has already been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another place, and place that which is between every hole the quantity of the thickness of a radius, or approximately that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the knives what is between each hole from the bone: and make it thinner than you can on top of it from the tip of lightness, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand, or with some other of the instruments that you have prepared for it: such as nippers, and fine pincers.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you beware with all caution, lest the drill or the knife touch anything of the marrow.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you have surrounded the bone by piercing, and it has been separated from the marrow, if it has been continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and level the end of it that remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the knife.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be thinner and more delicate than other knives.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If any small pieces of bone remain, and splinters, then take them easily with the instruments you have.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound after that with the bandages and ointments that we have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, entirely free from fear: which Galen said, and praised greatly: and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	First, you must begin to expose the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is more severe and more obvious: until, when you have exposed that part and placed the tip of this lenticular knife there, whose form is this.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part, soft, does not cut anything: and its pointed part running along the two sides of it, as you see: so that the lenticular part rests on the bone, its pointed edge meeting the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike the knife on one side with a small mallet, until you cut the whole bone with ease, as it turns; and be sure, by means of the bandage, that no accident, which you greatly fear, occurs to it.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the surgeon were not more foolish than other men, and more ignorant of it, nor were sleeping, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the bandage in certain places, he would cut it away from it with the tip of his lenticular knife, and free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the bandage, and that which is cut away from the bone is its surface, and there remain on it roughnesses and subtle irregularities: then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness and remove those irregularities with the small razors from which you have prepared a variety of sizes, so that it is possible for you to administer from them the most appropriate and straight ones in every suitable place, according to that to which the operation leads you, and the broken bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer, in your reasoning, by which you first scrape the bone, more widely than those razors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after it one more subtle than that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you arrive at administering the thinnest and most subtle of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining small fissures, and subtle fractures, it is necessary to administer care, according to that which leads to its straightening.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter not hidden from anyone who has any study in this art, and it stands upon that which we have written and shown in great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, the flap is detected when you remove the bone: then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do it as easily as possible over it, so that it is not burdened by this.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer a wide bandage over it; and do not tighten it, unless to the extent that it holds the wound only; and leave it with this treatment for one day, or two days, until you are certain of being free from a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then loosen it, and administer afterward medicines with which superfluous dryness is countered; such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar to them: and it is that you make a powder from these medicines, which is powdered over the wound as it is dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer in it any medicine whose property is to cleanse, and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment be clear; neither be there any dirt of ointment, nor any filth.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor allow the virus to collect in it at all: for when virus collects upon the membrane of the brain, it corrupts it and makes it putrid, and great evil comes upon the sick person afterward; and this occurs in a suppuration of the head, when the bone is cleansed from it, especially when its treatment is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider, if the sick person suffers the accidents that we have mentioned, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine placed upon it, and is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness, then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and linen with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it upon the suppuration; afterward treat it with the kinds of treatment that are suitable until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the Nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that only two parts of the nose's upper portion can break simultaneously, or one of them; for it is composed of two bones. Because its lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break, and it suffers only from abrasion, twisting, and crookedness.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts breaks, then it is necessary to insert the little finger into the nostril, and to align that fracture with your index finger and thumb on the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this skillfully and with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And be careful that your operation does not cause the patient pain.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach it, then it is necessary to align it with the end of a radius, on which a small swelling is present.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If the fracture is in both parts, then do likewise; and hasten its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at the quiet of a hot abscess.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce into the extremity of the nose a strip of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part; or introduce two strips if the fracture is in two parts; and let the strip have a thickness sufficient to fill the nasal opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that the strips should be steeped in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	However, that does not seem to me right; rather, the strip should be steeped in egg white, mixed with mill dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the strip until the bone is strengthened and the cartilage hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is introduced into the nose in place of a strip, after a soft cloth has been wrapped around it; and it is done so that it holds the fracture of the nose more strongly and so that the weak person is not hindered from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do it; and if you wish, do the strips.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If, while operating on a hot abscess, the nose happens again to be affected, plaster the nose with careton, or with cot infused in rose oil, or a little of diaquilon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	However, if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary to plaster it with sesame flour and powdered frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place soft lint over it, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If, however, the bones of the nose fracture or are broken into small pieces, then it is necessary to cut around them, and to extract them using instruments appropriate for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then stitch the wound, and treat it with that which causes flesh to grow and consolidates from suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs between the nostrils, then it is necessary to treat it with dressings, and administer a lead cannula until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and its fracture is not with a wound: then see if its fracture is only from the outside, and is not broken in two, and is bent inward: then its knowledge is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if its fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth. Similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand. And push the curvature of the fracture from within towards the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone properly, and with it straighten it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two, then it is necessary to apply an external force from both sides, according to the straightness, until its alignment is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, displacement or breakage has already occurred in the teeth, then bind those which you hope will remain with gold wire, or silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a poultice on the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a doubled cloth over it, and place a large, properly made bandage on top of the cloth, or a piece of leather sole of equal length to the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it from above, according to how its ligature is prepared for you and its application is appropriate, until it is not broken; and order the sick person to use tranquility and quiet; and give him soft drinks.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you estimate that something of its shape has already been altered in any way, then hurry and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then rectify what has been altered from it, and plaster it with mill dust, with the white of an egg, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the poultice, and place soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that plaster remains attached to it, and the arrangement of the bone does not change, leave it, do not loosen it, until it is healed; or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often tightened in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs in the meantime, then administer what we have said many times in its sedation, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	If a piece is already separated from the bone, or from the surrounding tissue, then be meticulous in this, so that you remove those pieces of surrounding tissue with whatever is suitable to you in removing them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If however the wound opening is constricted, then widen it with a phlebotome according to the amount of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed that surrounding tissue, and nothing remains of it, then the wound opening, if it is wide: and if not, place on it from the plasters that are suitable to it, and cause it to heal, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the Forcep, when it breaks.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the Forcep most often breaks at the anterior part, on the humeral side, and its fracture occurs according to one of three methods.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Either it breaks and separates into two, besides which some swelling may occur in it: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or in such a way that swelling occurs in the bone: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or in such a way that it is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in it, when the fracture is without a wound, is to have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the support that follows the fractured Forcep, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then adjust the fracture with your fingers, until its shape is as it should be: and there is neither a prominence nor a cavity in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then you must place a sphere made of cloth or wool under the patient's arm; and its size should be according to your need; and extend and lift the Forcep, and contract the sphere with your hand, until you adjust the fracture, as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot pull the end of the Forcep outward because it has reached deep inside, then the patient must be placed on their back, and you must place a pillow of medium size under their shoulder, and the assistant must press down on their shoulder until the bone of the Forcep that is deep inside is lifted upwards; and then straighten the fracture and adjust it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a splinter from the Forcep, and it moves, then you must cut above it and extract the splinter with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If however it is retained in the bone, then make an incision around it with one of the scalpels you have prepared for that purpose, after you have placed under the Forcep an instrument that keeps the sifach: and this is an instrument made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spoon that has no cavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to the size of the bone, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length, however, should also be according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If however the wound that you have made when you have extracted the bone fragment is wide, and you fear a hot abscess: then bring together the two edges of the wound with sutures.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the wound is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and small cushions, according to the size of the wound's opening.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot abscess should occur, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it over it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A bone fracture, however, when it is without a wound, and without incision, is treated by placing a plaster made from mill flour with egg white upon the bone.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place soft lint over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a ball under its (the bone's) raised portion, if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a himatema, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is very long, and let its width be one palm, or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled pad over the lint and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a thin board, whose width is of three fingers, and in length likewise.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the splint in the place of the alhimemati that falls over the fracture and the location.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the alhimemati over the fracture as it revolves, and wrap it over its neck, and under its healthy and under its diseased titillico: and reduce it over the entire part, and as you see that the constriction holds the fracture with a decent constriction: and that is what is not hidden from you, and the whole, so that the splint is not removed from above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason it is necessary that you observe the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Therefore, whenever the ligament softens, and you see the splint already being removed, then rectify it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sick person's sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his pillow at night, so that with it his support is raised from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	The fracture of the clavicle is therefore raised by raising the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck, and do not loosen the bandage if it does not happen in a place that is affected by itching or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster if you see his face towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the constriction, and leave him until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed the fracture of the clavicle is bound and strengthened most in twenty-eight days, and sometimes it happens in some people in a shorter time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured scapula.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The scapula is rarely fractured, and in its broad area, and only its margins are fractured from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	Therefore, when a part of it is fractured, and it is fractured in its middle, and that is not recognized except by touch, then, according to the nature of the fracture, attempt its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to its natural shape by every means of skill that is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place on the area flour of a mill with the white of an egg, and soft linen, and place a pad of doubled cloth over it.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place upon it a broad splint of thin wood, according to the size of the entire scapula, or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If, however, under the splint there is a concavity in any part of the scapula, then equalize that concavity with soft linen, until the splint descends according to equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind over it with a long bandage, with suitable constriction, and firmness of the splint, until it is not removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever, therefore, the bandage softens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it is removed from its place; and let the sick person lie on their healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And indeed the splint is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is completed, then loosen the bandage; and be you in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose connection is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however a piece proceeds from the bone, and pierces beneath the skin: then cut over it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said in the fracture of the furcula from the suppuration of a hot abscess, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured breast.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breast sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and that rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities are indeed broken and crushed very often from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is broken, bending downwards, it causes him intense pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps he vomits blood, and a cavity in the fractured bone becomes apparent, and not hidden from the senses. Its restoration is that the weak man be laid on his back; and a pillow be placed between his shoulder blades.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and grasp the ribs from both sides with your hands; and adjust its alignment, in every way possible and suitable, until the shape of the bone returns, as it should.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and a bandage on it, and place a thin board of willow, or chalice, or similar light material, upon it, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then adjust it in tying it over the broken bone so that it does not move; and proceed with the bandage in a circular fashion towards the back several times, and tighten it with a suitable constriction.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then check the bandage every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it; and if its need compels you to loosen it due to itching, or corrosion that occurs in the area, or pain, or abscess: then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and correct whatever has happened with its method of treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then replace the plaster, if you see fit: and apply a bandage to it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	Concerning the restoration of Ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur except in the thick parts which follow the spine, and from their extremities on the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And attrition does not happen to them unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from the sense in the investigation with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done so that one equalizes the fracture with fingers according to the possible manner, until the form is equalized, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters, and bind the fractured bone with splints, if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the rib fracture is slanting inwards, then severe pain and a stabbing sensation occur in the patient, like the stabbing sensation that occurs in those with pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane, and also there is difficulty breathing, and coughing, and the spitting up of much blood; and this is a difficult condition to treat.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients have already devised many methods for it; and some of them say that one should give the patient foods that produce inflammation and windiness, so that the belly will become inflamed, and expanded, and the fracture will be driven outwards.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We, however, abhor this, lest it become a quick cause for a hot abscess, if it does not already exist.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If, however, it has already occurred, then one should add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: place a windbag over the affected area, then suck it with force, and this is a similar reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the windbag will draw superfluities to the affected area, because of the weakened state.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: the affected area should be covered with wool that has already been immersed in hot oil; and cushions should be placed between the ribs, until it is filled; so that there is an even bandage when you wrap it around the curvature.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, through food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the strong action of the affliction the patient cannot tolerate, and the mouth stings with a wound caused by a sharp prick, and we fear for the patient, then it is necessary to make an incision over the affected area and expose the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we should place on it the instrument that preserves the sifac, whose description preceded; and we should cut the bone with ease, and cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we should bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures; and we should treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If, meanwhile, a hot abscess occurs, then hurry and infuse powders in rose oil, and place it on the affected area; and let the patient be treated with what is suitable for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, let him lie on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Concerning the restoration of the fracture of the spine of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	A fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the neck, and attrition rarely happens to them; and similarly with the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and numb, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you grasp them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and he does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in many cases is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them, and feels the contraction with your fingers and the pricking, then know that the bone of the neck is sound, and that the sick person will be cured with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If a similar condition occurs in the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will also heal or not, then consider his feet: if you see that they are softened, and that what happened to his hands has happened to them; then, when he lies on his back, wind and excrement leave involuntarily; and when he lies on his stomach, excrement leaves involuntarily; and when he lies on his back and wants to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not labour in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If, however, nothing of that happens to him, the condition is less severe.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what happens from that is to try to soothe the hot abscess, so that you place on the vertebra pounded rose oil alone, or with the yolks of a roasted egg.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place that upon it several times a day, until when the hot abscess subsides; then place upon the spot one of the strengthening, drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage; and order the sick person to use rest and quiet.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Nor should he sleep on the part where he found the pain until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens at the attrition of the bone, or something that has already separated from it, then it is necessary to dissect on the skin and remove that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some healing ointment until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If, however, the last bone of the alhausos breaks, and is the end of the tail, then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus, and straighten the broken bone with the other hand, as far as possible, and with a second adjustment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place it on top of it, and remove it; and treat the wound with the previous treatment until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	On the restoration of the Anchae.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the Anchae rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they do break, then their fracture is not complete, unless it is a shattering at their extremities; and they split lengthwise and bend inward; and pain and a puncture occur in the place, and the leg that is broken becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is to extend your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture as its figure is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at its extremities, then align that fracture according to what is prepared for you in the alignment, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If, however, the fracture is lengthwise, or already bends inward, then have the sick person lie on their stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have aligned it, place a plaster over it; then place a splint of wood or leather over it; and bind it tightly so that you do not fear the displacement of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And align the concavity of those with that which fills it, until the binding takes it according to equality; and command the sick person to sleep on their back, or on their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs to him, then cease from its extension and its restoration until the hot abscess subsides; and place upon it that which settles it, according to what has preceded, then return to its restoration; and bind it as is proper.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If, however, it happens in the bone that it is shattered, or broken, remove it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	On the restoration of the fractured arm.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The arm is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder blade.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two bandages are tied at the two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is suspended from a raised place, and the sick person sits upon a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should place his broken arm upon the wood, until it reaches the notch, in whose middle the curvature of the wood is attached.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend something heavy above it, so that the attendant extends it downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician should adjust the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns to the proper position.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that the sick person should lie on their back, and suspend their arm from their neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two attendants, that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with their hands, and that the other hold below it, and let each of them extend to their own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then bind below the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage, and let each of the two attendants extend to their respective sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the extremity of the humerus, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed beneath the armpit, and another beneath the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that a bandage be placed over that place, and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then adjust the fracture with ease without effort, until when the fracture is adjusted as it should be, and a good application is applied, then bind it, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place upon it cut wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess subsides: then bind it; and the manner of binding it is that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a bandage of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then let the arm be supported by that aid, and let him place his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and bind the arm over the support, so that the arm stands in place like the stars; if nothing hinders you from it, nor is anything disturbed on you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	But if you fear that something might be disturbed on you from the broken bone, then use splints: and it is that you place a splint over the fracture itself which is wider and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every splint the width of a finger; and the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind over the splints the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your bandage should be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is extended, the less tight the bandage should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the position of the splints and the bandage, as we have said, at the time when you restore the limb immediately, then do it; and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave the bandage and splints until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for all three days, so that itching or swelling does not occur in the area, or that food is prevented from reaching the limb, due to the disposition of excess fluid from the bandage.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore, rectify it all, according to what we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If, however, you are confident that nothing will happen from it, then do not loosen the bandage unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient's sleep be on his back, and his hands on his stomach; and place under his assistance a mattress full of wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at all hours of the night or day that the broken limb's form is not loosened or the bandage softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore, rectify all of it with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give the patient food according to the order we have previously described, so that the food is subtle at first, until the mouth begins to draw together; then it is necessary to increase the thickness of his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is customary for the leg and its support that it draw together in forty days; then therefore it is necessary that it be loosened, and a bath be administered, and it be medicated with ointments which rectify it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul, bruised, then do not loosen the bandage and splints from it until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forearm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of which is small; and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is that which is placed beneath the small one at the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore the larger forearm bone is broken alone, or the smaller one; and perhaps they are broken together.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller forearm bone is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the forearm bone is broken below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse than that is when the two bones are broken simultaneously.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm bone above, then it is fitting for the physician, in its restoration, to apply a small extension with ease, until he equalizes it.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the larger forearm bone is that which is broken: then it is necessary that he apply a much stronger bandage.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he place the shape of the hand in its restoration, and its extended extension on a cushion.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers, and let the lower joint be below all the fingers, or the rest, and the patient sitting square over himself, and let the cushion be before him, or in a straight line with him, in height, so that the patient does not incur fatigue.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the attendant should extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another attendant should extend it from above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should adjust the bone until he restores it to the best shape possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are fragments in the broken bone, then try to restore every fragment to its place by your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If, however, a separated fragment appears in it, and it pierces the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration for you: then cut over it, and remove it according to the manner which we have stated in the matters which have gone before.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If, however, the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a separate chapter concerning it, therefore take its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If in the beginning of your restoration a hot abscess occurs, then bind a cloth with a cerate made from rose oil and white wax, and let it be medium between thickness and thinness: and bind the cloth over it with a subtle bandage until the abscess subsides: then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from mill powder with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place splints, and let the splint placed over the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases, whether the fracture be in one or two joints at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage over the fracture location more strongly and forcefully, and somewhat more tightly at the upper or lower portions of the fracture: or place a softer bandage slightly less tight, as its description previously stated at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths that envelop the fracture be soft, damp cloths; and let them not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is tied be of linen, medium between fine and coarse, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And observe the limb and ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything should happen requiring correction, such as itching that occurs in the limb, then it is necessary to embrocate the limb with warm water until the itching ceases, and leave the limb unbandaged until it rests, then reapply the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage has now softened, and the bone has already been removed, and similar things to these: then correct it all with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of the excessive tightness of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and leave it for some days, until nourishment flows to it, then bandage it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	If however, nothing of what we have said happens to the patient, then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days, or about this many.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the patient's hand is to be suspended from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And his neck should be level, and kept by its own strength from violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All that is according to the dispositions of the complexions, and the dispositions of the strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Concerning the restoration of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fracture of the hand's knuckles and the joints of the fingers rarely occurs.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to them unless there is very frequent friction.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, when a fracture or abrasion of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the infirm person sit square, and a seat be in front of him, according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand upon it outstretched.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let the attendant extend the fractured bones, and let the physician adjust them until when they are joined with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he apply a plaster and lint, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a bolster over it according to the amount of space, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is towards the lower part, roughly the sole of the foot, then make a sphere from cloth, and command the sick person to tighten it over their fractured foot, then tie it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the bolster be of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather is applied to the foot's body, and bind it, as is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If however the fracture is outward, then it is necessary: that you place a bolster over it, and another bolster from below on the sole; and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place a bandage, as the hand is turned, and stretch it between the fingers with a ligature.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If, however, a fracture of any of the finger joints occurs, then if it is the thumb, it should be equalized as is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it should be bound with the sole; and if you wish, place a small straight bolster under it, so that the fracture is elevated and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it should be equalized, and bound with the healthy finger that follows it; or all should be bound according to continuity; and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small bolster on it, as we said about the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your treatment, and after the resolution of the hot abscess: and apply with it what is necessary, when anything from it occurs, according to the repetition of its account.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is frequently broken, and is revealed to the senses because it is turned inward and backward.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done so that the ligament above the fracture is tightened, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person should lie on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then the attendant should extend every ligament on its side according to equality; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If however the fracture is near the root of the hip, then the ligament should be on the side of the crest, so that the extension goes upwards; and another ligament beneath the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, then the ligament should be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician should align the bone with both his hands, until he restores it according to the likeness of its natural shape, and the bone is joined with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you apply a plaster and a bandage, if a wound does not happen to the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If however a wound does occur in it: then leave it for a few days, until the hot wound subsides, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	However, its bandage should be like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap a hard bandage over the fracture, that is, a binding, and double it twice, or thrice, and let some excess remain from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then bandage the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the lower part of the knee, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap the excess bandage around the leg and thigh.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place splints on the thigh, in the place of the fracture itself, and place one splint over the shin bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the tightness is equalized.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage, from the middle over the fracture site, with three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the further you move away from the fracture site with the bandage, the weaker and softer your binding should be.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then pull on the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Tie therefore with both ends the three splints that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then proceed with the two ends of the thread to the lower parts, until you reach the ankle.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both ends, tighten also the ends of the splints on the other side, so that the bandage does not shift from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then loosen the constriction over it, while it remains, so that no corrosion, or abscess, or swelling, or similar things befall the limb.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything of that sort should happen.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, hasten with its solution, and correct whatever happened from that, completely, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If, however, there is a piece of bone in the bone that pierces: then it is necessary that you should trim it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, split over it, and remove it: and treat it with what was previously mentioned, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is bound, besides which splints are added to it, as we have said in the case of the arm and the hand.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in its restoration, if thus fractured, lameness does not befall the sick person.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides which the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that the one whose it is should always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound in fifty days, or a little is added, or a little is diminished: all of that is according to the diversity of complexions, and the rest of the dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fractured kneecap rarely occurs, but attrition occurs to it many times.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If, however, a fracture occurs to it, then it is only either a fissure or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And the whole of it stands with feeling.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that the parts of it that are disrupted are made equal with the fingers, until they are aggregated and joined as much as is possible by means of equalization and ease, and fabrication.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster of sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white; and place a round piece of wood on it, if you need it; and bind it above with a suitable bandage.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions that we have described in other fractures, such as a hot abscess, and similar things: so that you oppose every accident with that which is appropriate to it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick, and is called the Crural bone; and the other thin, and is called the Tibial bone.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And both types of fractures happen to the two bones of the arm, and because of that its restoration is done, just as the restoration of the arm is done equally, and the operation is the same.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are broken at the same time, the leg is turned in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is turned towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone is broken, you find it lower; and it is from those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and alignment, and the ligature of splints according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having much blood: that there be less extension, and gentler alleviation on your part.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg indeed there is something from the operation above the arm: and it is, that when you align the splints, and complete all your operation, then take two bandages from pinewood, which is used in the fabrication of roofs that are placed under the boards: and they are made from the blades of palm trees: and choose from those which have small thickness, and neither be from small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap over each bandage with two wrappings according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two bandages in three places from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when constriction is prohibited, the leg inclines to the right and left, and stands in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed let a cradle be administered made of wood according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed upon it, so as to preserve it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed it is most necessary that you do this in a fracture when there is a wound properly with it.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and strive with the utmost care against an abscess, or swelling, or any other similar condition.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore anything of those things happens, then oppose it with what is necessary, until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture of the heel bone does not truly happen.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, fractures of the bones of the foot sometimes occur, and fractures of the toes also rarely occur; and they do not occur to them except for abrasion in many dispositions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture of the foot bones occurs, and you see those bones rising above each other, then the infirm person should place their foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then you stand and place your foot on that which is elevated from those bones; afterward press or tread on it, and straighten it until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a plaster, and linen over it; and place a small board under the sole of the foot, which has two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and whatever else it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones straightened, whether they were fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Therefore, the operation on them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If any fingers are broken, then restore them and straighten them according to what I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a splint along the length of the finger, and let it be a little wider than it; then place under the foot this board which I have told you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If, however, what is broken of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place a splint of its size over each finger, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board to the lower part of the foot; and let it stand upon one end of the board outside the sole of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it befits you, lest you forget, to consider all that I have said to you concerning other fractures from accidents that we have discussed, and to apply to every accident what is appropriate.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the os pectinis, and a man's penis.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's vulva is broken, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her slightly toward her back, and let her be held back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her vulva with wool, until it fills it: and let there be formed in the vulva from it like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that wool will come out, until it becomes like a sphere before the entrance of the vulva, and the broken opening returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a cushion on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	Therefore, when she wishes to urinate, remove the wool with ease, then let her urinate: and return it according to the manner in which you first introduced it: then let her return to her first cushion.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do that for seven days, or thereabouts, for the opening itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a reed cannula over its opening, and introduce the entire bladder into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the cannula with force, until the bladder inflates within the vulva, for the rupture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with wool, and let it remain for several days, according to what we have described, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the pubis of a man or a woman breaks, then administer in its restoration, and its equalization, that which we have described in the bone of the hip.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which rarely occur, especially for someone with some skill or experience.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand well this book of mine, because the fracture itself signifies to you in many situations the right path to its restoration and its healing: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	In the penis of a man, when it breaks, take the throat of a goose, and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place over it a wrapping of cloth, and let it be wrapped, and let it be left for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured bone when it is with a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It befits him who suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as a hip bone, or a femur, or similar to it, to be prompt, and to immediately bleed him: if the circumstances of bleeding warrant it, as we have previously stated.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound is flowing blood, then it is necessary to promptly cauterize it, using ground zegi, if another is not available.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin restoring the fracture on that same day, and do not postpone it, if no abscess has formed.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If, however, a hot abscess forms, then delay its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause him harm.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If, however, the broken bone is protruding above the skin, then it is necessary to attempt to reduce it and align it with your hands with ease and little extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, its extension and alignment with your hands is not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the measure of seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four, according to the quantity needed for the treatment of any type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be round, and have a small thickness, so that it does not double under compression upon it during the operation; and it should have a sharp tip with a margin at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And its upper part should be thickened from the middle of it down to the lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, its sharp curved end must be placed on the protruding bone end, and push it with it in one direction, until the bone returns and is equalized with a certain equality.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, try to align the fractured ends together.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its fractured ends are delicate and do not accept the instrument properly, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If, however, you cannot completely reduce them with what we have described, then cut it with whatever appropriate cutting instrument we have mentioned, or saw it with one of the saws in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small pieces.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When, therefore, the bone is reduced, and the infirm person finds intense pain, damaging him, after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
Fac ergo illud.	Therefore, do that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great benefit on the infirm person, when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then soak a cloth in astringent, black wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not put a bandage on the wound, nor anything containing oil, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the splints at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound uncovered; so that you cut with scissors a hole in the dressings according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with every precaution, lest you bind the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For often foolish physicians have done this, and have caused to befall their sick patients either death, or corruption, or *zuchem*, that is, pus.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your bandage be soft, gentle, different from the other bandages of the fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some bad accidents, which we have recounted, and find pain in a suspended place: then it is not necessary that you place splints over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them wrappings from hard cloths in place of the splints, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When however it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound already beginning to produce pus: then remove from over it the cloth which you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer bandages and ointments with which it is customary for us to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus flows from it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass over the wound, and it is not consolidated, nor is pus separated from it: then know that there are small bone splinters there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary to probe the wound with probes.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	However, remove any of those splinters that are separated, and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those of them that are not separated, and pierce the limb, and cause pain to occur, try to cut them out, and remove them by any means possible to you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If a wound suffers from ulceration, or ecchymosis, that is, festering, or any other type of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary to apply to each of them that which is suitable for it from the treatment, whose explanation preceded in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in that which my discourse should address, and to which you should pay attention when a bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, like the hip bone, and the auxiliary bones, and similar ones from the larger limbs, is that you should not attempt to pull it back; for often death results from it. Rather, leave it until it rots.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	For perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then, therefore, treat the wound, if it seems good to you; and if not, leave it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Concerning the treatment of a knot in the path of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This knot often happens in the course of the healing of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially those that are near the joints; and the shape of the limb is disfigured by it.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it hinders the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, if the knot is recent, apply to it medicines that have astringent properties, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar to them.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you may take some of these, or all of them: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them upon the knot in linen, and bind them tightly over it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the bandage, and do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and apply another, until the knot is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind over it a lead sheet properly.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	However, if the knot has already turned into stone, and is tight, and necessity quickly compels its removal: then split over it from above, and cut the protruding excess; or scrape it with certain razors, until it is removed; and care for it until it is healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Concerning the treatment when it is restored, and the limb remains after it subtle, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a fractured bone is restored, and the limb after it remains thin, weak: then it is not so except for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is, the multitude of the loosening of the ligament and its ligature not according to what is proper; or because of the excess of the constriction of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from running to the limb; or because of the multitude of unnecessary embrocation at an improper time; or because of the scarcity of blood in the body of the weak person, and his debility.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment of that is, to feed the weak person, and to make his body soft, until the blood is multiplied in him.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch upon the limb, so that the pitch draws to it much nourishment.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And assiduously embrocate it with tepid water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Concerning the treatment of broken bones when they are restored crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When, after the healing of a limb that has already been restored, crookedness, and a protrusion of the fractured bone, or a knot, occurs; and the form of the limb is disfigured thereby, yet the limb is not prevented from its natural function; then one should not accept the opinion of whoever thinks that the limb should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And many foolish physicians and bone-setters have already done that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed very reprehensible, leading to death, or great fear, so that it is deadly.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the limping and the knot are recent, then it is necessary to bathe it with lukewarm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marsh-mallow leaves and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And a plaster should be made with a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucilage of marsh-mallow root, and mix it with hen's fat, or sesame oil; and plaster it with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take fat figs, and grind them with pigeon dung, and similar things called medicines that diminish consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knot is loosened by diligent, long-standing, gentle friction, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the limb should be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If, however, twisting has already preceded, and become strong, and turned into stone, and the need has arisen to treat it with iron: then it is necessary that it be cut above it, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and that which is superfluous from the knot or bone be cut with very small knives; and ease should be administered to it with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Concerning the speech on Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter Twenty-Four.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the departure of any joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prevented from its movement, and the shape of the limb is marred.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes great pain and severe injuries to the weak.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore, when a dislocation occurs in someone, then one must hasten to restore it; nor should one delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes suppurated, and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation with it.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it is not appropriate to move or extend it during the time of its suppuration.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it often causes spasm and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then it is necessary to hasten to phlebotomy of the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be left until the abscess subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every limb should be treated with that whose recollection will come into its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already ordained the chapters on dislocation, even as it preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are rarely dislocated except rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For either they are removed from their places by a small removal, and softened a little.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation, until they soften to the side of the chest, until the sick person's saliva runs, and cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped up with his speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however the dislocation of it is small, then it returns in many dispositions by itself with little difficulty.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If however it is a complete, entire dislocation, then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not delayed at all: and it is that the minister hold the sick person's head, and the physician insert the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the dislocated jaw between his mouth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or let him insert two of his thumbs together, if the dislocation is on two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hands be outside, with which he will steady it.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick person to cleanse his jaws and allow them to move for eating in every direction.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician will steady the jaw and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are locked together, then administer vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is easy; and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are steadied, and the sick person's mouth is closed, and they do not soften: then place upon them pads of cloth, with a plaster made of wax and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it shall be bound with ease with soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the sick person's sleep be upon his back, and let his head be supported between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right and left, nor attempt or be forced to chew anything; rather, let his food be of a gentle liquid consistency, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is set, then let him eat what he wishes, and let it be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let him not exert himself upon the operation of his mouth in eating and drinking and yawning until the jaw is set and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult when they are dislocated at some time, and do not return to their places, then fever and constant perspiration often result; and perhaps the sick person's bowels are loosened, and perhaps they vomit pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore, when you see this, know that it is loss, and often the one to whom this happens dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The collarbone is indeed not dislocated from its inner side, because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is sometimes dislocated outward, and this is apparent to the senses.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the infirm person lie on their back and extend their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then, grasp the place firmly with the palm of your hand, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a plaster and bandages over it and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	However, its extremities that follow the elbow, and are continuous with it, are not dislocated, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If, however, it is dislocated on any day, then it is necessary that it be reduced and set in accordance with what we have said and what is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a plaster, bandages, and a binding over it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the sick person to adhere to tranquility and rest until healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment, the humerus extremity is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the Humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is that it is dislocated towards the armpit downwards.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it is dislocated towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the Humerus: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated to the rear, because of the scapula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated to the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And very often it is dislocated and exits downwards towards the tickle: especially in those whose flesh is few.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it emerges in them quickly, and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	In those, however, whose flesh is plentiful, it is the opposite, namely, because it emerges with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men through a blow, or a fall, and the humerus is ulcerated with a hot ulcer, and it is thought because of that, that it is now dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that you test it, until you stand on the certainty of it, and then proceed in its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And dislocation is known when it is towards the lower part, touching the skin: and distinguish between the dislocated humerus and the healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find a clear difference among them, and you find a concavity in the head of the humerus, and under the skin, touching the head of the humerus, as if it were an egg itself; and the afflicted person cannot bring the hand to their ear, nor move it in all directions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards, then you find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed, a simple reduction of this dislocation is possible when it is recent, or the affected person is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is to raise the hand of the attendant upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under its skin, and raise the joint with strength upwards to its place; and let the attendant raise their hand, and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then place it lower, for it returns quickly itself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	However, if it does not return through what we have said, and there have been many days since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the affected person bathe in warm water, and that an embrocation be administered which softens and soothes, such as if roots of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the sick person shall lie supine on their back; and a sphere and wool, which shall be equal between softness and firmness, shall be placed under their skin.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician shall place their heel on the sphere, and lift the head of the shoulder with strength, and pull the sick person's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another attendant shall hold the sick person's head, so that it does not move downwards; for it returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: and it is to be done by having a man present who is taller than the sick person, and standing at the side, and inserting his shoulder under the sick person's armpit; and lifting their armpit upwards, until the sick person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another attendant shall pull the sick person's hand downwards towards their abdomen.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If however the sick person is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with them, so as to weigh them down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that a long piece of wood is fixed in the ground, whose head is round in shape, like the sleeve of a mortar; which should not be thick, nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then, a soft cloth is placed under the sick person after being placed on the head of the wood; and the sick person stands along the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then, the sick person's hand should be extended downwards on one side, and the body extended on the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If its reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is that you should take a piece of wood whose length is the measure of two arms, and its width the measure of four fingers, and its thickness the measure of two fingers; to which there should be a round head, so that its entry into the depth of the socket is alleviated, according to this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then, soft cloths are tied to the round head, so that the wood does not injure the sick person.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then, place the wood under the sick person's socket, so that the hand or arm is extended downwards over the wood; and tie the wood to the support, arm, and hand's extremity.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then, place the arm on a step of a ladder in width, and extend the hand downwards, and let the rest of the body hang suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The joint immediately enters.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When, therefore, its entry is completed in whatever way is possible, then it is necessary that you place a sphere of equal quantity of wool under the socket.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared plaster from the mill's powder with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it revolves from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind a suitable bandage under the socket, and wrap the bandage over the plaster from above; and tie its hand to its neck, and let it hang, and do not move its hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that little food be given to the sick person until the limb is strengthened, because this is more rapid for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one is placed after seven days, or five, and is exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If, therefore, it is strengthened and does not soften, then it is now healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If, however, the joint is dislocated repeatedly, due to the moisture that occurs in it, or due to another cause, then it is necessary that a cautery with three openings be administered to it, according to what has been previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all this is done, and the ligament loosens after seven days, and the joint does not strengthen, and the plaster and constriction are applied to it repeatedly, and it does not strengthen, and it falls, and it cannot raise itself upwards, then know that the nerves belonging to the head of the humerus are now cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	The reduction of dislocations occurring towards the breast and nipple, or towards the back, is performed with pushing and pulling with the hands, until it returns, and the remaining constriction and care are administered to it until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If, after healing, heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness in its movement, then let the infirm use the bath repeatedly until that heaviness is lessened and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	Concerning the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty.  It dislocates in all directions, and especially forward or backward.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you, because it is evident to the eye and to the touch, whatever the configuration of the dislocation.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow to the sound one, that will be evident to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is hollowed out, and cannot double the arm, nor can it touch its own shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hurry and reduce the dislocation promptly, before a hot abscess occurs in it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess occurs in it, its reduction becomes difficult, and perhaps it will not be healed at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all other types of dislocations, and more painful than them: and often death comes with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it, when it is of those that can be reduced, is that his hand should be extended with two hands, and his arm be stretched out, and the physician's hands be above and below the elbow, and he should press the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or indeed the dislocation is towards the front: then it is restored thus, that he should double his hand with his hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a very strong, forceful extension; and it is that two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants should hold him as well, so that he is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is to be revolved in every direction after a long doubled cloth, or a wide bandage, has been wrapped around his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with oil, so that it may be of those things which aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should drive the joint with a forceful impulse until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, a plaster containing astringency and desiccation with egg white should be placed upon it, and bound with a suitable bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the sick person's neck, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be released.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint is firmly fixed in its place, then release the bandage from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not being properly bound, then apply the plaster and bandage again, and leave it for a few days, until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then release it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If, however, after the reduction of the joint, heaviness occurs, and the condition is in motion, then administer moistening in bathing, and gentle friction and compression until it is lined, or place on the joint a fattened ram's buttock, that is, an iliac.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bandage it, and leave it over it by day and by night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and introduce it into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When therefore it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat over it with aleliati once, and twice, and thrice with the entrance into the bath, until it is soothed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place upon it a moist, warmed cow dung with butter, and wrap over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it is soothed, and returns to its proper condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The joint between the arm and hand, the Mahassem, is often dislocated.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	In contrast to other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, speed is necessary in reducing its dislocation at the time it is dislocated, before the site becomes suppurated, or a hot abscess occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the weak hand's Mahassem on a table, and the assistant extends his hand, and the physician places his palm over the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already receded towards the hand's stomach; then let the weak person place the back of his hand on the table at the time of extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let his hand's position be interiorly on the table, that is, the inside part of his hand be placed on the table, so that the physician's hand falls on the very prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If therefore it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster for the abscess, and leave it, and do not repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate it, nor can you achieve its reduction after days have passed, but the joint remains according to its twisting, and does not harm the sick person in any way other than that the hand becomes soft and cannot grasp anything, then know that the nerves are severed, or frayed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore there is no remedy for it, except to be cauterized near its location.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not contribute anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore the Almahassem does not return, then put upon it the plaster, which we have narrated.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then let it be cauterized, and let it be left for five days; afterward let it be released and left, and let the hand be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	However, if its movement is deprived, and something serious happens to it, then gently treat it with warm water, and friction several times, until it is soothed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the Fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter Thirty.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated from its place in any direction, or a finger is dislocated toward the back of the palm or the front of it, then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is straightened on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore it is night, bind it according to the description itself: and do not cease to loosen it in the day: and exercise it with motion: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for several days, until it is strong.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly do with it, if it is dislocated to the palm of the hand: and bind it to the part itself, and perform your first operation upon it, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly do with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the spinal column.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the spinal column, or the neck, has a complete dislocation, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure in it, because death is imminent for the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And a sign of this is that the excretion of the sick person emerges without their will, and they cannot hold it: and often some of his limbs are softened, or his two legs, or his two arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it is removed, for often their removal occurs in four directions.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed backwards is called a hump.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	However, its treatment is that you should then consider, if the hump occurs from childhood: then there is no treatment for it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	However, in that which occurs from an accident, or a blow, or similar things to these, the ancients have already described methods of treatment in lengthy speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which much does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I, however, have already abbreviated it, of which little excuses from much of it, from my closeness to the intention: and by my exposition in which I have explained it, and formed its instrument in a different way from that in which they showed it and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	Therefore, I say that in a hump which occurs on the front part, there is no skill, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which is made on both sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not treated from them, unless that which occurs on the back properly, with what I relate: and it is, that the sick man should be extended on his face on a level platform near a wall: and wet straw should be spread beneath him, so that his chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood, fixed in a hole in the ground, at the end of the platform, about the level of his head: and another piece of wood about the level of his feet at the other end of the platform: and let the attendant hold the wood, and let it not be firmly fixed in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another attendant hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap a soft, firm bandage around the head of the sick person, and under his armpits: and extend the end of the bandage to the wood which is by his head: and tie it to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten another bandage above his armpits, and above his knees, and at his ankles.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages together, and tie them to the other piece of wood which is by his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let every attendant extend the bandage to the side of the wood, and let the two pieces of wood not be moved from the places where they are fixed: but let them not be firmly secured, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician should place his palms on the vertebra with force, until it returns to its place; or place a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he ties his feet to the board, until it returns to its place.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, it does not return through this treatment, then take a board whose length is approximately three arms' length.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And hollow out in the wall, of which we said that it is near the sick person, a place for the end of the board to enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the vertebra.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And tie it well, until the vertebra is constricted, and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then, if you wish, work with a lathe that is wrapped with your hand: and it is, that you fix into the ground near the head of the sick person at the furthest end of the platform two pieces of wood, whose length is that of one arm; and near his head at the furthest end of the platform two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the length between each piece of wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in each place, through which the lathe runs; and let all the wood be firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let a round piece of wood be inserted; and the lathe is in which the ligament revolves in the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is a palm along with that which revolves; and in the other two pieces of wood is similarly that of it.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligaments that you have tied around the chest of the sick person on the lathe that is near his head; and the ligaments that you have tied around his legs on the lathe that is near his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let a servant stand by each lathe, who shall turn his hand with the rope, with which the lathe revolves; and let the physician adjust the Spondyle, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the lathe, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, after the Spondyle has returned and the place is adjusted, it is necessary that you apply a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then linen.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place a small board over the plaster, whose width is three fingers, or approximately that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length the quantity that takes the place of the Hump, and over the healthy part of the Spondyle.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then bind it with the bandage we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the sick person use delicate nourishment until they are healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If something of prominence remains in the place at the end of the healing, then it is necessary that medicines that soften and soothe be administered, with the administration of the board that we described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a lead plate is administered to it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes a prominence occurs in the final part of the spine of the back; and it is thought to be a dislocation, and that is the bone that is now prominent.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore, it is not appropriate that a presumption be made for it with this medicine; for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocated shoulder.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that the articulation of the shoulder, and the articulation of the humerus, does not happen, except for dislocation alone; nor does it happen to them what happens to the other joints from a small displacement and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the shoulder joint is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated forward, and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And it is most dislocated inwards; and it is little dislocated forwards, and backwards.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation inwards is: because when you join the healthy leg of the weak one with the weak one, it is longer; and his knee is more prominent than that of the healthy one, and the weak one cannot bend his foot at the groin; and there is a place which follows the groin, suppurating with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of him who has experienced a dislocation outwards is that his symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him who has experienced a dislocation forward is that he stretches the healthy leg to its fullest extent; however, he does not bend it without pain which is in the knee; and if he attempts to walk, he cannot step forward over it; and his urine is retained, and his groin suppurates, and in walking his foot is on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him who has experienced a dislocation backward is that he does not extend his knee, nor can he bend it before bending his groin; and his leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of these types of dislocation, however, is that you must then consider if the dislocation is old, which has already become established in the sufferer.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains in its position, then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it is not appropriate to make a complete presumption about it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	However, in the case of someone whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four types of dislocation, then hasten to this, so that you can grasp the joint, and extend it inwardly and outwardly, and move it right and left; for perhaps it will return, and will not require any further treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If, however, it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, and have him extend the leg from the lower part, either with his hands or with a bandage tied above the leg above the knee, and another assistant extend his hand from above, so that he places his hands under the person's toes.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie with a soft bandage over the root of the thigh, and hold the other end of the bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let the extension be either from the front of the groin to the part of the crotch, or from the back to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of all of them be at one time, until the sick person is raised with their body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this type of extension is a common type of the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type that I will say about its own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction of it indeed, when the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that the sick person be laid on their healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then let a bandage be placed over the root of the thigh, in that which is between the head of the thigh, and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the fork.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong attendant take his arms, and lessen the thick place of the sick person's thigh, and extend it outward with a violent extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For now it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the other types of treatment, by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	However, if it resists you and does not obey you in entering with this type of treatment at all: then it is necessary that the two feet of the sick person be bound together with a strong, gentle bandage, over the two heels and over the two knees; and the length of each [bandage] from its partner should be the quantity of four fingers; and the sick leg should be extended by more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the sick person be suspended over a piece of wood that is in the house; and its length from the ground should be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong young man to secure the head of the thigh; and let another young man be suspended with the sick person; and let another young man, securing the thigh with strength, drive it, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	However, in its own return, when the dislocation is to the outside, it is necessary that the sick person lie on a platform, according to what we have described in the case of a hunchback.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And a bandage should be tied around his sick leg and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two pieces of wood should be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let a piece of wood be placed added in the middle of the platform, firmly fixed; upon which let moist cloths be wrapped, so that it does not harm the sick person; and let the wood be between his thighs, so that it is not pulled downwards during the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let each attendant pull towards their side, and the physician adjust the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it yields to the return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place it upon the board itself, and press it, as we have said concerning the curvature, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick person lie on their healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary that the leg of the sick person be stretched quickly: and it is according to this same account upon a platform: and let the physician place the palm of his right hand upon the groin of the sick person.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he constricts it with the other hand, and with that constriction places it extended downwards to the part of the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is towards the back, then it is not necessary that the sick person be extended downwards and be raised from the ground; rather, it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard thing, as is necessary, as is also done if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to that which we said about his lying upon his two hips: and it is upon his face, and the ligaments extended, according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be administered with a board also upon the place to which the joint emerges, when the reduction is completed according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend the two legs of the sick person; and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his leg and expands it without excuse: then know that the limb is now returned, as it should be; then join the two hips, and place a plaster, and bind with a bandage, that is, a roller: so that the hip does not move to any parts; and let the sick person adhere to rest for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in condition, then know that the dislocation is now firm; therefore release the sick person to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening, then return and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding; and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make him/her slow in walking on both legs for several days, until it is strengthened well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Concerning the dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outwards, inwards, and downwards, namely backwards.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forwards.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And a sign of its dislocation is that you should instruct the sick person to apply their leg to their thigh.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If however it does not adhere to the thigh: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all the ways of its dislocation is that you make the sick person sit upright, so that if he can, he extends his leg over it, and you adhere your back to his face, and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make him adhere his knee with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another attendant should extend his leg until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh with gentleness, not with hardship.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it, and make the leg adhere to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then loosen them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the infirm person not use walking for some days, until healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If however its reduction is refused to you, then administer a strong extension with bandages, whose account preceded in the treatment of a dislocation, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel sometimes is moved by a small displacement, and sometimes is dislocated according to its full extent.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its displacement is easy through returning it: and it is that it be gently extended with the hands, and brought to its place, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	However, in treating it when it is dislocated completely, it is necessary to have the sick person sit upright, and a strong assistant hold them firmly from the back of their spine, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then, take the foot from above with your right hand, and with your left hand from below the foot at the ankle joint.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left hand, twice.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left hand, and push the foot's chest with the right hand towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the foot's chest towards the leg for the third time, and you pull the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns in one time, or in two according to this manner, and you see the foot made even, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation upon it, because it returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however its reduction is prohibited to you with that which we have said: then cause the sick person to lie on his back on the ground, and fix a very firm peg in the ground, so that it falls between his thighs: and you have now wrapped a cloth around him, so that he does not injure the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the attendant take his thigh; afterwards let the attendant extend the foot, either with his hands, or with a bandage which binds on the foot's ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all the attendants extend against the extension of their counterpart; and let the peg stand between the sick person's two thighs, holding him, so that his body is not pulled downwards at the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician shall correct the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant shall hold the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	Therefore, when the dislocation returns, and its return is declared to you as health, then apply a plaster and lint, and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or fear the nerves that are above the posterior heel, so that the bandage is not too tight on them and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament softens, bind it again; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and prohibit the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If, however, he attempts to walk before that period, there is no security that the dislocation will not resolve on him, and become corrupted, and not receive cure afterward.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If a hot abscess occurs to him, then it is necessary that you administer to it the treatment described earlier in our account elsewhere, and a poultice, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated of them be set back in place with a little extension, without effort; and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	However, if the dislocation is in some nodes of the back of the foot, then it is necessary that the sick person place their foot on a level place, or on a board; and it stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and place your foot on that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with force, until it returns, and you see it now set in place, and no protrusion appears in the location.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under the sole of his foot a board that encompasses the entire foot, having two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and allow him to rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and secured from the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Concerning the types of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of that sort occurs, and you attempt its treatment and restoration, often death results.  Therefore, one should not undertake such treatment unless one is experienced in the art, compassionate, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous; and should use at the outset only medications that soothe hot abscesses, and leave the infirm to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see, or hope for, salvation from destruction with the easing of the illness, and in which something appears hopeful.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If, therefore, the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that soothes the abscess, and treat the wound with whatever drying ointments are suitable for it.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If, however, the dislocation is with a fracture, and separate bone protrusions occur, then attempt to remove them, and do in that case what we have said regarding simple illnesses from what has preceded in their locations.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware, according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, according to what my instruction has preceded for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more salutary for your body among those in your time.
