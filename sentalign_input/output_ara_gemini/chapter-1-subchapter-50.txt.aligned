Chapter fifty on cauterizing cancer.	CHAPTER FIFTY. On cauterization for cancer.	0.8489776
If the cancer is in its early stages and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around it as it rotates.	When the cancer is in its initial stage and you wish to arrest it, burn all round the circumference of the cancer with the circular cautery.	0.8656328
Some physicians have mentioned that it should be cauterized with a deep cautery in its center, but I do not see that because I expect it to ulcerate. And I have witnessed that several times.	Some doctors have said that it may be cauterized with one extensive cauterization in the middle. This hardly seems right to me, for I should expect it to ulcerate out; which I have several times seen.	0.82173663
So the correct way is to cauterize around it in a circle as we said, or with many cauterizations.	So it is correct to burn around the circumference with a circular cautery as we have said, or with multiple cauterizations.	0.86536
