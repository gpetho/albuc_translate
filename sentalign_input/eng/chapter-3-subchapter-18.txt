 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.
On fracture of the female pudenda and of the pubic bone and of the male organ.
 When a woman's pudenda are fractured, make her sit cross-legged, then bend her backwards little by little, being supported from behind.
Then let a midwife pack the vulva with cotton wool so as to form a kind of spherical packing in the vulva.
Then shake the woman and by degrees elevate the dorsal spine, for the cotton wool will emerge until it is like a sphere at the opening and the fractured bone will be reduced.
Then put a pillow upon her back and when she wants to pass water gently remove the cotton wool so she may do so, then put it back in the same way in which it was put in at the first.
Then she should return to her pillow as before.
She should do this for about seven days, then it will be mended.
If you prefer, take a sheep's bladder and bind a hollow reed to the opening of it; introduce the whole bladder into the pudenda and then blow hard into the tube so that the bladder is inflated within the passage and the fracture will then be reduced.
Then pack with cotton wool and let her wait a few days as we have described, until it be healed.
Now when a man or woman has the pubic bone broken you can use for the setting and repair of it the method we gave for a fracture of the hip.
The correct practice in these uncommon fractures, which very rarely happen, will be obvious, especially to one who has some experience and understands well this book of mine.
For the fracture itself will in most cases indicate the correct way to repair it and bind it up, so use your intelligence.
When a man's organ is fractured, take a goose's neck and introduce the penis into it; then let it be wrapped and bandaged and left for about three days until it be healed.
