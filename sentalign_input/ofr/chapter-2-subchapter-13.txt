of the rotting of the eye
When this disease, which is called "alacratia" or rotting, affects the eye, there are two types:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it occurs from a sudden wound, or a cut, or a cautery, and similar things.
And the method of treatment is that you cut open that seam/suture, and separate its lips/edges, and put linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and you must not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict.
For if you do this, the illness will return worse than the first time;
but treat it with softening things, such as fenugreek;
and bathe it with water in which marshmallow and linseed have been boiled, and ointments of melted diachylon in some oil, and wrap a tent in it, and treat it with this.
And the key to your treatment is to be careful that it does not heal in the same shape as it was before; 
and this work that we have described is nothing other than the correction of this illness, so that it does not return in the form it was before.
