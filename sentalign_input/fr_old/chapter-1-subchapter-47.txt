of leprosy
Leprosy is sometimes greatly helped by cautery, especially the disease that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy. When you see it and want to cauterize, check if the disease is at the beginning, and if it is treated as we have said in the division, and it does not go down or stay, and you fear that the corruption will affect the whole patient, then make five cauteries on the head: one in the middle of the head at the top, and the other toward the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two horns, and one behind on the occiput; and leave your hand there long enough for the cautery to reach the bone, and for the scabs to come off so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape; and cauterize the spleen according to what was said before.
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere; and it is clearly visible, it is necessary to cauterize it with those cauteries we mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the top of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and another next to it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the chest, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands; and be careful not to burn the nerves that are on the backside, and sometimes make a cautery on the pubic bone, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more you help, and the more it benefits; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery as the healthy do, because the body is already entirely corrupted. And the cauteries must be large and small according to the members and joints, as you will find in the manner of the tools. Afterward, treat the area with vetch flour with honey and other treatments until it is healed.
