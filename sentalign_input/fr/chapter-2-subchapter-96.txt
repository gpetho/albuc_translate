Of bleedings from cupping
Cupping glasses are made of horn, brass, or glass; and cupping is done in two ways: either by pricking and drawing blood, or without pricking.
And this cupping that is without pricking is done in two ways: either with fire, or without fire;
and cupping that is done by pricking and drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body,
of which one is on the head; and the other is in the middle of the neck;
and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cup below the chin;
and the cups on the two shoulders; and the cup on the loins;
and the cups in the middle of the two arms; and the cups on the two legs;
and the cups on the two ankles; and cupping does not draw blood, except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh,
and therefore it does not weaken one, as bloodletting from a vein does;
and it is not necessary for it to be administered, neither with fire nor without fire, in any disease that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of diseases it is necessary to cup, or by custom, we will administer it at each hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle and at any time;
because there are those who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are those who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in their neck, and dimness in their eyes;
and those who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood;
and there are those who dream, and see by night blood and wounded and dead and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we recommend cupping after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting of the scalp helps with the heaviness of the head ... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary for it to be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of the bloodletting of the cephalic vein,
and it is not necessary for those who are of a cold complexion to use it, or who have catarrh, because it greatly harms them;
and therefore it is not necessary for the elderly to use it, nor those who have cold diseases in the head.
And those who are often bled with it, become forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cup a little lower to avoid forgetfulness.
The cupping in the middle of the neck is in place of the bloodletting of the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for the constriction of the chest,
and the fissure of the bronchial tube, and cough, and repletion;
and it is necessary to press it lightly, because if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or stomach and heart problems.
The cupping on the two sides of the neck is good for head pains, and ophthalmia and migraine, and strangulation, and pain in the roots of the teeth,
and it is in place of the bloodletting of the basilic vein; and it is necessary to instruct the bloodletter to press his hand when placing it, so that he does not cut the artery, and bleeding does not occur.
The cupping below the chin is good for mouth diseases, and gum corruption, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; and it is in place of the bloodletting of the two lips.
The cupping on the shoulders is good for diseases that come from heat and repletion.
The cupping on the elbows is as good as the bloodletting of the three veins of the arm,
because it draws blood from these large veins;
and instruct the bloodletter not to prick too deeply, because the place is bare of flesh, and nerves and arteries are underneath.
The cup on the loins is good for hemorrhoids of the anus, and diseases below, and it is necessary for the cup to be large, and made of brass, because it needs to draw well; and perhaps, if it were fine, it would break; and it makes large wounds.
The cups on the legs bleed openly, because they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the kidneys, and the womb, and the bladder, and bring back the menses; and they are in place of the two saphenous veins, and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in many situations.
The way to apply the cup is to place it first empty, and suck lightly, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not stop doing this, until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears; then prick, and replace the cups, and be careful with the disposition of the bodies, because there are those who have tender flesh, and clear pores: then it is necessary to prick only once, and make large wounds, and a little deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to prick twice: the first time to refine the way for the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to prick a third time; and when we want to draw a little blood, it is sufficient to prick only once.
And if we want to draw a lot of blood, we repeat often; and if the blood is thick, prick deeply, and the end is that the heart is pierced suddenly,
and it is necessary for one who has thick and hard skin, and narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cups with opening and dissolving oil:
if it is in summer, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or gourd seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with watercress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the superfluities are thick and cold, take amaranth oil, or balsamite oil, or dill oil, and the like.
And if the one being bled has tender flesh and large pores, it is not necessary to apply oil,
but it is necessary to wash him after the cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or gourd water, or purslane water, or something similar.
And those who have a lot of moisture, rise from wormwood, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities rise from old wine, or elder water, or dill or chamomile decoction, or others similar;
and it is not necessary to bleed with a cup before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath one or two hours; and do not sleep after the cupping,
and it is necessary to be cautious, when he should be cupped and when he is cupped.
And be careful if the one being bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed;
then it is necessary to take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuce with wormwood, and similar things;
and eat chickens, and castrated meat, and moist foods.
And those who have a cold complexion, take honey syrup, and medium-scented wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chickens and small birds and pigeons;
and on the day he will be cupped, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some people sometimes theriac or nutmeg before cupping, or after, to comfort the principal members;
and let the blood be refined, but it is not necessary for those who are hot to drink it.
The cups that are applied without pricking are those that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen, and on gout, and on the stomach and the abdomen and the kidneys and the hips, because those members do not tolerate pricking well,
and it is only done to draw blood from one member to another,
as we place them on the breasts when the nose bleeds; to remove the viscosity that is in the member, as we place cups on the stomach and the abdomen to reduce the member;
and it removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or moves the stone from its place;
and so it does when it is placed on the liver and on the spleen when there is retained wind,
and these cups are administered empty to suck only; and sometimes they are administered with fire, and sometimes filled with warm water,
as in diseases of pleurisy, and in such a manner that the cup is filled with pure warm water, or water in which herbs suitable for this have been boiled.
The shape of the cup administered with fire is this:
It should be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and have on the side around the middle a small hole, like to insert a needle,
and it should be of brass, smooth in front so that it does not hurt the patient when placed on the member;
and it should have in the middle a transverse rod of brass or iron, to place a lit candle,
and there should be large and small ones according to the diseases and the age of those who take them;
because the cups for children are different from those for the old, and for the thin than for the fat.
And one should place this cup on the member in this way:
take the candle of wax or a wick, and place it in the middle of the cup across the rod that is in the middle of the cup,
so that the flame is at the bottom of the cup so that it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the member, and your fingers should be on the hole we mentioned, so that when you want, the vapor goes out, and you remove the cup;
and take the wick as before, and repeat often, if you need to.
In the cup that is administered in disease of pleurisy, with water, there is no rod or hole, and it is only administered when it is full of water, and placed on the member only;
and this is the shape:
