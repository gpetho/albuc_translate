When pain occurs in the hip area due to cold and humidity, and the patient is not cured by previous treatments, then the patient should be purged of thick humors with fetid pills or similar remedies; and then cauterize.	When pain occurs in the hip joint and is due to cold and humidities, and the patient has been treated by those means mentioned in the section, and the treatment is ineffectual, and the pain becomes chronic, the patient should be purged of the heavy humours with foetid pills or pills of tamarind or the like; then cauterize him.	0.8151052
The method of cauterization can be of two types: cauterization with burning medicines or cauterization with fire.	The means of cauterization in this case is twofold: either with caustic chemicals or with fire.	0.82532954
There are two known methods, one of which involves cauterizing the hip area with three triangular cauterizations; and make them deep. The space between each cauterization should be the width of a finger, and the cauteries should be olive or large.	The actual cautery will serve for several methods. One of them is to make three cauterizations over the femoral joint itself in a triangular manner ; and let them be of a fair depth; and the space between them a finger's breadth. The cautery should be an olivary one.	0.8379807
Sometimes the cauterization should be on the middle spot on the hip joint, resulting in four cauterizations.	Sometimes there will also be one cauterization in the middle over the actual head of the femur, making four cauterizations in all.	0.77725905
If you prefer, cauterize with a circular cautery as described for hip dislocation, ensuring it burns through the entire scab.	The burning may be done with the circular cautery which has been mentioned under cauterization of a dislocated hip; a single cauterization so that the circle embrace the whole joint.	0.62973225
This is the method for cauterizing sciatica when the pain is in the hip and not extending into the thigh.	This is the form of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized in the hip joint and does not extend to the femur and the leg.	0.8571897
But if the pain extends into the thigh, then cauterize with two cauterizations on the thigh where the pain is located; and with one cauterization on the ankle, four fingers from the outer side.	But if it extends to the femur and the leg, cauterize him over the thigh with two burns at the place where the patient indicates the pain to be; and one burn four fingers above the great tendon of the heel, a little to the outer side.	0.81342673
If the cautery is knife-like, the depth should match the thickness of the scab.	The cautery should be edged, and the depth of the burn only to the thickness of the skin.	0.60239697
If the pain extends to the toes, then cauterize at the point of pain with three or four cauterizations, or more if necessary.	But if the patient points out that the pain reaches to the toes, then cauterize where he has indicated to you, with a punctate cautery, three or four or more perforations if he needs it.	0.7580562
If the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize there with one knife-like cautery.	If he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the shank, give him one burn there with the edged cautery.	0.7526955
Be careful in all cauterizations not to burn nerves or large arteries, as this can cause harm or contraction in the patient.	Be careful in all your cauterizing not to carry the cautery so far as to burn a nerve or a large artery; for thence arises grave harm, or crippling, to the patient.	0.85874414
I have seen cases where cauterization on the ankle resulted in severe swelling extending to the foot, causing perforation and corruption of the entire foot. This often led to severe diarrhea and eventually death.	I myself have seen more than one person cauterizing over the tendon of Achilles, the cauterization being excessive, and the leg was affected with a defluxion of humours which eventually reached the foot and the whole was riddled; after that came diarrhoea, and, after that, death.	0.69084466
If the pain is in two places simultaneously, cauterize each area in the same manner.	If there is pain in two places, cauterize both in this way.	0.84680194
Some experts describe a hip cautery shaped like a circular iron, half a palm in circumference, with an opening the size of a date stone or slightly smaller.	Certain learned doctors have mentioned a cauterization applicable to the hip in this manner: make a bowl of iron with a diameter of half a span; the thickness of the edge of its mouth should be that of a date-stone or a little less.	0.7407033
Inside this circle, there is another third; the space between them is the size of a walnut; these circles are open on both sides; their length is one or two nuts; these are well-made iron rings; this is their form:	Another bowl is introduced into this, and a third into that; and there is a distance between the bowls of a thumb-joint. The bowls are open on both sides; and the depth of them should be a thumb-joint or two. Make an iron handle for them firmly fitted to the bowls. Here is the figure.	0.7784099
Then, heat in the fire until it is red and sparkles, and then place it on the hip area, with the patient lying on their healthy side. Then cauterize with three round cauterizations at once.	Then heat this cautery in the fire until it is hot and sends out sparks; and so let it be applied to the hip, the patient lying on his sound side; and thus three circular cauterizations will be produced at a time.	0.81259763
Leave it for three days; then apply a poultice and leave the wound open for several days; and treat with ointments until healed.	Afterwards let it be for three days; then smear with butter and leave the wound open for a while; then treat with ointment till it heals.	0.9132507
Albucasis says: "Oh, sons, we rarely use this type of cauterization due to the fear of its effects and because few patients can withstand it."	The author of this book says that we very rarely employ this method of cauterization on account of the ugliness and dread appearance of it, and because we find few patients who will endure it.	0.65796256
But it is effective for those who endure it and locate the source of the pain.	Nevertheless, it is one of the best cauteries for him who can endure it and is correctly treated by it.	0.5264626
Another type of cautery involves using two circles with perforated armules through which iron pins are inserted; their length should be two nuts or close to it.	Cauterization with caustics is thus: make two bowls like the ring into which a door-hinge descends, either of bronze or iron.	0.6036866
The space between each should be the width of a finger; they should be open on the top and bottom, fitting together in this manner:	The height of their sides should be two thumb-joints or thereabouts, and they should be separated about a finger's breadth; they should be open above and below, and joined one to another thus.	0.7892066
Place on the hip area, with the patient lying on the healthy side, and press your hand on the hip area; then pour hot water between the two circles, gradually heating it with a small fire, keeping it for an hour, and the patient should endure the biting and burning sensation — which feels like fire — until the biting stops.	Then place them over the capsule of the hip joint, the patient lying upon his sound side, and press down hard; then pour caustic fluid between the two rings—it should have been heated slightly—and keep it there for the space of one hour by the sand-clock. The patient must endure the sting and heat of it (for he will find it stings like fire) till the causticity diminishes.	0.8314837
Then remove your hand with the instrument and wash off the hot water from the entire hip area with fresh water.	Then remove your hand with the instrument and wash away the caustic from the whole capsule with pure water.	0.8216003
Leave it for three days and apply a poultice until the burn's blackness disappears, leave it for a few days, and pus will drain; this is the final aid.	Let be for three days and apply butter to it till the eschar comes away; and let the pus flow from it for a few days, for that will be more conducive to healing.	0.7207986
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.	Then treat with ointment till it heals.	0.9780515
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, use the same method as for the hip.	If the pain extends to the hip joint or the leg, make a form in some material that will hold the fluid for that, just as you did for the capsule of the femur.	0.66168386
This is the hot water method, which I have already described in the treatise on medicine correction. Prepare alkali and unslaked lime in equal parts, grind them and place them in a new pot with a small hole in the bottom, enough to fit a drop.	Now this is the description of the caustic; I have already put it in my treatise on the improvement of drugs: take of the salt of potash and quicklime, equal parts, and beat them both up well and put them into a new earthen pot, in the bottom of which you have made a small hole of a size to take a probe.	0.7092414
Place an enameled pot beneath the first, and pour fresh water over the alkali and lime to cover them by a finger's width, then press firmly with your hand, and let the water drip through the hole into the enameled pot below.	Place under that pot another one, glazed. Pour enough water on the quicklime and potash to cover them to a finger's breadth after you have pressed them well together with your hand; and leave the pot until the caustic fluid has passed down into the bottom of the glazed pot. Then collect all that fluid and pour it upon a fresh lot of lime and potash.	0.7356428
Collect this water, pour it over more fresh lime and alkali, making it very strong, useful in many medical operations and in cauterizing other body parts, as it acts like fire.	Then collect all that fluid and pour it upon a fresh lot of lime and potash. Thus will the water be very caustic indeed. This is used for many medical procedures and for the cauterization of all members, as it has the very same action as fire itself.	0.7429681
This is one of the medicines used for hip cauterization, such as vinegar and honey mixed with lime and soap.	There are other drugs too with which the capsule of the femur is cauterized, such as Thapsia and Mel Anacardinum and inunction of lime with soap.	0.5683528
Gualia recounts an ancient remedy and cure for hip and sciatic vein pain, highly praising it, saying it requires no other treatment, and that it heals in one application as he described, quickly entering the bath and emerging cured.	Galen, quoting one of the men of old, mentions a treatment for pain in the thigh and sciatica and he makes much of it, asserting that no other treatment was necessary, and that it would heal on one application, so much so that the patient would be carried into the bath and would go out completely cured.	0.75784546
Take fresh rue, or if unavailable, fresh figs; crush them well with a bit of fat and place on the painful hip, thigh, or leg, and bind it.	The method is as follows: take fresh green water-cress or new dry water-cress if fresh is not to be had; beat it up well with some fat and apply it to the hip where it hurts, or to the leg or thigh, and bind up.	0.7205376
Leave it for three hours or until the patient feels relief from the burning.	Then let be for three hours or until the patient feels a diminishing of the caustic; and then let him be taken to the bath.	0.7546034
Then bathe the patient, and when the body is warm, expose it to the sun, as the pain will cease and healing will occur.	When his body is bedewed with sweat, get him into the pool; then the pain will vanish and he will be cured.	0.6197923
Be aware that cauterization with these medicines should only be used after body evacuation.	But you must know that no one should have cauterization with these drugs except after evacuation of the bowel.	0.75265634
However, Escorides said that cauterizing the sciatic vein with goat fat is beneficial; do this by soaking wool in old oil, placing it between the foot's bones and the ankle.	Dioscorides has said that cauterization with goats' dung is beneficial for sciatica. The cauterization is carried out in this manner: take wool soaked in old oil and put it into the cleft which is between the thumb and the forearm but nearer to the forearm.	0.75106466
Then take dry goat fat, burn it to charcoal, place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.	Then take the dried dung of a goat and expose it to fire until it glows like a coal.	0.73311067
Repeat this process until the biting sensation reaches the hip, alleviating the pain.	Place it on the piece of wool, and leave till it cools, then replace it with another, and so on until the sensation has reached the hip joint by way of the forearm, and the pain stops.	0.46890712
This method of cauterization is called cow cautery.	This kind of cautery is called 'the dung cautery'.	0.68421656
