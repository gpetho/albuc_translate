On extracting the frog generated under the tongue.
A swelling resembling a small frog may occur under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and it may grow until it fills the mouth. The procedure for this is to open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the swelling.
If you see it dull-colored or black, hard, and the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is cancer.  But if it is whitish and moist, insert a hook into it and incise it with a delicate scalpel, and free it from every side.
If the blood overcomes you during the procedure, apply powdered vitriol to it until the bleeding stops, then return to the procedure until you extract it completely.  Then gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with all appropriate treatment until it heals.
