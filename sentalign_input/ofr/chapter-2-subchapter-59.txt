of bladder diseases
When excoriations or blood appear in the bladder, or pus has collected there, and you want to instill waters and medicines, then make the instrument that is called "clepsydra", and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three holes:
Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the nozzle end through which the medicine flows should be such that it fits tightly into the penis without anything added, so that one can draw out the moisture, and inject when necessary;
and when you want to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the end of the catheter in the liquid, and draw on the suction device that is inside;
thus you will draw the moisture into the catheter, and then push the suction device back in firmly;
so the liquid will enter and go directly to the bladder, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the thin clyster with which one irrigates the bladder:
so it is here:
And it is made of silver or brass, and the head is higher up;
and underneath has a cavity where the liquid falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you want to irrigate the bladder, then tie it firmly between the two cavities with a good double thread, and warm this liquid a little over the fire;
then insert the tip of the clyster into the penis, then squeeze your hand on the bladder evenly with the liquid, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder;
and if you don't have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around; 
then thread a strong string through these holes, then gather the circle as one gathers a bag, and put inside what you want of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, squeezing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
