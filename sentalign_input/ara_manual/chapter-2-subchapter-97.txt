Chapter Ninety-Seven
On Applying Leeches
Leeches are only used in most cases on organs where cupping glasses cannot be placed, either because of their small size, such as the lip and gums and the like, or because the organ is devoid of flesh, such as the finger, nose and the like.
The way to use them is to select leeches that are in fresh, pure water free from impurities, then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry and there is nothing left in their bellies.
Then the body is first evacuated by phlebotomy or cupping, then the diseased organ is wiped.
Until it reddens, then it is placed on it, and when it is full it falls off.  If it is possible to suck the area with a cupping glass, it is more effective in benefit, otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage it and squeeze it.  If the flow of blood continues after the leech falls off and it is oozing, then soak a linen cloth in cold water.
And place it on top until the oozing stops. If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle on it powdered vitriol or gallnut or similar astringents until the bleeding stops, or place peeled halves of fava beans on the area.
And leave it until the fava beans stick to the area, then the bleeding will stop. And if there is a need to reapply leeches, do not reapply those leeches if others are available. If the leeches refuse to attach, then wipe the area with fresh blood.
Or prick the area with a needle until some blood comes out, then place them; for when they sense some blood they will stick to the spot. When you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them some aloe, salt, or ash, and they will immediately fall off.
