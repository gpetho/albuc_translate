On the method of cauterizing pustules or boils known as Albathir.
Chapter 57.
Sometimes foul pustules, known as Albathir, appear on the body, caused by corrupted, thick humors.
It is necessary, when they first appear, to cauterize the top of each pustule with a fine cautery, such as a myrtle twig with a fire-heated tip.
Alternatively, use the root of long Aristolochia (birthwort).
Or, you may use a lenticular-shaped cautery.
Sometimes, early cauterization of these pustules, following this method, prevents them from enlarging, breaks up the excess humor causing them, and brings about healing.
However, this procedure should be carried out after purging through bloodletting.
