On the reduction of dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.	On the reduction of a dislocation of the clavicle and of the head of the humerus.	0.8680265
The collarbone is not dislocated inward due to its connection with the chest; but sometimes it is dislocated outward, and this is felt by touch.	The clavicle is never dislocated inwards because of its continuity with the breast-bone; but sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and then it is detected by palpation.	0.8486732
The reduction is done by having the patient lie on their back and extend their arms. Then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return to place.	The replacement is thus: the patient is to lie on his back and stretch out both arms; then with the palm of your hand press heavily upon the place and it will go back.	0.8423753
Then apply a plaster and powder to the area and bind it tightly.	Then apply to it the plaster and pads, and bandage it up.	0.74061006
But the extremity that follows the elbow and is connected to it is not easily dislocated; when it is, it must be reduced and aligned as previously described and according to the method prepared.	As to the extremity of the clavicle, which is close to the shoulder and joined to it, it is only rarely dislocated; but if ever it is dislocated you must reduce it and set it straight as we have mentioned, by any convenient means.	0.7321117
Then apply a plaster, powder, and binding, and instruct the patient to remain tranquil and at rest until it is healed.	Then apply the plaster, pads, and bandages, and bid the patient keep quiet and still until it is healed.	0.93256617
And the same treatment is applied to the muscle extremity when it is separated from its place.	By this same treatment you may also reduce the head of the humerus when it is displaced.	0.54030037
