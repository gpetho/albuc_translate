On the method of cauterizing in cases of paralysis and muscle relaxation.
Chapter X.
It is necessary to proceed with cleansing the head using hyeeras and according to the previously described methods.
Then shave the patientâ€™s head; afterward, apply a cautery in the middle of the head, a cautery on each corner of the head, one on the back, and three on the vertebrae of the neck.
If the ailment requires more extensive muscle relaxation and the patient can tolerate it, and the ailment is severe, then apply four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, with the last cautery burning deep into the skin until much of it is seared, then lift your hand.
Then treat him until he is healed, using the olive-shaped cautery in this manner.
