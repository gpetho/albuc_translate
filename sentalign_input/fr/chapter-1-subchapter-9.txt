of the coldness of the head
It is necessary that the head be cleansed with purgatives and what we have mentioned before; afterward shave the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each corner, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck; and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is enduring, and the disease is strong, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until most of the core is burned, then lift your hand; afterward treat until healed, and use the cautery called "olivare" that we have mentioned before.
