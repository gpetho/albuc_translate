Oh, children of learning, I have finished this book for you, which is the culmination of the science of medicine, by the grace of God, and by the encouragement of my students, and by the proofs of my experience, it is clear to me that I must explain this treatise to you, which is part of my art, so to speak, surgery.
For our region and our time, surgery is a dangerous and private art, for it is fraught with peril to the science itself; and the vision of it is almost extinct; and it remains only with some few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which change almost everything and even makes worse the errors and doubts that exist until it is understood that the true essence of the art lies in the knowledge and the power of the same.
I know that I have followed this treatise in the order of exposition and declaration, and by abbreviation; and that it is necessary to add to the declaration the forms of the cautery instruments and other instruments of the work, as well as the preparation of them, which is necessary.
The great reason why no wise man in our time finds good art in surgery, is that the art of medicine is long, and that it requires a learned actor who has been exercised in the science of anatomy, knowing the structure of the limbs and their shapes, and the joints and their separation; and the knowledge of bones, nerves, and vessels, and their number, and their color; and the pulse of the veins and the quiet of the arteries, and the seat of the disease.
And thus Hippocrates said that he who has no name is nothing, more so in small works, and most of all in the art of the hand.
As I have already said at the beginning of this book; he seen many die from the errors of those who are not learned in anatomy, and who fall into error because of their lack of knowledge in this science and their experiments
For example, I saw a foolish and inept physician who performed an incision on the groin of a woman, and who cut several arteries in the groin so that a great quantity of blood flowed out, and the woman died between her thighs.
I also saw another physician who took hold of a stone that had been in a man’s belly for a long time, and the stone was large, and he brought it out with a piece of the gut, and the man died on the third day.
I have already mentioned this, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die
And I saw another physician who was taking care of a duke from our land for surgery, and he gave him a black slave who had a fractured thigh bone; and in his ignorance, the physician extracted the fracture from the socket, with sponges and bandages, with great force, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Then he left according to his desires, and he bound him, and he left him for several days and commanded that he be left alone; and thus the thighbone perished.
I went to see him and I found that he had loosened the bandage, and peace and quiet had returned and the pain had vanished
However, the corruption had already spread throughout the limb, for it was unable to contain it, and it continued to spread throughout the limb until the disease itself became imminent.
I also saw another physician who performed an incision on a cancerous tumor, and he opened it up several days later, and he found that the tumor had increased in size, and that the disease had spread throughout the body
The cause of this is that cancer is pure melancholy humor, and it does not suffice to remove it from the body, but that it must be removed from the limb in which it has settled, because it is the host of all the other humors in the body
Therefore, children, you must know that the art of surgery is divided into two parts: the one that is associated with health, and the one that is dangerous in the greatest precautions
And I have already spoken of this throughout this book concerning the operations in which there is error and fear; for you must guard against these and leave those who are foolish to their own devices, so that they do not find fault with you or bring you into disrepute
Therefore take the sacred arms in request for God's help, and the sacred sick in exhortation and encouragement.
Therefore use the best way through God's grace to achieve salvation and blessed posterity, and lay aside the deadly diseases of difficult healing, and remain with the sacred arms of those who inspire fear, so that your satisfaction in your faith and your trust in his name does not vanish: for may there remain to your glory, and more in heaven and beyond the saints.</end_of_turn>
Indeed, I have already said in several places: “There is no medicine for a bad disease, so that no doctors should be called by that name.”</start_of_turn>
And I have already finished this book according to three chapters.</start_of_turn>
Begin the division of the book, and first of the first part.</start_of_turn> The first chapter ordered from the head downwards, concerning the forms of instruments and the utensils of cautery, and what is necessary for the operation.</start_of_turn
The division of the second part.</start_of_turn The second chapter, concerning swelling and perforation, and wounds, ulcers, and the extraction of arrows, all categorized and ordered according to the forms of instruments.</start_of_turn
The third chapter, concerning restoration and dislocation, and care of fractures and similar cases; categorized from the head downwards, and according to the forms of instruments.</start_of_turn
That I have said what is the quality of the instruments of that cautery and the documents of them, and in what combination it is prohibited to cauterize.</start_of_turn
Therefore I say that the speech about the quality of the instruments of that cautery and their documents is a long and profound speech, subtle for science, and a secret hidden; and that many great scholars have spoken of it, and they have disagreed with each other, and I am content with a small part of their speeches, fearing the length of the discourse.</start_of_turn
Therefore I say that cautery conforms to all universal completion except for two completions, which are caudal completions of its matter.</start_of_turn
In the caudal and dry completion of the matter, discordance appears; for some say that cautery is useful for that, and others say that it is harmful for that, because the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that the disease be both caudal and dry at the same time.</start_of_turn
And some say that for cautery is useful in every caudal and dry disease that appears in the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of a man with the humidity of the air to the completion of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
And I say concerning this speech that I have already experienced in some way.
May be, however, that I have not yet spoken of that which has already been exposed and exercised in the chapter of cautery after practice, and to know the diversity of the temperaments of men and the disposition of diseases in their bodies, and the causes of these, and their accidents, and the space of time of these.</start_of_turn
May be in other completions, you are not afraid, and more so in cold and wet diseases, for already all doctors agree on that, and they do not disagree in the use of cautery in those.</start_of_turn
And you know, children, that the secret of the care of cautery with fire and the goodness of it, is about cautery with burning medicine, for the fire is simple, the action of which reaches only the member which is cauterized and does not touch the other member adjacent to it except for a small document.</start_of_turn
For the action of burning medicine reaches only that in the members from which it is removed, and it makes it come out in the diseased member of difficult healing very strong.</start_of_turn
For the fire, for its subtlety and its preciousness, does nothing but what we already know by experience and by the length of our service in studying the art concerning the truth of the causes; and for this reason I am excused for the length of this speech, for it is not fitting for me to speak of such a secret in this place to you.
The time is right, children, for you to desist from cautery and rest for the best part of the day.
I say that cautery is convenient at all times, so that it does not suffer for the sudden occurrence of pain, for it is immersed in the support of water which is applied to the cautery and which is more so if the cautery is for pains or necessary pains, which are strong and painful, for they do not suffer from delay so that it is feared that those which come later will be malicious, which is greater than a slight neglect of the time.</end_of_turn>
I do not know of other treatments, or children, except for the common people and fools among the doctors, so that at that disease which is healed by cautery it is not a shame at all times, and rest is sufficient.</end_of_turn>
And the cause is not that they give it because of water, for cautery is nothing but a medicine which alters the composition and dries the humors which are the cause of pain.</end_of_turn
But indeed cautery often surpasses medicine by its pleasure and worth and greatness of the Lord.</end_of_turn>
It is possible that your disease will return at some time of the day, according to the composition of the disease and the location of the disease, and the virtue of them, and what is prepared in the body from the accumulation of superfluities in it, and what is obtained from it in its acquisition in food and other things; but if the disease in which cautery is administered is a subtle disease in a member of few superfluities and humors, like for example cautery of the tooth for pain and the like, it is possible that in it the said pain will not return, even though it is done in small quantities.</end_of_turn
And indeed the vulgar saying is that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and is a treacherous saying, not for those who understand it, for they believe that it is not a cure that takes advantage of medicine or any other cause except for cautery itself.</end_of_turn
And the cause is on the contrary; and the understanding that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is true only when the methods of treatment of certain diseases are administered, and those medicines do not benefit, and in the end when the cause is administered one has cautery, and takes advantage of that.</end_of_turn And indeed from here it can be said that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the understanding which the vulgar people and the fools of the doctors have.</end_of_turn
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and I do not say anything except for the equality of gold and the fineness of its substance.</end_of_turn
And I say that the location of the cautery does not make it worse, as it is not absolutely true, for I have already seen that it does not do anything except in some rare cases, and that cautery with gold is better than with iron indeed as they say; but indeed when you make cautery with fire from gold, it is not your business, for it is ignited according to the quantity you wish for the roughness of the gold, and it prepares to receive heat; and if you adjust it too much it will consume the gold by the fire, and if you take off some of the gold there will remain only some scales because the artisan cuts for the occupation of that.</end_of_turn
And for this reason it is useful to make cautery with iron that you put on more lightly and more cautiously to the rectification of the operation.</end_of_turn
I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those which are between the feet to be omitted, so that I avoid demanding what you wish from me.</end_of_turn
The first chapter.</end_of_turn>
This cautery confers to the humidity and frigidity about the accidental cause of which it is said to be the cause of soda and multiple fluxes of the rheumatic kind, applied to the head to the parts of the limbs and the nails, and multiple sleep, and toothache and swelling, and universally of any disease that comes from frigidity, even as paralysis, sopor and apoplexy, and the like.</end_of_turn
The way of this cautery is this, that first of all it commands the patient to evacuate with medical laxatives the head for three or four nights, according to the excess of the virtue of the disease and the age of the patient and his custom.</end_of_turn
And it commands him to remove the hair from the head with a razor, and to make him sit on a fallen bench and place his hands on his feet.</end_of_turn
And place your thumb close to the base of the nose between the eyebrows. Moreover, when the physician confirms that the affected area is the knee, he should grasp it with his thumb and index finger, and with the cautery he should burn the olive oil of which this is the form:
And place it over the area that is being cauterized with the thumb, so that it descends, with your hand being slightly constrained, and you will rotate that.
Then withdraw your hand slightly and support the area, and if you see that some quantity of the bone is already exposed, as much as the quantity of barley grains, then raise your hand again, and if you do not turn your hand away from the instrument, do so from the other side, while it is still cold, until it is seen from the bone as I have said to you
And take a little salt and dissolve it on the area and keep it there for three days.
And place a bandage around the area bordering on the edge and keep it on until the burn mark of the fire is destroyed And take care of the area with the usual medicines until it is healed
And indeed, when the disease remains open, then a brace should be taken so that it is better and more healing
I say to you all that the bone must be cauterized until the bone itself, and that the cautery must be held in place until all parts of the substance of the bone are consumed.
And thus be the matter of the bone that is tough, and be cured.
And I say that it should be cauterized until the marrow is reached, because it strengthens the bone more when it is fractured than when it is whole, and this is the way of allaying the pain of the small bones: And it is estimated that the vapors of the head escape from that area.
And if the disease remains open for a long time, and finally be cured when it has solidified
I do not see these two methods of cautery in many people, except in fools out of fear; and leave it to you, it is better for your health, when it is possible, that the head should be developed by the continuation of its functions as we have testified in other members, and more so when the head of the disease is of a cold nature
The first method is better and more beneficial for me; and from this one and from that work I have seen that it is healthier.

The end of the text is missing from the provided context.
When in all the head there is chronic and lasting pain and that which is in the disease is prolonged, and you use herbs, poultices, cataplasms, plasters, mustard seeds, barley, millet, and other similar things, and especially if it has already been cauterized with a cautery that accounts for it and does not benefit from them in any of those causes, then consider that if the head of the disease is of strong formation in its nature; and it is not cold and finds little heat, then you should cauterize with another cautery, leaving a little space between them. And cauterize that over the heel of the foot with the cautery until the marrow is fractured Fracture the bone and uncover from the bone the quantity that we have mentioned, and cauterize that with a cautery in the posterior part of the head in the area where wind is stopped. And rest your hand on it like this, and do not uncover the bone, for the disease finds great pain from that other than from the pain of all the other cauteries of the head
I say that this cautery in this place is better than the cautery with which the nails of the head and the occipital bone are cauterized, for it is more subtle; and this is the way of doing it.
End of text.
Of ancient emigration cauteries.
When in the part of the head there is sudden pain, or is prolonged pain in the heel, evacuate with medicines the head somewhat loosened, and administer the other care that I have mentioned in the preceding diseases; and all this without benefit, for the cautery in these cases is done in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with an instrument
Better is the cautery with burning medicine than that with which you take a piece of aloe and burn its exterior and remove the extremities of both heads And immediately prick the area of pain in the temple with a lancet as far as it penetrates the flesh without leaving the corden exposed, as it is hidden.
And hold over the area for a while to prevent constriction, and leave it for three hours; then remove the ligature and take hold of the pulse, and leave the bandage for two or three days, and rest over the area immersed in broth until the area feels better
And care for the area until it is healed.
And if you wish, I can write to you about other medicines that combat these which I have written about in the treatise on combatting medicines
May the cautery be performed according to this manner: fire for cautery of which this is the form:
and it is called closed nails, where the head is like a nail with a curvature in which there is a small elevation in the middle of the area
And rest over the area of pain, and hold your hand—so that the surrounding area is not scorched by the cautery—and move the fire slowly over the area.
And if the quantity of blood scorched by the corden is great in relation to the total, elevate your hand so that the artery is not scorched, which would prevent the flow of blood
And soak the area in salt water and rest it over the area, leaving it for three days; then rest the area covered with a bandage, and care for the area until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize at the extremity of the cuticle according to the cautery, and keep the incision from the artery in this part, which is not an old wound.
Chapter four.</start_of_turn>
Of cautery of ancient wound
When you have cured the ancient wound as we have said of the preceding care, and as we have said in the division of diseases, and you do not benefit from the care, sometimes for the disease does not reach the amount we have said of the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire, then leave the fire of the cautery on the cuticle until it is whitened, because it signifies over the area of pain along the length of which is the greatest part of the digit, or whatever; and remove your hand for a while and hold it over the wound while you are incuding the artery and until you reach the bone
However, it is necessary for you to take care of the continuity of the mandible, which is unfortunate because of chewing, and that the nerves are not scorched and that no spasm occurs.
And if it is about the custody and care of the flow of blood of the artery that is being lanced, because in the lancing there is fear, and especially for that one who ignores what he does and is reckless; leave the operation in his hands from the beginning
And I come to remind you of the regiment of the flow of blood in the accident of the artery according to their manner, in the place of this book.
And if you see this disease that does not benefit from this cautery and see that the patient can tolerate the pain, cauterize that in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and care for the wound until it is healed
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on stretching of the artery with two nails, which is better cautery and more comfortable
Chapter five.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of the pains of the heel bones
When in the heel there is pain from cold and is cured by lacative causes and by the other care that I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then leave the fire of the cautery, which is called puncture, of which this is the form:
And immediately prick close to the ignition, and be careful around the entire heel as if rolling, or in the circumference of any abscess if the pain is in any part Along with you I cauterize from the root of the heel slowly rather than abruptly because you can see the area better
And if you have cauterized ten times in the whole heel, and what is that? And care for the area until it is healed
Chapter six.</start_of_turn
From cautery of turmeric.
Turmeric, which is cured by cautery, is nothing other than the spices which cause inflammation, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.</end_of_turn>
Avoid cautery of the spice which must be dried or cause spasm of the nerves.</end_of_turn>
When you have cured that spice of turmeric, and you have plastered it and anointed it, and you have applied compresses, do not eat your cure until you have cauterized the patient three times: the first to remove the hair, the second a little bit lower down, and the third to join the two lips together.</end_of_turn
And rest the cautery for the opposite of the painful part, because moisture does not suffice except in the part that appears to be healed.</end_of_turn
And the way of cautery is that you cauterize that which is at the root of the limb plus slightly above the nail of the toe, and in the temple another, the length of which should be according to the length of the finger without going beyond. Stop your hand with the cautery until the quantity of the matter of the spice of turmeric has been consumed.</end_of_turn
This is the way of cautery, and it is the spice of the surgeon, the form of which is like a sawtooth.</end_of_turn More importantly, that a little goes a long way; and cover with them instead of excessive thickness a little.</end_of_turn
And finally cure the area with that which is denant proceeds until it is healed.</end_of_turn
The end.</start_of_turn>
From cautery of ancient apoplexy.</start_of_turn>
When the apoplexia is ancient and you have cured that which we have said, and you do not fear your medicine and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize that which is four times: on all the nails of the foot; at the root and the middle of the toe, as we have said; and on the heel.</end_of_turn The way of cautery is sufficient as it is said.</start_of_turn
And it is already cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is more behind; and like that it should be cured with that which proceeds.</start_of_turn
The end.</start_of_turn
From cautery for forgotten pain caused by inflammation.</start_of_turn
Cover that the patient is given at the beginning large herbs and pills that serve to mitigate them.</start_of_turn
And like that cover the head of the patient completely and stop the bleeding of them by covering them with the plaster described in the treatise on plastering.</start_of_turn
And stop any herbs, for that is the way of cautery.</start_of_turn And do it like that which has already been said.</start_of_turn
And thus if for these healthy people it is good; and if not, then do three cauteries on the back of the foot, which are dependent on the part most above the head within the part furthest from the heel.</start_of_turn And stop between each cautery the thickness of the finger, and like that cure the cautery with that which proceeds.</start_of_turn
More if you wish to become addicted and the patient is able, then do the cautery at the middle of the toe; and if you wish greater addiction, then cauterize that which is over the two nails.</start_of_turn
Like that cure when it is healed; and let the cautery olive oil according to the manner described before.</start_of_turn
The end.</start_of_turn
From cautery of carbuncles and mollification of all the body.</start_of_turn
Cover that you process in mitigation of the head with herbs and with that which has been said; and like that cover the head of the patient, and like that cauterize that which is at the middle of the toe, and that which is over all the nails of the foot, and that which is over the back of them, and three cauteries over the vertebrae of the heel.</start_of_turn
And if it is necessary in the disease of mitigation of the body of the limbs that the patient is able and the disease is strong, then cauterize that which is four times over the vertebrae of the buttocks, and afterwards like that cover until it is consumed by the turmeric, and remove your hand.</start_of_turn And thus care for the one who is well, and this one is cautery oil.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
These sentences deal with the treatment of gout, a painful inflammatory condition affecting the joints caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints. The physician recommends the use of cautery oil as part of the treatment.
The cautery is not performed directly on the inflamed area but on the area affected by the inflammation.
Therefore modify the head of the patient at the beginning and at the end of the treatment, and the other care that we have indicated in the division when the patient is great and tolerates the exception of the medicines
And if it is a child who does not suffer from the medicines, then give astringents and bitter substances to serve as modification, giving this for several days, to the benefit of the food
Then remove the head of the patient, and then cauterize that which is like a cautery in the middle of the head according to the manner mentioned before, and on another side of the head do the same. And if the patient is strong and tolerates it, then cauterize that which we have said, having paralyzed and softened the body over the vertebrae of the thigh and the vertebrae of the loin
And thus care for the one who is well, and this one is cautery oil as before
Even if the patient is a child, pause the cautery cautiously according to this manner.
These sentences deal with the treatment of gout, a painful inflammatory condition affecting the joints caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints. The physician recommends the use of cautery oil as part of the treatment.
These sentences deal with the treatment of melancholy, a mental state characterized by persistent low mood, loss of interest, and difficulty concentrating
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and great inflammation, then cauterize that which we have said is to be cauterized, having paralyzed it
And if the cause of melancholy is excessive superfluidity declining to melancholy, and the patient's body is humous, then give him to drink that which modifies the head of the patient as we have said before
Then remove the head of the patient, and then make a proper incision downwards to the circle, and remove that which is in the middle of the head
And the patient should be placed in a state of collapse and held entirely still
And pause the liniment; and it is more advisable to bind against sheep. And burn that over the fire for moderate heat for measure, which will give relief when it is put on the patient And then pour oil into the middle of the head in the circle, and keep it within until it is warmed up
And give the patient water every day for a week, with the other remedies of the good things which are to be kept within until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize that which makes small points according to the best of your ability, but keep your hand over the area with a cautery in order, this is a kind of cautery which moistens the head with equality
And pause that corner inwards in border or in gray of grease
These sentences deal with the treatment of epilepsy, a neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures
Of the cautery of water descending into the nose.
When it is reported to you that water has descended into the nose for the symptoms mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink water that which modifies the head of the patient, and keep him away from all humors
And make him vomit in water for four days
And command him to keep his head bowed, and cauterize that which is like a cautery in the middle of the head; and cauterize twice on two temples if this is the beginning of the vomiting of water in two nostrils, or once if it is the beginning of the vomiting of water in one nostril
Burn all the veins and arteries which are left of the cord; and let the cauteries be on that length in the breadth of the temples
And keep him away from fluxes of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see fluxes of blood, stop any medicine that is in your power
And I say that I know the wisdom which is in the extraction of arrows and in the abstinence from those and the care for the flux of blood.
Each vein is cauterized at the junction of two bones with two cautery instruments which are produced in this way
Chapter XIII.</end_of_turn>
Of the cauterization of ancient tears.</end_of_turn>
When tears from the eyes are ancient and adhere to the veins and arteries which are in the external part of the head and it is verified that these are superfluous fatuous phlegmas, then cauterize that which we have recounted in the chapter concerning the beginning of water in the belly of the uterus, and that in the middle of the head and two cauteries at the junction of two temples, and two cauteries at the junction of two bones.</end_of_turn> And if the digestion is insufficient, then cauterize that which is in all the area of the heel on the edge of the heel with a small cautery.</end_of_turn
Chapter XIV.</end_of_turn
Of the cauterization of the stench of the nose.</end_of_turn
When your physician has said that which we have said in the division and does not profit from your medicine, then you must approach him and give him to drink for three nights the broth of the patient; and approach his head and cauterize that which is between the middle and the olive.</end_of_turn And approach cauterizes that which is between the claw and two cauteries over the two heels so that the hair is cut off a little.</end_of_turn
And take care that the arrow does not burn that.</end_of_turn
And concerning the cautery of the claw, this is its form.</end_of_turn
Chapter XV.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of the softening of the eyelids of the eyes.</end_of_turn
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by disease or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery with this crescent; and this is its form:</end_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize over the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries throughout, and let them lengthen from the temples.</end_of_turn And let the length of each cautery be according to the amount of the eyebrow.</end_of_turn
And do not press too much your hand with the cautery, but according to the amount that the third part of the eyelid is adhered.</end_of_turn
Chapter XVI.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of the eye when the eyelashes have become converted to the parts downwards and put your hand on the eye.</end_of_turn
When the eyelashes of the eye are converted to the downwards parts and put your hand on the eye, cauterize in those two ways, that is to say with a burn or with medicine that burns.</end_of_turn
If you burn them with fire, command the patient to drink giving him to drink those things which make the eyelashes lengthen, such as vinegar, until they are prolonged and equal; and if you put them in, strengthen the eyes of the patient with a bandage so that it is not painful until the eyelashes are born.</end_of_turn
Therefore when they are born and equal, command the patient to rest his head on the belly and approach over the eye of the patient with your hand, and touch, with a signal which is like the figure of a dead leaf, and let the beginning of the signal be near the eyelashes.</end_of_turn
And approach keep the eye covered in ointment of gum or in plaster over the eye.</end_of_turn
And approach is the cautery of which this is the form.</end_of_turn
And approach cauterize over the figure which you have signed, little by little, in small veins, until the surface of the cord which is like a dead leaf is consumed, all in appearance properly.</end_of_turn
And the sign of the completion of the work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already being contracted and the eyelashes of the eye already being raised beyond the puncture of the eye.</end_of_turn
And therefore raise your hand and leave it for three days, and approach keep over it the eye with a border until the scar is healed.</end_of_turn Then attend to that which is burning within until it is healed.
Then if it returns for any cause, promptly administer nourishment and soften the pulse, for the hour will provide another opportunity to apply the cautery over the whole area as was done previously.</end_of_turn>
Then if the pain is in the pulse, leave it alone, elevate the limb naturally to its rightful place, and let the swelling subside, for the pain will disappear.</end_of_turn
Then apply medicine to burn away what causes the patient to groan, for it commands the patient to rest their limbs until they are prolonged and softened, and promptly provide support with a linen bandage in the shape of a feather of mercury.</end_of_turn
And promptly take from the patient a draught of wine and vinegar.</end_of_turn> namely.</end_of_turn> or what is in it, and mix these three causes together, make fasting for it so that it is not chilled; and immediately expand from this over the bandage which is applied thus in the form of a feather of mercury, and place that over the heel or over both; and keep the heel of the patient in the groin against the hub of the thigh bone.</end_of_turn
And keep saying about the medicine and do not move until the patient feels the warmth of the medicine, which is in them thus as from fire.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you perceive that the other pain has ceased, the hour reads the medicine and does not move until the patient says; when the pain has ceased, the hour remains with the medicine and washes the pulse with water; and the hour considers whether the pulse is already lifted thus as from the constriction caused by the fire or incision, for the hour knows that this is good; and if it does not return concerning the medicine over the limb where it was not pressed, and until the operation is healed and the pain has subsided.</end_of_turn>
Then keep the limb covered with a border until the swelling of the wound has disappeared, and then attend to that which is burning within until it is healed.</end_of_turn
It is necessary for you to know that you must keep the wound covered with the dressing until the swelling of the wound has disappeared, and if the pulse is softened on the other days, every cause of pain which causes the patient to press on the pulse, the hour repeats the medicine over that limb which was softened, just as you did at the beginning, and immediately take it away when it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of cautery of fistula which is in the lacrimal bone of the limb.</end_of_turn
When you cure the fistula with what has been said in the divisions of the diseases and you do not confide your cure, the hour covers that you cauterize thus: command the patient to place their head on their thigh, and keep the head of them from any attendant between the thighs in such a way that it is not too tight or agitated on the head of the thigh bone.</end_of_turn
And immediately place the limb immersed in water or in mucus on the limb.</end_of_turn
And immediately apply the cautery of which this is the shape:
which is convex, thus as in the shape of a cane or of the head of a nail, to the limb where it is useful.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, penetrate through to the other limb.</end_of_turn And if you wish, go out thus as you came.</end_of_turn
But the one that is convex is better for the work.</end_of_turn
And immediately close the fistula if it is open, and bring them back to health, and dry that.</end_of_turn And if it is not open, the hour opens that and removes the pus from it.</end_of_turn
And immediately keep the cautery lit, and give them a little of the cautery of the pulse at the root of the nose, so that you do not burn your hand or make the patient restless, and the hour pauses the cautery on the gray matter of the limb and relieves that.</end>
Therefore, if the cautery enters the bone at the beginning of the procedure, it is not good; otherwise, repeat the cautery once or twice if necessary. Leave that area untouched for three days, and then place your hand over the area around the bone and send it back into the socket until it is healed.
Even if they have passed a few days and it is not healed, then pause the aggressive corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and is as it should be according to your custom
Another method of cautery for fistula is as follows: enter the fistula at the site of the fissure and clamp that. Then pause in that soft area of the wound which is the cause of the fistula. When you have done that, take note of the quantity of blood that has bled; keep your hand firmly over the wound to prevent further bleeding, and do not worry about the pain of the patient because the blood will adhere to the bottom of the fistula and will heal without any miracle.</end_of_turn>
If the fistula is healed with the cautery and care mentioned above, it is not good; otherwise, it is necessary to administer treatment from the nose and reduce the fistula to its natural location.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XVIII.</end_of_turn>
Of cautery of the wound let us speak.</end_of_turn
Many times excessive force is used to cauterize fissures in the lips, especially in the lips of children.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you treat those fissures as we have said in the sections and do not take advantage of your care, then you must burn the little ulcer with the following method:
And the curvature of the wound according to the softness of the tissue.</end_of_turn
Then pause for a moment at the beginning of the incision until the cautery reaches the base of the wound.</end_of_turn
And take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of cautery of fistula in the mouth.</end_of_turn
When there is a swelling of the uvula or the palate or the roots of the teeth due to pus and it breaks and becomes infected, and there is a fistula, and you do not take advantage of the treatment, then you must burn the fistula according to the quantity that is received in the fistula. And put that fire in the mouth of the fistula, and keep your hand over it until the fire reaches its base, and after that do it slowly a little more; and take care of that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if the abscess is healed and is healed, it is not good; otherwise, it is necessary to uncover the location and remove the corrupted bone as it is written in the chapter.</end_of_turn

Of cautery of the teeth and of softening of the arteries.</end_of_turn
When the arteries are softened by humidity and the teeth are blackened, and you treat them with medicines and do not confer relief, then you must place the patient’s hand on the abdomen and burn the area of the wound with the following method. While you are doing this, keep your hand firmly over the tooth so that the fire does not burn the surrounding tissue.
And take your hand away and repeat the cautery several times as you wish.</end_of_turn
And then let the patient rinse their mouth with salt water and keep it there for an hour, and then remove it, for the blackened tooth is stopped and the softened gum is strengthened and the corrupted moisture is dried out.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXI.</end_of_turn
Of cautery for toothache.</end_of_turn
When toothache is due to cold, or when it is cold or hot, or does not relieve with treatment with medicine, then there are two methods of cautery: either burn around the root of the tooth or burn with fire.</end_of_turn
Burning around the root is to take the border of cows and put it in a crucible of iron, and then take hold of the tooth and encircle it with that, and burn that around the painful tooth festinantly until it is numb.</end_of_turn
Then repeat the above-mentioned herbs until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
If you wish, immerse wool or cloth in the border of the said tooth, and place it over the painful tooth, and place over that an ignited iron until the iron reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.</end_of_turn>
More importantly, the cautery with fire is that you take care of the quality of the wood or iron, and that in the body of it any blackness or the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.</end_of_turn>
And repeat the igniting of the cautery in the form in which it comes, and place it over the tooth and hold your hand over it until the cautery is cool; and do some herbs so that the pain may subside today or tomorrow or the next day.</end_of_turn
And know that for the mastery of this cautery that the patient must fill his mouth with good broth and keep it there for an hour, and then draw out; and this is the way of the cautery.</end_of_turn>
And cauterize as much as you wish of the extremities according to what is possible for you.</end_of_turn>

And if the abscess is small, then pause the cautery according to the quantity of the abscess, and keep it covered for three days and place over it a cloth soaked in broth until it is digested what the fire has consumed.</end_of_turn

And know that you must not bring the cautery to the epiglottis nor burn the thyroid but only a little.</end_of_turn
And cauterize that which is beyond another cautery must be at the junction of the collarbone with the last vertebra of the neck.</end_of_turn And the cautery of the neck is like the previous one.</end_of_turn

And if you wish, make your cautery puncture like the one that is called puncture, the form of which is described in the puncture of heel pain.</end_of_turn
And so do punctures among cats as well; and take care of that which is before until it is healed.</end_of_turn

When the cap of the assistant is displaced due to slippery humidity and is not fixed at the time of the convalescence, you must return the displacement to him as soon as it is customary for him to return it, and immediately, as we have testified, the covering must be reduced first of all, and then the patient must be reversed over the seat or over the side; and finally raise the knee which is on the side of the assistant’s left hand if the joint is displaced at the side of the knee.
And immediately ignite the cautery without two heads; this is the way to do it:
And immediately cauterize the knee until it penetrates the other side; and the mark of the cautery will come out when there are four cauteries.
Each hair is adjusted according to this count and because there are eight cauteries
Then pause over the cautery with salt, and immediately cause adhesion of the patient to tranquility, and the limb must not be painful for any time until it is comforted
And if the displacement is on the upper parts and it is necessary, then immediately cauterize over the muscle under the cautery clamp or over the joints of the cautery points, so that the joint is confirmed and the humidity is removed and the patient is cured
Chapter XXVI.
Of the cautery of the stomach.
When there is cold and mucus in the stomach due to excessive humidity, and when that excess of its composition comes out and you do not confirm it, then you must reverse the patient over the seat and extend their legs and thighs, and immediately cauterize with three cauteries: on one cautery leave the toes for the amount of one finger under the cautery clamp, and on two cauteries leave the two sides of the cautery, until the triangular mark of the cautery appears; and lengthen the parts that have not been adjusted which will make a reduction.
And if the depth of the cautery is equal to two-thirds of the thickness of the knee.
And the mark of the cautery is like this, and if you want, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach like this; and this is a circular cautery like this:
And cauterize the stomach punctate where it is sensitive: and that is when you sense over the stomach point according to the quantity you want on the hair, and immediately cauterize that point; and immediately care for that part with the care that precedes until it is cured
Chapter XXVII.
Of the cautery of the painful foot
When in the foot there is pain due to cold or humidity or for excessive wind, when the normal composition of the limb is excreted by excessive discharge, and it is cured as we have said and not confirmed, then you must reverse the patient over their shoulder, and sign over the hair three cauteries like this and with this quantity above the foot from the hipbones, holding the heel of the patient.
And the space between each cautery is according to the thickness of the finger, and the cauteries are like the length of the limb that is taut
And do not press on the cautery too much
And if the quantity of fluid that is absorbed is equal to the quantity of the major part of the substance of the knee, and it is not adjusted; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if they are not standing, then you must sit down, having already extended their thighs, and raise the buttocks
And you are able to cauterize these cauteries with a cautery needle, when it is at your skill and prudence in the art.
And keep in mind that you should not progress too much in the cautery, and that the substance of the whole knee should be cauterized so that all the parts are cauterized and reach the intestines, because the knee here is subtle; and be careful
Chapter XXVIII
Of the perforation of the swelling of the foot with a cautery
When there is an extrusion or swelling in the foot and you want to know if that swelling is in the bone of the foot or in the membrane of the limb, then if it is in the bone of the foot, the patient has a severe swelling and pain is acute
If it is in the groin, the pain is greatly increased and often the doctors already abandon the care of such patients.
Therefore cover the patient with a sheet; and almost immediately touch the area of the abscess with the cautery; and almost immediately ignite the cautery which is made of lead, as described previously on the other page.</end_of_turn> And burn until all the pus is consumed, until it reaches the cartilage, until it is scabbed over.</end_of_turn>
And take care of the rest of the abscesses until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
And do not use this method of cautery except for those who have been studied in the art of medicine and in most of whom many bad diseases have been known; for indeed with this method one must experiment some times either with regard to this operation or to other similar ones. However, read what we must say about this, for it is better.</end_of_turn>

I say that the ancient cauteries of the roots of arithmetic applied to ulcers are done in this manner. Take from the roots of arithmetic a thorn about the length of a finger that is found, and of the thickness of the thumb.</end_of_turn
And immerse that in oil and put that in the fire, and then burn with a cautery in that place which is between the continuation of the furcula to the heel; and with two small cauteries leave guiding, one slightly declining towards the part which is below the beard, and two cauteries downwards between the fifth costal cartilage and the twelfth, declining slightly towards the parts behind; and one cautery in the middle of the foot; and another over the stomach, and three cauteries on the posterior parts; and one cautery in that place which is between the two buttocks, and two cauteries on the two sides of the foot, leaving the cautery which is between two buttocks.
And do not hold your hand over the cautery, but rather in the manifestation of the wound in work.</end_of_turn
And indeed I say that the old doctors were like those of the men who use the cautery of iron like a ray and ignite that, and put that in that place which is between the ribs, until we reach that abscess and it is cured, as we have said concerning the abscess of the groin.</end_of_turn
However, in this perforation there is no fear, because we often see that many people die in the fistula to which they do not recover.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of the abscess.</end_of_turn
When you have cured the disease of the abscess according to what we have said in the division, and you do not confer your care, then the hour of the cautery in it is according to three ways, which are all safe, either that you make three cauteries or four in line according to the length of the abscess according to the figure of the cauteries of the groin, the figure of which has preceded.</end_of_turn>
And between each cautery let the thickness be that of a finger or a little more, and the manner of the cautery should be the manner which we have said in the cautery of the groin exactly.</end_of_turn
And do not hold your hand over the cautery; and the patient should be even above the two buttocks.</end_of_turn
And another way of cauterizing is that you ignite the cautery having two veins, which we have mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the muscle, and elevate the limb which is at the end of the abscess towards the honor, so that the pain on the left side is relieved.</end_of_turn
And let your elevation be such that you elevate the limb according to the length of the body, so that the cauteries can be made according to the width of the body.</end_of_turn
And almost immediately insert the two veins, ignite them both, in that place where they penetrate the limb from the other side.</end_of_turn
And almost immediately withdraw the cautery; and thus there are four cauteries in total.</end_of_turn
Or if you wish, cauterize with three veins.</end_of_turn
And take care of the patient more than if he had lain without moving for days, because it is different in the care of this cause than in the preceding ones.</end_of_turn

Cautery does not burn in hydropic but in fat properly.
When you are treating hydropic, with the methods of care which we have said in the division, and do not confer your care, then you must cause that four cauteries be made on the circumference of the abdomen and one on the stomach, and one on the heel, and one between the vertebrae of the two, and two on the flanks, and one on the great toe, and one on the stomach. And the quantity of the depth of the cautery is proportional to the size of the wound
And do not remove the cautery until it is well closed.
And do not evacuate the patient from care immediately after the cautery because it covers that they are being added to them two meanings, and do not eat with them until they are healed with the help of the physician

It is like this: And make two cauteries on the two parts of the foot, and on any part make one cautery at the end of the cautery cut And the cautery is like the length of the part: leave the nail of the toe that is above and the nail of the toe that is below in the place of the part; and make two cauteries on each part
And leave the wound open until your care is finished so that any water will drain from it

And if you think that the stomach of them is inflamed and the food is not digested, and their face is sometimes pale, then make a great cautery on the stomach according to what has preceded; and one on the heel and one on the chest, and one claw-shaped, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then care for them until they are healed

When you abscess the thigh, then make the cautery which is like a ray on it And between put out the fire in that thigh abscess, and finish your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes out.
And thus we make a burn or two, for if these reach the tops, then we cauterize each one according to what we have recounted, and then we care for those who suffer from these burns until they are healed.
And if we burn with a large cautery on anything, it is better delayed in judgment.</end_of_turn>

Therefore, when there is a fistula in the nature that is old, corro with old blood and corrupted humors, and thus what is more deserving than to cover it is to try to uncover it, and indeed with as much gentleness as the front of the matter suggests.</end_of_turn
And indeed we make the burn like a ray of light.</end_of_turn And thus we put that burn onto that fistula, and according to the quantity in which we pierce the attempt.</end_of_turn
And you repeat this burn until those corrupted parts are consumed by fire, once or twice or three times, according to the quantity of your need.</end_of_turn>
And take care of the burning of nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes to the bladder or to the belly, then keep away from all those parts; and do not do anything until the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it is not penetrating.</end_of_turn
And care for the place until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if the place is sealed, and so we remove from it the matters, and remain like this for a long time, then know that it is already completely healed.</end_of_turn

And the length of each burn is according to the degree of the swelling; and we cauterize with a single burn in the lower part of the thigh, or with two burns if necessary.</end>

Of the cautery of the sciatic vein.</end_of_turn
When there is pain in the ankle area, and it is caused by cold and humidity, the patient is cured with what we have said and not otherwise. When it is old, then you must remove the bad humors from the patient with laxatives or artificial pills or something similar; and then cauterize that.</end_of_turn
And the manner of cautery in that case is in two ways: either with medicinal herbs or with fire.</end_of_turn
Thus according to two learned methods, one of which is to cauterize that on the ankle area with three triangular cauteries as shown, and to do so with sufficient depth.</end_of_turn And the space between each cautery should be according to the thickness of the finger, and if the cautery is olive-sized or greater.</end_of_turn
Some people put the cautery over the middle of the ankle for four cauteries.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize around the circle which precedes the shape of the dislocation of the ankle, and which is a continuous circle and consumes the spiciness of the whole codena.</end_of_turn
And this is the manner of cautery for the in ciatiqua when the pain is adherent to the ankle and does not extend into the thigh.</end_of_turn>
If it extends into the thigh, then cauterize with two cauteries on the thigh over the area where you sent the pain; and with one cautery on the hip for four fingers a little beyond the waist.</end_of_turn
And if the cautery is too deep, and the depth of the cautery is according to the quantity of the spiciness of the codena.</end_of_turn
If the patient sends that the pain extends up to the feet, then cauterize here where you sent the cautery with three or four points or more if you wish.</end_of_turn
If the patient sends that the pain is remaining even after the swelling has gone down, then cauterize here with a single deep cautery.</end_of_turn
And keep this in mind in all cauteries that you should not finish the cautery until you have burned nerves or great vessels, and that for this reason it is over the patient that is about the pain and not the contraction.</end_of_turn
And I have seen others who have cauterized on the hip and finished the cautery, and the limb became swollen until the tumor achieved the foot, and the limb was perforated and corrupted throughout.</end_of_turn And take a strong solution of vinegar, and thus the death.</end_of_turn
And if the pain is in two parts together, cauterize each according to this method.</end_of_turn
And let the learned men know that in the cautery of the ankle the cautery which is like a circle of iron whose circumference is the size of a palm; and be over the nails or orifices according to the thickness of a date seed or less.</end>
And draw that circle a third time; and the space between them be according to the quantity of the pulse; and these circles should be united from two parts; and the length of these strokes should be one or two nails, and make in these marks of iron diligently around the circles; and this is the form of them.</end>
And let there be fire in the fire until it is consumed and gets sparks, and let it be suspended over the ankle, and the patient lies on the side of the ankle.</end Therefore, cauterize with three cautery needles around the joint in a circle.
And leave it for three days; then apply a compress to the border and leave the wound open for several days; and care for the joint until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Say Albucasis: or, friends, with this kind of cautery we have rarely used for the terror of the people, and because few have found what they require concerning it.</end_of_turn>
More of these cautery needles should be made to them who suffer from it, and find out at what place they are.</end_of_turn
More cautery is better than medicines that remain; for you must make two circles with the needle having pierced the skin, in which you should put the patient's thumb and index finger of the foot; and the length of the line from the ankle to the knee should be two walnuts or as many as those.</end_of_turn
And if the space between the thumb and the other fingers is equal to the quantity of the thickness of the finger; and that they are opened wide and relaxed, and that they contain each other in this manner:
Then place your hand over the ankle of the patient and support the heel of the foot on the side; and compress your hand over the ankle; and take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and the quality of that should be neither too hot nor too cold, and keep it for the amount of an hour, and suffer the pain of the patient the biting and the swelling of the foot — for that other biting is like fire — until the biting stops.</end_of_turn>
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wash the warm water from the ankle with cold water.</end_of_turn
And leave it for three days and rest on that border until the black of the swelling has gone; and leave it for a few days, and run away from it when it is reduced; this is better for the patient.</end_of_turn
Care for the joint until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if the pain extends into the thigh or the leg, make it stand in water as is done for the ankle swelling.</end_of_turn
This is the way of warm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.</end_of_turn Recipe for alkali and caustic of both parts one, and grind them and rest in new water from which the part left is perforated with a small hole according to the amount that enters into it.</end_of_turn
Rest for a while the bottom of the new water and get over that alkali and caustic alive with lukewarm water which takes those things up for a finger, and when you have compressed those with your thumb for good compression, and leave the rest that comes out of the water into the new water.</end_of_turn
And adjust all that water, and take another caustic alive and another alkali renewed, for that water if it remains still has strong acidity, which is administered in surgical operations of medicine and in cauterization of the other members, for that operation is like fire.</end_of_turn
And of some medicines that are cauterized widely, some are as fast as the azalea and as sweet as honey and caustic with sulfur that are mixed together.</end_of_turn
And behold the report of an ancient man concerning the operation and care with which the pain of the ankle and sciatica is cured, and magnify more than enough that, in this way, there is no need for any other care, and that he is healed for a whole week in this way, as recommended, for that strong thread that is taken in bath and ice has already taken effect from that.</end>
And it is taken with certainty of green herbs, and if it is not found green, take a recent fig; and do not grind it with much gray, but rest it on the ankle where the pain is, or in the thigh or leg, and bind it.</end_of_turn
And let it be left for the amount of three hours or for the amount that the patient allows of the swelling's departure.</end_of_turn
And so put it in bath and when the limb is stiff, put it in the sun, for the pain will cease and it will be healed.</end_of_turn
Note that these cautery needles should only be used with these medicines when the limb is evacuated.</end_of_turn
And indeed it is said that when a vein of a goat is cut, the cautery is applied immediately; and that the cautery is to be made in this manner: take wool and dip it in oil against the cancer, and rest it between the heel and the ankle.</end_of_turn
And so make a dry incision from the heel towards the toes; and immediately after, lay that over the bone and stretch it out. And repeat this process, and do not cease until the sensation of the bite reaches the ankle and relieves the pain
And this method of cautery is called the cautery of cows

About the cautery of pain of two.
Some doctors consider pain of the two kinds to be caused by various factors, such as inflammation or percussion or excessive evacuation, and by such causes as well as by the infusion of hot and humid matter
And do not cauterize except for this kind which is caused by the effusion of hot matter
Therefore cover, immediately evacuate the patient with pills that are fitted and similar to them, that they are sufficient over the two in which the pain is three lines according to their latitude, because if you do not have enough in any line or cauterize or may, according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance and the virtue of them
And the cautery must be dry with point cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries or with four in the middle according to this form:

About the cautery at the beginning of inflammation
Many doctors consider this disease in small children; and a sign of the beginning of it in children is that it affects their bones in the heel and causes them to limp and swell.
And so it is seen in the back that the vertebra of the two and of the three already begins to dominate over the others
Therefore when you see this and you wish to forbid it, then cauterize that which is circular according to this form that it surrounds the cautery over the whole extent of the vertebra equal
And if you wish, cauterize in the circumference of the vertebra with two-line or three-line point cautery And let the points be close to each other
And so take care of the area until it is healthy with the water that we have said
Beware that the cautery is not administered in inflammation that is caused by the spasm of nerves

About the cautery of gout and joint pain
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors
Therefore when gout is caused by excessive heat, it is cured by means of treatment and not by leaving the pain, and the cautery is left
And so you cauterize the area around the evacuation of the foot around the joint with more than one cautery
And let the cautery be of olive oil of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery And if the pains ascend to the ankles or to the other joints, and when the matter moves, then cauterize over every painful area with three or four cauteries of this olive oil
And if more than these cauteries are necessary, then cauterize and do not leave your hand too close to the cautery, but rather leave only the tip of the cautery exposed
And if the pains penetrate the heel and the two, then administer the cautery that we have said in the preceding chapter
And if the pains are only in the bones only and are severe, then puncture in the circumference of the bones just as if it were a wheel, puncture in those two lines
And if there remains pain in these things, then puncture in the circumference of the bones over each bone and over the base of the thumb
If pain spreads throughout the limbs or joints and extends to the feet, physicians usually call it gout.
Do not evacuate the patient hastily and without medical advice, for if it is well-regulated and there is inflammation, evacuate it only with this pointed cautery if necessary, God helps.</end_of_turn>

Of cautery for fractures.</end_turn>
When a fracture occurs in the limbs and saying the swelling outward from the belly button, and when it begins to approach, order that the patient lie still and use soft supports so that the wound does not open from the belly button.</end_turn
And follow the patient closely between your hands on the belly, and command them to keep the belly button inside until the wound is closed or the swelling or hernia disappears.</end_turn
And return the limb immediately and bind the fracture above the fifth bone with a sign that resembles the great circle of the circumference of the limb.</end_turn
And this is the form of the cautery:
Until it is neither too hot nor too cold and has cinnamon stripes.</end_turn Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</end_turn
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.</end_turn
And place the cautery over that sign with your hand over the cautery, and when you have brought the fifth bone inside the ankle; repeat this three times if you have not managed to bring it down in the first attempt onto the bone.</end_turn
Observe cautiously the color of the swelling at the time of your cautery, that you do not burn the patient so that there is neither death or other great harm to the patient.</end_turn
And be aware that when you have finished cauterizing do not neglect the bone, do not trust your operation.</end_turn
And the cautery of children should be subtle according to their age and measure.</end_turn
And take care of the area of the cautery for three days with borders until the burn mark is healed.</end_turn
And take care of those with other ailments until they are healed.</end_turn
And the patient should rest on the belly for forty days until the area is healed and the wound and swelling have disappeared.</end_turn
And provide that the patient abstains from food according to the length of time of their treatment, which will heal the wound of the belly, and that the swelling does not come out due to the effort of healing.</end_turn
And when it is time to take away the cautery after forty days, order that suitable medicine be administered adequately, and keep it for other forty days.</end_turn
Remember work and refreshment of food and drink, and harsh speech, for when you use this regimen of treatment entirely the patient will be completely healed.</end_turn></end_of_turn>
And I say the treatment of fractures in other parts of the belly, and so at the beginning, and do not neglect, when you cauterize the fracture of that which is redone as much as it is, and that which is extruded from the navel as the third part of it; and take care of that which we have said, and do not be adjusted.</end_turn
And I have already said that the first fracture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this way, because it is a sign with a handle.</end_turn
And it is stopped with a line that lies for the width of the limb beyond the fracture, and another line below; and put your hand on with a claw cautery, for the first cautery is more painful and better.</end_turn

Of cautery for dislocation.</end_turn
When there is pain in various limbs due to dislocation or percussion and the pain persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, order that the physician cauterize with a pointed cautery.</end_turn
The cautery should be applied according to the size, shape, nature, and location of the area in pain.
Therefore if the first burn is sufficient, it is enough; otherwise repeat the burn several times until the pain subsides, for it is known that these pains are caused by points that approach each other on the limb itself, so that when the burn is made on the part that is close to the pain, it covers that which is under it until the pain is gone.</end_of_turn>

Of cautery for leprosy.</end_of_turn>
Many books speak of cautery made on the leprosy with great zeal, and manage to obtain a greater benefit if the kind of leprosy that causes corruption of flesh and melancholy is present.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you wish to cauterize him, consider whether the leprosy is widespread and whether that which has been cured with what we have said in the division does not remain, neither this, and fear the disease which the corruption includes throughout the whole body and all its members, for in this way cauterize him upon the head with two cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second behind it, leaving the hair in between; and on the front over the eyebrows; and on both sides over two nails; and one behind, over the nape or the shoulder.
And finally keep your hand over the burn for a little while until a small scab has formed on the bone, and when the scales have fallen off, the evacuation of thick vapor will be eased from it; and cauterize over the middle according to the necessity.</end_of_turn>
And if the leprosy has already spread over the body and appears to be evident, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with these same cauteries which we have said in the head; and on the tip of the nose, and two on the two upper eyelids, and two on two vertebrae of the neck, and five on the vertebrae of the chest, and one on the hip bone, and two on each ankle, and two on the toes, and two on the muscles of the thighs; and two on the joints of the fingers and toes, and on any nail of the feet; and on the wisdom teeth.</end_of_turn
Be careful not to burn the nerves that are on the heel so that you do not damage them.</end_of_turn
Many are cauterized with a single cautery on the fifth toe and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the heel.</end_of_turn
You know that the more cauteries you make, the more benefit and more comfort there will be; and you know that the patient does not feel pain in the cautery, even as much as he has suffered before, for the body has already become insensible.</end_of_turn
You must make the cauteries large or small according to the members and the joints as it is preceded by the properties of the instruments.</end_of_turn
And pay attention to the burn with flour of herbs with honey and the other care so that it should be healed.</end_of_turn

Of cautery for stupor.</end_of_turn
When any limb is stiff or drowsy and is being treated with medicines, oils and plasters, and is not healing, then you cauterize the stiff limb with cauteries as it deserves according to the greatness of the limb or the smallness of it.</end_of_turn
And make the burn penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin a little.</end_of_turn And pay attention to that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And sometimes a stupor is cauterized in the fingers and toes, and on the vertebrae of the chest and sometimes you see the numbness of the nerves which move that limb, and it is healed.</end>
Do not presume more than what is known about the anatomy of the limb and the exit of the nerves throughout the body.</end_of_turn

Of cautery for ulcers that are rotting.</end_of_turn
When ulcers are old and do not yield to the touch of medicine, then you cauterize over that a little with a burn beforehand according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin until the whiteness and the color of it are restored, and the color of it is changed.</end_of_turn
And thus care for him with barley, lentils, olive oil, and balm of marigolds, and with columb or yeround, give each a part and mix them all together, and let it be applied until he is healed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.

When some adubilati are delayed in maturity, and this is either because of excessive fatness or because of the state of the patient, who is old in decrepitude, of little strength, or for the time, and you wish to hasten the maturity of the adubilati; then cauterize in the circuit of them small punctures; and thus will it halt the fasting of the maturity.
And if you wish to make a perforation of them, then do so with the cautery of which this is the form: and stop that in the middle of the adubilati until you penetrate the tendon.
And if you do it in that place which is more left, in order that the limb of the arm may be relieved; and thus care for him until he is healed.

Corrosion is a walking corruption in the limb, which gnaws at whatever it touches as though it were fire eating dry wood
Therefore if sometimes that corrosion is in the place where you suffer the cautery with fire, then do you cauterize nails a few at a time, as it is convenient in that place where it is corrosive
And thus cauterize all around until you have eradicated all the corruption and there remains no cause of it
And thus rest for three days, and stop over the cauterized places until three days have passed since the application of the oil mixed with oil until the scars have all disappeared and all the corruption has gone away.
And thus care for him with barley, lentils, olive oil, and balm of marigolds, and with columb or yeround, give each a part and mix them all together, and let it be applied until he is healed.
And if even after three days the flesh appears sound in the place where there is no corruption, it is not good; but if so, then repeat the cautery over that which is soft in the corrupted places
Corrosion is sometimes treated with various herbs and acute medicine, which is half in the place of cautery Fire cautery is not so useful for this purpose<end_turn>
And I have already said the treatment of this with acute medicine in the division, and so take that when you have need of it
Here comes the first sentence to translate. Do not add any comments, like "here is the translation", just reply with the guessed translation and nothing else:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery
When the nails of the foot are diseased and cause pain, they are called claw nails; and it is a great cause, which makes the foot swell; and the cautery is done in two ways, one with fire and the other with cold water
Fire cautery is not so useful for this purpose, for you must kindle the cautery with a flame similar to that of a burn, which is made of iron according to the quantity of the nail which you must cauterize from the whole, and of fine stripes
And immediately pause the fire on the claw, and immediately turn your hand towards the nail within the claw until the nail reaches the depth of the claw. And let it rest for three days until it begins to swell And immediately apply a compress of salt-preserved salves over the wound, and let the compress rest on the wound for a night, so that the pain will be eradicated from its root
And take care of the wound with ointment made from animal fat until it is healed
If it does not improve, and swelling appears on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, the doctor must administer in those nails with lukewarm water, and take a sponge or iron or vinegar, and place it over the nail; and let a little of the lukewarm water drain from the sponge, and keep your hand over it, and turn the sponge with your hand from all sides, and press the edge of the sponge onto the root of the nail, and hold the lukewarm water away from the root of the nail; and wait for the patient a little while for the pain of the lukewarm water to subside for an hour, and then remove it, because the nail will have regained its strength.
And thus do the others until they all have recovered from all of them
And take care of them until the roots of the nails have been eradicated with the ointments that are generated from the fat of the animals

Treatise on Tremor Cautery
When there is tremor due to cold in the nerves or from excessive heat, or from another similar cause, the doctor must cauterize at four points or five over the vertebrae of the two, between each vertebra with a cautery; and on the legs of the patient, and over the stomach, with olive oil
And the tremor will cease and the health of the patient will be restored

Treatise on Cautery of Injuries to the Body
When there are spilled abscesses in the body, and pus-filled wounds that are caused by corrupt thick matter; therefore, at the beginning when it appears, it must be cauterized over the whole head of the fistula with a fine needle and cautery, the extremity of which is extended towards the focus; or at the root of the fistula longus; or by cautery of the lenticular type
And in some cases it is necessary to cauterize immediately at the beginning of its expulsion according to this manner; and do not be discouraged, for the swelling will be dissolved by these means, and the patient will be cured of these things
But indeed let it be known that this is useful for the evacuation with flebotomy.

Treatise on the Cautery of the Flux of Sand Injury by Incision of the Artery
There are many wounds due to the flux of an artery that arise from the ulcer from which it originates, or from the incision of abscesses or cautery of the limb, and in this case it is difficult to stop it
Therefore when such a thing happens, immediately put your hand over the orifice of the artery and pause over it until the bleeding stops, and do not move from that place until the bleeding has ceased.
And immediately stop the bleeding with fine and thick cauteries, one after the other, and blow over them until they are no longer ignited.
And immediately take from those a little or a lot according to the wound and the ulcer from which the artery is broken, over which vein tightly cauterize until the bleeding has ceased and withdraw the cautery from that place
And when the blood has been expelled from the orifice of the artery when you withdraw the cautery, take another cautery and hold it firmly over the cauteries that are in the fire, and do not stop until the blood has clotted
Be careful not to burn the nerves that are there, and that no other illness arises from the patient.
And you know that when an artery bursts blood, it is not possible to restrict the blood by these methods, especially if the artery is large, except by one of four things: either by cauterizing as we have said, or by extraction when it is not extracted, or when it is extracted the limbs are burned and the blood is restricted, or that it is tied with thread or strong ligature, or that it is supported with medicines whose virtue is to restrict the blood flow; and that it is strengthened by dusting with powder of costriccio downwards
The physician should restrain the patient firmly both with ties and stricture of the gown or by placing the patient in a position that eliminates the cause of the inflammation and discomfort. Otherwise, you will do them more harm than good.
If the patient has not eaten or drunk anything and the physician is not present, or there is no medicine available, the hour indicates that the disease is serious. Understand that the patient is groaning in great pain, and do not leave them without treatment; do not delay in applying cold water to the wound until the pain is relieved and the swelling has subsided; and do not neglect to cauterize or treat the underlying cause of the pain.</end_of_turn>
On incision and perforation and windings and of opening up the belly and of ulcers and of their appearance.</end_of_turn>
We have already said in the first chapter that in all diseases in which cautery is convenient and medicine is comburent, and the occasions and causes of these, and the instruments necessary for their forms, have been ordered in the preceding chapters.</end_of_turn
And I will proceed in this chapter according to that method which is useful for healing the sick, about what has been demanded of me.</end_of_turn
And while I begin, know that in this chapter is for fear what is in the first chapter of cautery.</end_of_turn
And for this reason we must exercise great caution, for in this operation there is great danger of causing evacuation of the bowels, which is both harmful to the patient and dangerous for life if the vein is torn or if the incision is made over the abscess or if there is opening of the belly or evacuation of the plague or extraction of a splinter or incision of a stone.</end_of_turn And all these things are accompanied by fear and tremor and in most of them death.</end_of_turn
I admonish you that you should not attempt anything in this regard, for there are many people who handle such matters with greater skill and wisdom than you.</end_of_turn And it is better for you to leave the treatment of your illness to those who are skilled in this and who are accustomed to dealing with such matters, for they are well aware of the dangers of these things and of the pain and suffering they can cause, and they know how to treat them effectively.</end_of_turn
And this is what gives rise to your fear and saying, your expectation of healing, and the harmful nature of your disease.</end_of_turn
Therefore do not consent to any one who proposes this treatment to you; and your caution should be greater than your desire and your eagerness; and do not presume any cause except for one which you are certain is effective and which promises to bring about a lasting healing.</end_of_turn
And use in the care of all these diseases the prognosis and indication which are useful for the preservation of health and for the restoration of glory, for in this lies your greatest aid to fame and memory, to love and glory.</end_of_turn
Oh, children, God be with you and give you understanding and guide you, for he is in your hand.</end_of_turn>
And I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished from the chapters concerning cautery, concerning the care of the head and the limbs, so that it may be of service to you in the matters which you demand and which you require.</end>
First Chapter.</end_of_turn
Of the care of water which is contained in the heads of children.</end_of_turn>
I say that this disease often occurs in children and when the nurse delivers the child at birth, its life is in danger.</end_of_turn
And many times the cause of this is unknown.</end_of_turn
I have never seen this disease except in children, and in all those whom I have seen it has caused death, and this is why I have undertaken to write about it.</end_of_turn
I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, the head of which was always swelling up, so that it could no longer bear its own weight, and that even when the physician was unable to support it, it died from the swelling.</end_of_turn
This moisture is either added between the cartilage and the bone, or is added outside the bones over the cartilage.</end_of_turn
For when the moisture is between the navel and the hip bone and the pus is little, then you must make a cut in the middle of the foot with a split two fingers wide, so that the moisture may run out.
And therefore if the moisture is more increased and the pus is greater, then two incisions are made according to this manner:
And if the moisture remains in the bones, a sign that the abscess of the head is open and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your thumb against the flanks, and it is not what you would expect from it.</start_of_turn> So you must make three incisions in the middle of the foot according to this manner:</start_of_turn
And so extract all the moisture; then strengthen the incisions with strips and feathers; then pour oil over it and vinegar until the fifth day, and then remove the ligament and care for the wound with attempts and ointment, and strengthen the foot equally; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the limb is comforted and healed.</start_of_turn>
And another method of incision is to consider the size of the abscess and the collection of water, for some veins are more prominent in the occipital region, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore attend to the incision where the abscess appears and the escape of the water, and cut as little as possible.</start_of_turn
And note that you must not cut the artery, and keep the patient calm and quiet, and feed the patient for the flow of blood with the evacuation of moisture.</start_of_turn
Chapter III.</start_of_turn
When swelling appears on the toes or thighs, and it is old, and you do not trust in the cure of medicines, then the best cure for this is the incision of those two arteries.</start_of_turn
And so it is necessary when you wish to make the incision that the patient should raise the limb high up, and press the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and strengthen the patient's hand at some mark; and consider where the vein is located; and the places where some of the veins which are close to the ankles are depressed, and do not go further unless in the case of some people.</start_of_turn
And so about the arteries that are around the ankle, try to pierce them with a tentative incision, and make an incision at the apex of each part that is acutely painful at the incision to reach the bone, and be careful of the water.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, remove the pus from outside the artery and join the incisions at the parts beneath.</start_of_turn
And the length of the incision should be two fingers wide, for when any vein is cut the blood is ejected with a pulsatile flow, which leaps from side to side frequently.</start_of_turn
More if the artery does not appear on the palpation, then you must measure the ankle to determine the amount of space of three fingers, and try again, and cut into the bone.</start_of_turn
And what you must get from the blood is the amount of one ounce.</start_of_turn and do not take more or less than that, but do so according to the amount that appears from the virulence of the disease and the emptying of the artery.</start_of_turn
And consider the wound, and therefore if there remains on the bone any cause of pain, then you must cut again so that no abscess arises from the cautery.</start_of_turn
And strengthen the wound with feathers and strips of linen, and care for that which is inflamed until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter III.</start_of_turn
Of the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.</start_of_turn
When some ancient or acute accidents happen, for agricultural humidity and for the quality of the lacerations of the temples, or because of an ancient violent infection that seems like those, and when medicine cannot cure them, then we must resort to the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or the cauterization of those in the same way as we have shown.</start_of_turn
And the method of the operation and extraction of those is that the patient raises the limb for the ones for which they are in the temples; and understand that the artery that appears in the temple is that which you have shown with your finger, and that it is hidden except in a few people because of its ferocity.</start_of_turn
If it is hidden from you, the hour of the patient's suffering is strong with some medicine; and quickly apply a rough or evaporating medicine to the area until the swelling appears clearly. And thus you take hold of the patient's flank, of which this is the form: And quickly grasp the heel at that place where it is easier until you reach the swelling; and grasp in it behind and extract that from the surrounding parts until you extract that from the heel and uncover that which you left behind from the whole part.</start_of_turn>
Moreover, if the artery is narrow, the hour encompasses that part with the limb, and quickly cut away a part according to the quantity for which the limbs are elongated and contracted, and do not let blood flow, for if they are not cut away, it will not cure the ailment.</start_of_turn
And quickly evacuate blood from the wound one cubic inch.</start_of_turn Until three.</start_of_turn>
And if the swelling is great, the hour covers that you bind that in two places with strong gut or strong strings, and do not leave it putrefy until the consolidation of the plague has occurred and let blood flow.</start_of_turn
And quickly evacuate the superfluous which is between two ligaments; and do that in that hour or do it at another time.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize that with a pointed cautery within the bone, and leave it until the limbs are relaxed, and do this work instead of that.</start_of_turn
And it is better work if the patient has a fever or is suffering from scaly congestion; for the cautery is of those causes that help to finish the humors, and therefore it is better in judgment.</start_of_turn
And cover quickly the extraction of the arteries that you see in the ankle, and keep them covered with fine powder diligently done, and do not let it dry out until it is healed with dry medicines that cause the flesh to swell and soften until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if while you are working another vein leaks blood from the artery, the hour you must cover that blood, or that you cauterize it, or that you fill the ankle with something, and hold your hand over that until the blood flow is stopped.</start_of_turn And if none of these causes are present for you, the hour suspends the thigh mentioned above until the blood is congealed, and soak the area with cold water of violent coldness until the pain subsides, and be strong as you please.</start_of_turn
And what is more curious in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with two clips having two teeth, since you have marked the two places with a finger, and take away some, not burning, until you reach the bone and split the vein in two places, so that it is elongated what is between the limbs, which are not consolidated at all by this cautery.</start_of_turn
And this is the form of the cautery:</start_of_turn
And the sharpness of the two teeth is enough.</start_of_turn More importantly, if they are of smaller sharpness than two teeth, it is better, for if they are sharp as two teeth close to each other, they do not bite the flesh with speed.</start_of_turn
Therefore when there is some thickness, keep the fire hot in those and the flesh is split with fear.</start_of_turn
This work is better in all work and more pleasant.</start_of_turn>
And the space between two teeth is the quantity of the thickness of the finger.</start_of_turn
End of text.</start_of_turn
Of the care of the limbs affected by sharp and acidic humors of the bones.</start_of_turn
When the acids are humors, and it is the limb of those veins which are over the head of the ankle, and do not suffer from any cause of medical care, and sometimes the face of the patient already swells up and sits down in front of walking like a walk of ants, and the bones of that limb are extended, huming loudly that they have already been recognized, and the nails are scaled by the sharpness of the tears, the old practices mixed in the care of these are now useless, and do not do that care with space.</start_of_turn
And you command the patient to move his heel away from the places where they are in the front, and quickly make three incisions equally distant according to the length of the front.</start_of_turn If the length of the fracture lies two fingers: one fracture be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the face, and the second according to the length of a little movement of the eyelashes which are on the lacrimal, and the third of the other side.
Keep your hand away from the start of the arteries which are in two lines, and prolong your hand from the continuation of both mandibles. And if the space of any incision is three fingers wide, adjust it accordingly.</end_of_turn>
And if there is a piece of sponge dressed or dry cloth moist with them which you will use to dry the wound.</end_of_turn>
Then insert between the palm of two sharp extremities, of which this is the form of the incision for them: that is from the upper part of the temples to the second incision.</end_of_turn> Excoriate all that whole chain which is between two incisions on the lip which is over the bone, and then make that which is from the incision to the second incision migrate into the second incision.</end_of_turn And then take away this sponge and enter with another vein another instrument which is called cautery, sharp at one end and blunt at the other.</end_of_turn
And hold the edge of that sharp thing which is against the soft part of the bone, and the edge of it which is against the bone does not penetrate the bone, and fill that up until it reaches the migrating fracture, and close with that all the blood vessels which go from the head to the feet.</end_of_turn
May be continued the incision until after the bone, and then make that which is in the migrating fracture enter into the other fracture.</end_of_turn
And when the wound has healed as much as possible, press the places of the feet of the wound with cotton wool.</end_of_turn
And then keep the wound from cracking by placing an old coat over the wound, and cover those powders with vinegar and oil and vinegar again, and whatever does not stick to the cautery.</end_of_turn
And on the third day remove the ligament and give great abundance of lukewarm water or broth, and care for that which is with ointment of beeswax with olive oil and other things until the wounds are healed.</end_of_turn

When in some cases there are acute catarrhs and they continue, and sometimes the feet of the patient extend slightly, and already in regard to them it is necessary to consider their weakness, and the ulcerated eyelids and their weight press upon them, and in the front of the head there is sharp pain leading to subsequent vomiting, for these accidents the matters and the catarrh do not suffice but for the veins of the distant parts.</end_of_turn
And the best cure for these is this: that the patient should chew less, and make an incision in the middle of the face, a little for the width (and begin with the left temporal vein until the right temporal vein; and let the incision be over the bone; and stretch your hand from the tears of the temples which are made by the chewing), until the bone is exposed.</end_of_turn
Dry all the wound with sponge or with dry cloth and then fill between the two lips of the fracture with old coat or with cotton cloth.</end_of_turn And then keep it away from sticking to the powders by pouring vinegar and oil over them.</end_of_turn
And when you have removed it and you see that the swelling has already diminished, the hours cover that the bones should be cold until they begin to feel soft, and then care for that which is with gentle drying which makes the flesh soft, just as if you took from wheat two parts and from barley four parts and mixed them together, or that you make plaster and administer it to these wounds as to the soft flesh which has not yet healed.</end_of_turn

About the care of that which catarrhs in the ears.</end_of_turn
Every cause which causes catarrh in the ears is of four kinds, either a mineral pebble or something similar to a pebble, such as iron and ivy, or of plant origin such as rue or peas, or a mobile cause such as vinegar and wine and their like.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when the stone is in the heel or for any other reason similar to those that do not adjust or grow in the heel, and it is supported by the heel alone, and sometimes the stone, the hour distills in any of those causes of olive oil or urine, and then administer the extraction of the stone, and make it vomit, and apply compresses to the area following the vomiting. And immediately stop the flow of the heel some pieces of fat or grease, and stretch the heel to the parts below, because swelling caused by these causes is harmful to this area
And if it is not harmful, the hour administers the extraction of the stone with the instrument called epicicarium subtle, of which this is the form:
And if it is harmful with the epicicarium, do not do it; otherwise, the hour administers the extraction of the stone with any other subtle means.</start_of_turn>
Therefore, if it is not harmful at all, the hour makes a needle of gut and inserts the extremity of the needle into the cavity of the heel and closes around the needle with wax and olive oil so that nothing is left except the needle itself.</start_of_turn And then extract with the gut thread with great attraction, because troops swelling like water that we have recounted.</start_of_turn>
Maybe if it is not harmful in this way, the hour takes hold of the inflamed or festering with which these are surrounded, and takes hold of the toes in the heel, and covers that with a bandage adequately stretched.</start_of_turn And then insert it into the cavity of the heel with ease, and immediately extract the heel from the moisture.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if it is not harmful from all the causes that we have recounted, the hour orders you to cut off that which is causing the pain, whether it be a splinter or spasm.</start_of_turn
And the manner of cutting off that which is causing the pain is that you first heal the inflammation of the saphenous vein and extract the stone according to the virtue of the stone, and then make that cease between your thighs and convert the heel to the parts below, and make a small fracture in the heel over the grey matter of the stone beforehand.</start_of_turn And the fracture should be of a crescent shape until it reaches the stone, and when the stone is grasped, obstruct that if possible with appropriate instruments; and immediately close the fracture at that hour, and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the cause of the pain in the heel is one of the fats that grow and infiltrate, the hour administers the cure and the extraction of the stone; but if you do not obey his order even then, the hour will take hold of you with force according to this method: and administer with that the excision of that fat which is causing the pain in the heel.</start_of_turn
And do not be astonished when you think that that is already moistened by the vapor of the heel, and stop it in pieces, and immediately extract it with nails or with a subtle instrument, or as we have said, since the extraction is alleviated.</start_of_turn
But in the water that enters the heel cover that the pain uses for vomiting at the beginning, and fill the sole of the heel with some old rags, and place over that heel the one in which the water is, and if because of that it is harmful, do not do it; otherwise, the hour takes hold of your thumbs and index fingers according to the length of the finger, and makes you bite those in the fire a little, and the patient puts one of those into the cavity of his heel and jumps over one leg of that part and beats with the other foot on the foot that is causing the heel to bend.</start_of_turn Therefore do not stop until all the water is harmful.</start_of_turn>
Therefore do not stop until all the water is harmful.</start_of_turn> And when the water is finally harmful, take paper or gut instead.</start_of_turn And put one extremity into the heel and extend the other extremity into the fire until the most of it is burned.</start_of_turn
And immediately put the other gut and make the water so many times until all the water is harmful, and then extract that with a needle as we have said.</start_of_turn
But in the extraction of stones that enter that heel, if it is small, push and hold it like this, care for it as we have said in the division; but if it is large that causes pain at the same time, the hour administers the extraction of the stone with instruments and nails, and the cause of the stone is less severe than all the other causes that cause pain in the heel.</start_of_turn
More in the extraction of worms engendered in the heel, when you cure that one which we have said in the division and in the treatise of distillations, do not neglect your care, for it is necessary that you require the heel to the sun.
And thus if there appears here any cause of the worms, then extract that one which is thick or viscous, even if no cause appears, then take a canula and draw it out wide; this is the form of them And insert the limb slightly into the heel according to the quantity which the patient suffers; and immediately suck upon that to extract well, and make water vapor, until all the worms are driven out
More if you do not obey me at this point, for I close the circle of the canula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which we have already mentioned in the care of worms, and you will find them in the treatise of distillations
And let your effusion be with the oils of the medicines in the heel with this instrument of which this is the form And make that of silver or gold, wide and straight, in which there is a small hole, and hold it out.
And thus it is like the handling of the continent here where it is necessary. And if you wish, take the ray and wrap it around the limb adequately tight, and immediately pour oil into the hollow of the limb, or juice of any herb, or water of whatever you wish of these medicines through the canula – that is in the heel – and immediately extract the ray with the thumb and press with your hand that which compression is temperate until the oil is expelled from the hollow of the limb and the patient has the oil remaining inside the limb.
And that which is infused in the heel is already scorched with fire a little And keep that the cause for which you distill in the heel is not too hot, for the medicines of the heel do not suffer from that.</start_turn>
Chapter VII.</start_turn>
Of the care of the opiling of the heel.</start_turn
Some veins of young children and young women are not pierced by the greater veins, and that which has already happened in some men, opiling in the meat of the heel for plague or for no other reason; and this opiling is useful in the preparation of the vein of the heel which does not always succeed, and some are in the outer parts
And that which happens in the preparation of it, which does not always succeed, is in the greatest precautions of difficult healing.</start_turn
And in that in which you succeed, cover that you stop the heel of the patient to the sun and require it in that.</start_turn And thus if sometimes there appears an opulation, open that which is like a small sponge of the which this is the form.</start_turn
If the limb is small in the width, of which one part is acute and the other not; and the sponge is of two lions so that it does not make the heel sore.</start_turn
And thus if the opiling is for a wound born in the heel or in the meat of the limb, then extract that which is thick and viscous and cut that with great ease until all the wound is gone.</start_turn
And if the opiling is in the preparation of the heel, then take a sponge of lion and burn that which is fire a little, and immediately put that on the meat of the heel.</start_turn
And thus if you smell an opulation in water in which the patient finds ease, for the greatness of the rise, endeavor to compress it with ease; and keep that you do not damage the nerves of the heel.</start_turn
And immediately stop the bleeding in the heel according to the quantity of the width of the hole which you have enveloped in Egyptian unguent; and make water for the limb for several days until you are sure of the consolidation of the wound; or that you take something and press that into the water and sprinkle over it some pounded herbs and use of it; and if sometimes the heel has already clotted, then cover that which you took out and change that for another which you will wrap in fat that is useful with oil of roses, until the clot is given up; and immediately care for that until it is healed.</start_turn>
More if an accident of discharge occurs, then submerge sponge or bandage in cold water and stop over the heel, and use another treatment which tightens the flow of discharge, which is said in the treatise of distillations.</start_turn
Capitol VIII.
Capital VIII. From the care of the swelling which arises from the eyelids.
Athezil which arise from the swelling of the eyelids due to any moisture, some are wet, others are dry
Therefore you must have those [points] well held, or well bound, and cut those which are in the roots, and then place your hand over the area to prevent them from breaking.
Maybe if there is pain from the flow of the blood, then you cauterize those which are pointed like lancets.
And the best cauterization is when the vesicles and tough veins are still inflamed; when they are cauterized while hot, those veins are consumed and do not return.
Capital IX.
Care of the great swelling that arises from the eyelids of the eyes
The wet spots arise from the eyelids of the eyes for any cause which is similar to a great swelling in its strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called great swelling
And it is an accumulation of large moisture in the inner eyelid and outside
Therefore the operation in them is to consider if the swelling is due to the excessive moisture in the eyelids, which is moist throughout; and the cause of it is lightness.
Therefore make an incision along the width, and drain that throughout easily so that it escapes, and suspend that which is on the outside and cut that.
And if the figure is great, then you adjust it with sutures; and care for that until it is healed
And if it is little, it will not be harmful to leave it as it is because the wound will restore itself and will scar
And if the swelling is declining at the margins of the eyelid, you must stretch the surface of the eyelid; then remove the swelling by cauterizing, another that you do not dig into the incision, and cut that throughout, and if the eyelid is elongated by the incision, it will not be noticed in any way
And finally, wash the wound with salt water; and care for the area around the wound until it is healed
Capital X
Of the care of the surrounding area of the eyelid outside the eye
Surrounding the area is gray which is generated in the membranes of the eyelid outside, and especially in children, it aggravates the eyes of those who suffer from it and makes them dull; and it does not allow the sun's rays to penetrate because the tears are moistened by them
Therefore sometimes those who are sweating on their faces all the time, and over their faces when they sleep; and over the eyelids of their eyes they have wet eyebrows, which already cover the swelling, and the imminent appearance of wrinkles is in the eye; and when you press on the area around the eyes, you see wrinkles within those
Every method of operation in that case is to put the thumb of the hand over the root of the hair and with the other hand make a circle according to the quantity that contains all the hair of the entire area, and when you have made the circle, press again on that area and cut throughout so that there is an accumulation of wrinkles in the middle of the circle, and finally make an incision along the width of the fold so that the fold is not greater than the incision that is made in flabby skin.
Therefore in the preparation cover that the entire hair is cut off so that only the wrinkles remain, because in this way wrinkles are processed by incision following the shape of white spots
Therefore extract that which you have wrapped with the drapes that you have placed between the thumb and the little finger and twist between the thumb and the little finger until it is dispersed.
And take care that you do not make the incision too deep so that the moisture does not reach the eye and remove that part.
But if you do not see the hair in the beginning of the incision, then adjust the incision slightly so that you can process the hair; and when you have processed the hair, remove that as we have said; and finally bathe the area with vinegar and wine and apply some powder over the area and dry those that are dusty
And thus it is that when salt is triturated and the excess is removed from the cavity of the wound, that which remains of that humidity will be left in the hollow of the fissure.
And thus it is that when salt is triturated and the excess is removed from the cavity of the wound, that which remains of that humidity will be left in the hollow of the fissure. And thus it is that the said humidity is cured.</end_of_turn>
And thus it is that when salt is triturated and the excess is removed from the cavity of the wound, that which remains of that humidity will be left in the hollow of the fissure. And thus it is that the said humidity is cured. More often, however, if the wound has been cauterized on the sole, the doctor should allow the eschar to fall off by itself, for it is cured when the underlying tissue has healed.</end_of_turn
Capitol XI.</end_of_turn>
Of methods of handling fevers.</end_of_turn
When the humors of the head grow lazy and limp, and their natural movements are hindered, then these humors become the cause of many illnesses, such as excessive weeping and the softening of the eyes and the membrane of the head. In such a case, there are four methods of treatment: either by cautery or by acute medicine as is mentioned in the chapter on cautery; or by incision and suture; or by trephination.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must hold the patient’s head down in the belly; then convert the eye of the limb to your left hand, and if it has been converted, well and good; otherwise, insert the needle in that place where you have faith of the part beyond the eyelashes, and make the needle penetrate the flesh beneath, and that which is — from the margin of the eyelid where the eyelashes depart — from the eyelashes, and pull the thread from the parts beneath the eyelid, and convert that to the ray.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must bring down the part of the eye beyond the eyelashes so that the eyelashes rest against the greater palpebral aperture; and then extract the thread and leave the eyelid covered with small pieces of lint or gauze, and press over the eye with your thumb, as with the figure of a leaf of myrtle.</end_of_turn
Therefore, however, you must take into account the degree of elevation of the eye, for that which is different in men, for some require that the large part of the eye should be incisized according to the degree of softening.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must take hold of the two lines which you have marked, and begin from the greater palpebral aperture towards the smaller.</end_of_turn And if the wound is upon the natural parts just as in the case of the king’s greatness.</end_of_turn
And thus it is that you must put on the sponge at one of the two angles of the wound, and then strip off that whole area, and with the fingers adjust the two lips upwards or downwards, and dry the wound, and stick whatever excess of thread over two eyebrows with various means, if you wish to do so, but do not cure if you do not wish.</end_of_turn
And thus it is that you must read the sutures of the wounds within three or four days, and then cure them.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, lay open the wound beyond the sutures, and cure that which exudes and contracts, because the eye is lifted from behind the sealing of the wound and the gathering of the parts; more suture is better. And thus I say to those who tax me.</end_of_turn
Therefore, however, in these matters it is necessary to consult about the patient, and it is a good operation, and do not be afraid.</end_of_turn
And thus it is that there is another method in treating, which is that you draw a figure upon the eye like a leaf of myrtle, and then raise the eye by three nails which are separated and converged in this manner:
And if this is not possible, take the nails, and that which is not blunt, and with a needle which has thread, insert that into the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread over the greater palpebral aperture, and the thread according to over the smaller, and adjust between the folds of the nails with equality, and then raise your hand with elevation equal to that which has been recommended.</end_of_turn
And thus it is that you must adjust the two lips of the wound with sutures, and cure that which remains when it is healed.</end_of_turn
And thus it is that if after the incision there remains any swelling around the wound or the wound itself, that you should keep that swelling down and support it, and apply cold packs.</end_of_turn
And thus it is that many herbs that are seen on the eye that cause it to swell must be avoided, so that you use in this one of the things which we have mentioned regarding incision; more suture is artificial.</end_of_turn
To cauterize the nail is according to this manner: Then you should shape the nail and split the figure according to what I have recounted; and for this purpose do two nails or two fine needles whose length is according to the length of the nail and whose width is less than the width of the cuticle.</end_of_turn> And you have already pierced the extremities of each part, where you have the threads.</end_of_turn>
Then add some slight substance over that which flows from the nail of the heel, and tighten the nails of each part with great stricture, and leave it for a few days, because the cord for the stricture will die and become soft and will disappear by itself.</end_of_turn
Even if it is late, when the nail has healed, then care for the wound until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, when it is solidified, the nail is elevated and the pain does not return.</end_of_turn>
And this is the way to do two nails according to this manner.</end_of_turn> pay attention to the quantity of the length and the width, neither more nor less.</end_of_turn

From the elevation of the pain in the heel when the nail is hard.</end_of_turn
When the nails are unnatural, hard and rough and pierce the heels, the custom in their treatment is that you take a fine needle and pass it through the centre of the callous and lemon, and that you hold the extremities of the nails and do not move them in any way.</end_of_turn And the length of the nails is like the quantity of a palm.</end_of_turn
And then take another fine needle and leave it in place for a while, and do not move the extremities of that.</end_of_turn
And then place the patient face down on the couch if possible, and be close to the sun so that your work is declared, because it is a subtle and small operation.</end_of_turn>
And then insert the needle into the root of the nail adjusted which has needed to be excised, and make that penetrate into the nail quickly until you extract that which is not the natural nail.</end_of_turn
And then withdraw the nail inside and immerse it in oil, and leave them in for one or two or three days and no more.</end_of_turn
And then withdraw your hand from that until the nail is removed with oil from the nail of the natural nail.</end_of_turn
If the nail is not softened by the oil and is not withdrawn, apply oil to the parts around the nail that you have cauterized until the nail is softened from the root.</end_of_turn
And so it is with the vision of the heel, because when you have cauterized the nail and the thread, groan somewhat and clench the heel, and leave it closed for two days or three, until the nail adheres to the skin and appears on the good nail.</end_of_turn
If the nail is shorter than the natural nails, then you adjust a longer nail to that, and elevate it like that, or that you leave it until it is elongated to almost the space, and when that is done you elevate that.</end_of_turn

On the care of the wound that appears in the heel from under the nail.</end_of_turn
When there appears in the heel a wound from under the nail, and the nail contracts when it is contracted in its entirety or to the left or right side, due to bad consolidation of the wound or section or cautery, and if it is caused by leprosy, this is either natural or accidental, and is useful for consolidating the wound or section or cautery, or for preventing it from becoming deformed.</end_of_turn
The manner in which to perform the operation in this case is that you make that consolidation and separate the edges of the wound, and leave it in oil until there is a piece of silk between them, and tie them up until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And do not use any remedy for the cause of the wound, except for constriction; for if you do this you will make things worse rather than better.</end_of_turn
Use in such cases that which softens them as fenugreek, and embroider with water in which the nails are soaked to a height of half an inch and seeds of flax, or ointment of diaper, which is liquefied with some oil, and immerse in this the piece of silk, and care for it.</end_of_turn
The treasure of your care is that you perform everything without solidifying it according to the manner in which you began.
The operation which we have mentioned is nothing other than the rectification of swelling that does not restore the limb to its former shape as before.</end_turn>

About the care of swelling that is useful in the eyelids.</end_turn
This swelling which is useful in the eyelids is properly called a true swelling; and it is either natural or accidental.</end_turn
Accidental swelling is caused by a wound or a cut or a burn or other similar things.</end_turn
And the way of performing the operation is that you take a needle and make a double thread, and fix that in the flesh, and pass the thread from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, through which the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.</end_turn
And then stretch the flesh around the needle and hold that with the needle, and make an incision at a wide space.</end_turn Therefore, if you restore the shape of the eyelid according to what you covered, it is not good; and if not, take the needle and hold that in the indented figure, and on that convert the eyelid, and close the two incisions on the side of the lower eyelid.</end_turn
And if the two extremities of the two incisions make two angles, the one that has been made inside will be of two angles, and the one that is left will be of two angles, so that when they meet, the figure will be restored.</end_turn
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.</end_turn>
And then keep the flesh that remains in the quantity that is the width of its belly, so that the eyelid is closed.</end_turn
And then adjust the separated parts and close them with the thread of silk; and then take care of them as for the medicines that we have mentioned and the patches that must be put on to make it healthy.</end_turn
And if the swelling has to be done for a wound or a suture or a burn, then cover that wound with a flat incision over the edge of the eyelid as it is said before.</end_turn And then separate the gauze between two lips as we have said.</end_turn
In summary of the word concerning the care of swelling when it is dry or oily, that runs in the operation, according as it is prepared in the manner of swelling, and that is in the manner of various patches.</end_turn
And the skilled physicians always prepare everything in every way possible so that it is possible for them to restore the figure to its natural shape, or in any case, that the patient is cured according to what is convenient for the operation and the instruments at their disposal.</end_turn

About the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.</end_turn
When this adhesion happens to several people at once, it is necessary to solidify the eyelid more than under the influence of the humors, and to prevent the facility of movement and its natural works, therefore you must remove the point of the needle from the eyelid, and lift it up with that, or stretch that with the thumb.</end_turn
And then make the adhesion solid with a soft sponge, which should not be of the same sharpness as the incisions, having made an obtuse point so that the patient is not distressed by the operation, and keep that sponge moist so that it does not dry out the eye.</end_turn
And the incision should be made as little as possible so that it does not irritate that adhesion until the eyelid is restored to its natural shape and the adhesion is completely healed.</end_turn
And then put in the eye salt water in which you wash; or distill it from vinegar dissolved in water.</end_turn
And then separate between the eyelid and the eye with gauze of lint, and put over the eye a pad of lint soaked in oil, and on the third day use adhesive substances until it is healed.</end_turn

About the incision of the nail and the prominence of the cartilage of the lacrimals.</end_turn
The wise say that the nail is according to two manners, that is, either it is nervous, and is similar to a hard, soft sponge; or it is non-nervous, resembling white moisture frozen, which when you touch it, or force it to take hold with the nail, is separated and the nail is not fixed in it.</end_turn
Both tears start from the large tear gland and gradually cover the eye, preventing light and movement of the pupil.
The manner of handling the patient at the incision is such that the patient should keep their head down in the belly, and at the same time grasp their heels, elevate the eyelid with your hand, and collect the nail on one side with little duplication and extend it to the other side.</end_of_turn> And take a needle and enter it into the heel of a horse or a calf or a sheep, or something similar, or strong thread, or double the extremity of the needle little by little and keep that in the middle of the nail, and pierce through that with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend that to the other side, and scratch the skin around the nail as much as the pupil allows.</end_of_turn> And if you have finished that at the back of the foot.</end_of_turn>
And keep your incision in the root of the lacrimal with a spatula or small forceps, and release the natural secretion of the lacrimal so that by incision of that there is no continuous discharge of tears.</end_of_turn
And as for the nail on the thumb, extend it with oil once spread or with thread, as we have said, and at the same time do the same with the nails of the little finger.</end_of_turn
And keep that the spatula does not touch the corneal tunic and that you avoid its rupture, and that the pupil is perforated.</end_of_turn
Then take the incision away from the eye and put a little salt or ointment on the wound, and keep that until the next day; and take care of that which covers within that so that it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If the nail is not nervous and you cannot put the needle in, nor is it pierced in that place, the way of treating this kind of nail is with medicines, and it is healed in the same way as before and as recommended in the division.</end_of_turn
And if you wish to make an incision in that case, then you or the patient should take away the smell of the patient and take a spatula of blunt forceps of acute freule according to this manner: With calmness.</end_of_turn> And if sometimes that is rare and is confused and comes into that place, the hours distill from your hour in the eye of the patient by making ointment or ointment or salt, and put the eye into the other day.</end_of_turn
And repeat that operation until everything that is of it is removed, except that the contrary aftercare is in the eye, which you must read, and care for the aftercare of the wound until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And repeat your operation concerning that reason until it is healed.</end_of_turn
The swelling of the lacrimal gland, if you notice it in the eye during the night, is suspended with oil; and make the incision of that part, and do not finish the incision so that no tears flow from it.</end_of_turn
And let the tears distill in the eye ointment or by making ointment until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the incision of the eyelids and what is born from a well-adjusted gland in the eye.</end_of_turn
Sometimes in the heels of the almonds there is a birth of a rough gland, and it is too large until it covers the pupil, or it approaches or expands over the eyelids and tightens the eyelids against the margins and is bound together like a balustra.</end_of_turn
The operation for that is that the patient keeps their head down in the belly; and at the same time grasp their heels and collect all that gland with nails convenient at once, and take hold of that with a forceps or a clip; and make the incision of the gland at the beginning until everything is finished with the surgeon, and take care not to touch that which you must leave from your operation.</end_of_turn
And your incision concerning which you must make that incision or with blunt forceps of which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small forceps as it is collected together according to how it will come in this chapter.</end_of_turn
Therefore when your incision is completed and all that gland is removed, then fill the eye with salt, or let it drip in powder form like common medicines, and put a bandage over the eye with a piece of cloth until the aftercare is complete.</end_of_turn
If there remains any cause of stiffness and it is urgent to cauterize, and you fear infection, then read the patient's pulse and care for that infection in the place where it subsided. Then repeat the cautery over that until it is healed, and simultaneously perform the usual care which is customary for this kind of ailment.
However, you must know that all treatment for such an infection is either natural or accidental, or with iron. Do not put your hand on any of these operations until you see that the limb is suffering from the operation.

From the collection of saffron in the wound
Saffron so makes the veins rigid which are tested on the wound and forbids the dressing from moving, and must leave the wound for a long time
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning to consider if there is much saffron in the wound and if there is no other illness besides saffron, then collect that saffron
And you command the patient to place their head on the belly if they are able, and then suspend those veins with an ounce or two as you deem appropriate; and let that ounce be doubled in this way:
or so two ounces gradually in a body according to this manner
And then gather those veins with fine forceps, with subtlety, and remove the infection an hour at a time until all the veins are relaxed from the wound and relaxed
Remember that you must not touch the wound at the edges of the swelling; and if you are performing the operation in the morning before sunrise, give the wound some sunlight, and if you are firm in your operation do not introduce anything except those veins.
And when you have completed the treatment, then you must instill cold or lukewarm water in the wound so that the acidity which remains from the saffron is corroded.
However if that is not possible for you, then you must cover everything with water that has subsided the pain, and read it for a few days until the pain has subsided and the cautery has healed
And repeat over it as the maid manages until it is healed
And this is the way of the forceps:

About the reduction of the swelling from the nose to the chin
When you have cured the swelling with cautery or acute medicine, and when it has not healed according to the narration, do not be afraid but make an incision over the maturity of the swelling and extract all the moisture that is in it until the bone is revealed
And therefore when the bone is revealed and sometimes in its corruption or blackness, then you must grasp it with a tool of this kind:
And it is called a rough cap, and make it with an awl, and make the head round like this so that it is pierced with a puncture of lime or alum (as it is in the following form).
And place it over the corrupted part of the bone, and then rotate that between the thighs mentioned, and press your small hand gradually until you see that that corruption is gone
And if there is any blood, then restore the limb with drying and astringent causes.
Therefore if the limb is consolidated and there is good flesh in it and the body is excised from the infection and remains for forty days, and is not renewed or apostematized and no accident occurs in it, then you know that it is healed
And if not, then you must only reduce the crack to the shape of the nose, and in this manner: if you discover the bone with iron or acute medicine, and when the bone is revealed, then you take three stripes according to this manner:
The limb is stripped with a triangular iron, and the handle of the iron is extended towards the limb as sometimes done before
And then place that over the bone, and that from the lacrimal; and extend your hand a little from the wound, and then rotate your hand over the stripe until you have pierced all the bone, and that the patient feels no pain so that he knows that the bone is properly treated.
Therefore restore the limb with astringent and drying medicines like those which we have mentioned earlier.
Therefore, when the limb and the area are firmly bound, the material which flowed out previously returns to its place, so that this is more likely to be the cause of the disease.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
When the swelling has subsided.
When the swelling completely disappears and does not recur in the night or diminish, then you must know that the disease has passed away, and that you should continue treatment; and that you should stop the winds blowing in the neck and chest for sacrifice, and give them food and soothing substances such as aloe, enses and ochre, and strengthen the plaster over the swelling with powder.</end_of_turn>
And the manner of the powder is that you take lion's mane cloths four-ply; and use these cloths.</end_of_turn>
And put them on one over the other according to the quantity of which the swelling requires.</end_of_turn And strengthen over those with a hard and strong bandage; and give them rest from the winds blowing for sacrifice; and prevent the winds from blowing and let the swelling rest straight day and night.</end_of_turn
Even if the ligament is softened, it must be kept straight.</end_of_turn>
And prevent the ligament both day and night as we have said.</end_of_turn
And if sometimes the swelling has already subsided, good, and if not, then continue the plaster with the powder and the bandage and the winds until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the beginning of the swelling of the tunica uvea.</end_of_turn
When there is disruption in the tunica uvea, and it is prominent and the eyelashes are pushed out like a barley grain, and the shape is like a house because of this, and if you want to perform an incision, then the operation is as follows: enter the needle at the root of the eyelashes of the lower part and the upper part of the lacrimal; and penetrate with the needle and withdraw the first needle according to its direction; and then insert the needle where the fold of the double fold is, and bring the part of the eye with the fold of the double fold into the circle of the needle, and strengthen that place.</end_of_turn
And then withdraw the needle and place over the swelling infused with album of honey and remove the thread from the wound.</end_of_turn
And take care of the swelling so that it is comforted when the wound is healed.</end_of_turn
And several herbs gathered from all parts around the swelling in a circle of silk within the swelling adjust the great swelling, and when it is perforated with the fine needle that comes from the preon of the swelling, the watery vapor escapes, and the swelling goes down immediately.</end_of_turn
And strengthen until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the care of alconates.</end_of_turn
This disease which is called alconate is nothing other than a wound that is adjusted in the swelling resembling water descending and is not that.</end_of_turn
However, the manner of working on it is that you make the disease subside over the swelling that appears and straighten it, and take the head firmly with your two hands from the two sides and when you see the wound healing in the parts behind, and it does not descend, and keep it dry, the disease will see its causes just as it used to.</end_of_turn
And if it does not descend downwards, you know that it is water.</end_of_turn
However, if it is not prepared with water as we have said, the disease will make the swelling go between your hands and take a pointed cautery and burn over that area above the bone until a little piece of the conjunctiva is separated from the cornea at the edge (within the place where the wound was), until the wound is expelled.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when it is expelled, you distill in the swelling cold water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have already boiled fennel and honey.</end_of_turn
And so treat the other causes until the patient is healed.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.</start_of_turn>
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.</start_of_turn
We have already said the qualities of the water in the division and what is convenient for perforation should be declared according to the situation.</start_of_turn
Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</start_of_turn
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.</start_of_turn
And so treat the other causes until the patient is healed.</start_of_turn
And so treat the other causes until the patient is healed. And so keep the limb of the thumb away from the crown because of the thickness of the ray in the album of the humors of the part of the lacrimal gland, and place a patch on the thumb with butter and roll your hand over it.</start_of_turn
And so penetrate the album of the humors and sit that the thumb has already arrived due to the wound.</start_of_turn
And so measure the palm of the thumb to the preon of the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the black spot, which is the crown of the humors; that you may see that pupil with the vision of the humors for the clarity of the cornea.</start_of_turn
And so keep the thumb inside the area where the humors are, and so put a bandage under another, and thus if the humors descend too much, the hours will remove the pain that was over the which the patient was seeing so much, and the thumb will remain in the humors.</start_of_turn
And so rest a little while; therefore if the humors have descended, the hours will remove that other bandage which was put back because the thumb has not yet healed.</start_of_turn
Therefore when it is dry and does not descend, the hours will extract the thumb easily, and roll your hand a little at a time, and dissolve in the water a little clear salt of gem and with that wash the humors outwards; and then remove the thumb from the coto or stop or bandage with oil and gum and liquid with the humors.</start_of_turn
But these things are of our time and we will pass over them.</start_of_turn
And if you do not obey your thumb at the entrance of the humors because of its toughness — for some men of whom the humors are tough — the hours cover that you take the sponge which is called the sponge of Albert which is the way:
And so perforate in that area, and do not touch your hand in the wound, and do not do so if you do not see that the thumb has gone out through the joint.</start_of_turn
And so remove the thumb as we have said.</start_of_turn
And you must praise them for their work, both when they are prepared for the patient’s sleep descending pain which is in the place where they sleep on the two thighs in a dark house, and when they are prohibited from all movements.</start_of_turn
And rest in the nature of the humors so that it is calm and quiet, and do not touch the thighs either to the right or left side of any kind.</start_of_turn
And let the ligament be according to its custom within the third day.</start_of_turn
And so remove that in that dark chamber and expel the cold sight, and make her see several causes, and then return the ligament within seven days.</start_of_turn
And do not make the water flow in the hour of the treatments or at any other time.</start_of_turn There must be enough water in order that the water may flow with pleasure without great or violent agitation.</start_of_turn
But if the abscess bursts by chance, the hours cover that you remove the thumb on the seventh day, and repair that which was conceded by the water which has escaped.</start_of_turn
The hours restore the sight of the eye and rest on the face of the mouth for which reason they leave them for a while in the dark house.</start_of_turn
And so gradually remove it from that dark place and talk to her about her causes.</start_of_turn
The physician should know that in an emergency it is not excusable for the disciple of vision to leave a few vegetables unpeeled, and that you must remain vigilant during the operation.

There is nothing in the world like the care of swine.</end_of_turn
When there are various animals born in the nose, some cause is found in each of them which is assembled like a scorpion's tail or like a many-headed serpent; and this disease is called polypo which is like that reptile.</end_of_turn And it is a swine that is cancerous, lapping, of yellow color; and it is a swine that is not of yellow color like a lion.</end_of_turn
Therefore, in those lions which are not fraudulent or cancerous, cover that the disease be between your thighs and place it in the sun, uncover its wounds, and prick it once in those lions.</end_of_turn And immediately extract that to the margins of the wound, and immediately inscribe what you have comprehended from those with acute wisdom from the one side until you know that the whole animal is already exhausted; for if there remains any cause of the wound, the hour that you remove it is with one of the subtle instruments with which it is facilitated that no cause remains.</end_of_turn More than anything, if the lord blesses us with salvation or an antidote to the wound, the hour you pause is when you cover it; or if it is of malignant boils, then cover and cauterize that until it is separated from the sacred and when the cavities are all empty.</end_of_turn
And immediately take away the matter from the nose, immediately make the incision wide and open with water or wine.</end_of_turn Moreover, if the nose is opened and humidity proceeds into the palate, the hour you know that it is already healed.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if the humidity does not penetrate as it should, the hour you know that in those pus that are under the nails of the nails to which the incision has not reached, there is no healing.</end_of_turn
Therefore cover that you may believe in it, do not touch it with your hands, and pause for as long as the finger or less, and do the disease and put one limb of the beast into the nails at the root or for another cause which makes it possible.</end_of_turn
And when that is done, that you smell the odor which remains until it reaches the channels of the nails, and that it be expelled over the greasy substance, for it is like the action which the girls do at the school when they play, and it is a light cause of that which you want to make.</end_of_turn
And immediately withdraw the two limbs of the beast, one that goes out through the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and immediately administer lukewarm water to the nails that are in the beast, and do that until you know that the nails of the beast are already at the nails of the beast.</end_of_turn
And immediately extract the beast, and pause in the nose immediately after the separation of the sacred with a bandage, and do that for three days or more until the ulcer is corroded all that remains of the flesh.</end_of_turn
And in the end of the disease, pause in the nose for a plum cannula for five days until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if you neglect the treatment, use that one.</end_of_turn
This is the form of the instrument which captures the maker of the cap, from which are distilled oils and medicines in the nails.</end_of_turn
And do that of silver or of gold, which is like a little lamp with its mouth open, like a little pot, and the meat is similar.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like that of a tube, and the cannula of the capturing instrument of the maker and make it flat, uncovered; to which you shall attach at the back of it that which you have when you take it from the oil or from the things which you want from the juices and from the substances which are subject to it.</end_of_turn
"Chapter XXV
"About the causes of swelling in the extremities of the nose
"Moist and cold humors are the cause of swelling in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and manifested in four days within which it does not decrease in any way
"And for that reason, when you notice the beginning of this swelling, take action immediately, and eradicate all of it "And immediately stop bleeding or cautery or medicine that is appropriate for the location of the swelling
"But if the swelling has been delayed, even if it has become large, consider if it is soft, dark, of a yellowish color and with little sensation, for in that case do not touch that which is around the testicles; for moist humors rise up to that which has caused this swelling because of its great malice towards that which has suffered from it."
"And if the swelling is of a tawny color and does not touch the testicles, and sometimes when the swelling begins, it is possible in all these cases, I evacuate the patient and apply that which is necessary, and care for the area until it is healed.
"Chapter XXVI
"About the suture of the nose, lips, and ear when the continuity is severed by plague or by suppuration
"So, when continuity is severed in one of these cartilages, little confidence is had in that operation except in the case of very noble people
"Therefore, when you must perform any work for some cause of these, consider whether it is fresh plague or old wound, and adjust the two lips of the wound with suture, and care for that until it is healed."
"And if the lips of the wound have already been separated, and some part of the wound is still healthy, care must be taken to remove any surrounding part of the wound until it is healed "And immediately adjust the two lips with suture and strengthen them, and over them sprinkle salt, and cover with lint, and place over the lint a piece of fine plaster, or another similar plaster, and leave it on for two days or three, and then remove the plaster and renew the dressing until the wound is healed.
"The manner of stitching is that you add the continuity of the wound or with needles just as we have recommended in the stitching of the belly, or you add the continuity of the wound with a thread just as you do with us and make known."

"About the reason for teeth that are loose with blood
"When in the surface of the teeth of the gums and of the palate and between the gums there are adjusted hard scales, legs, and some of them are black and are harmful citrine or verdigris because the gum has seen corruption and is harmful to the teeth that are loose
Therefore cover that you have made the patient sit between your thighs and hold their head down, and scratch the teeth where the sores appeared and the cause seems like sand until no cause remains, and that is what causes the blackness and the yellowness and the rest that are modified.
If this is the last thing that is in the beginning of the reason, it is not good; and if so, then repeat the reason over those three days until it comes back to the last remaining thing you wanted
And you know that the teeth have needed diverse movements and figures according to how it is prepared for your operation And thus the razor that is at the root of the tooth is different from the razor that is between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of shaving must be prepared by you:
(The text ends abruptly without completing the sentence.)
Extraction of teeth.
Therefore when you have cured the tooth of its pain with all your skill and have performed the entire extraction of it, there is no cause that replaces the loss of it, which is a sublime substance until it is excused in the extraction of it.
May it be covered that when the patient is forced to extract that tooth, you must certify that it is the painful tooth, because many veined pains deceive the patient and cause that he should not extract another tooth, and you should extract that and the pain will cease until the painful and sickly tooth is eradicated, as we have seen in the operation of the barbers
Therefore when you must certify that it is the painful tooth, and you know well, cover that you score on the circumference of the tooth with the spatula in which any virtue is to be found, until it is dissolved from the root of the tooth to the very end, and then remove the matter that is between the toes or with fine forceps from the beginning gradually until it is consumed.
And so hold your hands firmly together for good speaking or stupidity, and hold the head of the patient between the painful toes that you must not touch, and gently extract the tooth according to custom without causing further pain to the patient or the greater pain you do not give
Therefore if it is not forgotten, take one of those instruments and put it outside from all parts so that you facilitate and expedite the extraction from the beginning
But if the tooth is fractured or cracked, cover that you close that crack and strengthen that area with a fine wire so that it is not fractured during the performance of your operation on that area
And cover that you work diligently with sacrifice around the entire circumference of the gum and keep your strength that you do not break that and leave it in its place, and return to the patient for the greater malice that is in the first pain of it.
And keep in mind that you do not do what ignorant barbers do in their arrogance about the extraction of their teeth, since they do not administer what we have recommended; for many veined pains cause greater suffering in great men than small ones, and the causes of these remain unraveled, or some of them, or that you extract that tooth along with some bones of the mandible just as many veined ones have testified
And so the extraction of them should be preceded by washing the mouth with wine cold or wine vinegar with salt.
And if blood flows from the wound to help, just as many veined ones do, then wipe away any amount of blood and sprinkle it over the wound, and if you do not confirm that blood, cauterize it
The shape of the forceps and fine needles that are useful for grasping the tooth at the beginning is of long handle, short handle and thick, in order that they do not bend when working
And so sometimes of thick handle until you have practiced with them, they are not bent, they are short handled
And they are made of Indian iron, descending, and are made of twisted handles, and in the handling of these some teeth enter into each other and are opened by strong constriction, and some of them are shaped like the beak of a heron that has not been named, so that is strong, and they are of great constriction
End of Manuscript
On the extraction of teeth and the extraction of the bones of the fractured mandibles.
When the tooth is fractured and there remains any cause, cover that you pause over the area around the root for a day or two until the tissue is softened; and then apply some ointment or needles that are assembled like the beak of a heron called ciconia or guanta, the shape of the forceps:
The extremities of them are affected by this disease in the same way as lime or almonds.
If you do not obey me on this matter and do not grasp these forceps or handles, then you must lie down upon the root and scratch all the flesh away, and put in the instrument which has no name, for it is a small lever of this kind:
And make the large extremity a little short, and do not be ashamed of it, for it will not be drunk.
Therefore if the root is split, it is good; otherwise, help me with other instruments of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is that of a triangle with the extremities of the foot together, in which there is any thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that of a triangle and of more subtle extremities
And already you have helped with this instrument having two slopes of which this is the form more like the following: And with other instruments which I will enumerate in teeth; for the aid of this instrument which is assembled like a great tooth, and this is the form:
Of the triangular foot with the round or short heel, which is any thickness, and do not be ashamed of it for it will not be drunk
And other things that I must say of the teeth instruments are like the others instruments.
May the artists be learned and skillful in the art, so that they may find for themselves the means according to what they understand of the operation and the various diseases; for these diseases of which the ancients did not say or even name their proper instruments, for the forms of various species.
May the jaw bone or other bones of the mouth be drunk if necessary, or if you put it away, then the weight of the foot should be supported over that place where it is convenient for the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help me with the management of which this is the form:
And let it be of small size in any greatness, and let it be bound or held in the mouth so that it does not escape or run away until the bone is completely split; and then restore the place with convenient medicines as soon as possible.</start_turn>
May the bone be small if necessary; however, reduce that of that which is black and care for that until it is healed.
Chapter XXXII.</start_turn>
Of the care of the teeth eminent over the others.</start_turn
When the teeth are prominent not according to their natural course due to those which have a hooked shape, and especially when they tend towards the knees and towards the venerated toes; therefore you must consider: if a tooth is nothing like the others, and it is not possible to ligate or bandage it, then the root lies there; but if it is not annexed to another tooth, then you must apply this instrument which is like a surgeon's knife, and which is made of Indian steel of the extremity not too acute.</start_turn
And let your incision be with the one in which you are biting that day for the hardness of the tooth, and that it is not as crooked as the others.</start_turn
And if the prominent tooth is exposed to wear, then limate that with a file made of Indian steel of the kind we mentioned before.</start_turn
And let all be of Indian steel, the mark being quite apparent; and let there be from little points as with a file in which needles are useful, in which the tooth is gradually filed day by day with ease, so that no other tooth is crooked or falls out.</start_turn And so line the tooth at the end, and reduce that which is at the root of the tooth socket.</start_turn<end_turn>
And if a part of a tooth is drunk and the tongue is swollen, then you must cover that until the swelling of that part is overcome and equalized, and be filled so that the tongue does not swell or the word does not corrupt.</start_turn

Of the restoration of teeth that have been ground down with gold or silver.</start_turn
When accidents happen to the teeth before concussion and loosening by percussion or extraction, and the pain does not go away with your treatment, then you must know that it is necessary to restore them with gold rather than with silver, because silver becomes green and soon turns black again, while gold never changes.</start_turn
And let the faithful be firm in such subtlety and gentleness according to the quantity that must enter between the teeth; and the way of the incision is that you take hold of the faithful and take twice as much between two healthy teeth, and that you make two incisions at two angles of the faithful between two mucous membranes, or if one or two, until the tissue reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And immediately repeat the tissue inwards of the part from which you began, and strengthen your hand to facilitate and know when it is not mucous
And let your incision be at the root of the teeth that you do not escape.
And immediately cut off the excess of the faithful with forceps or scissors, and add those to every place in the body, and convert those and hide them between the healthy tooth and the mucous membrane, so that it does not cause injury to the tongue And thus lies that which was stretched like a Roman
More if it is slippery or wrinkled, strengthen that or those to the other faithful in such a way at all times
And this is the way of the teeth and the figure of the incision of two healthy teeth and two mucous membranes, as sometimes these are linked:
And when you make that a tooth or two have returned, immediately close any opening in the places mentioned above, and let them recede as we have recommended, and that they remain closed.
Do not do anything except a good craftsman and wise person
All kinds of girls are suitable for any cause of the bones of the ox, and it is useful to them as a tooth, and is stopped in the place where the tooth is lacking, and is strengthened as we have said, and remains and serves with him for a long time

Extraction of the bladder from the two ureters and from that which is nothing in the bladder and from the other appendages.</end_of_turn>
When the bladder is full of urine, the glands which are together with the bladder often become swollen and painful, and are not emptied by two ureters. When you treat them with water as we have said in the division, and it is not healed, then you must consider if the bladder is tough, dark brown in colour, and without feeling, for otherwise do not touch it with iron.</end_of_turn
And if it is of dark brown colour and the reason is great, do not touch it with the iron for the sake of the soul; take away that which is mad in the meantime, and if you cannot draw it out, break it with your hands or it will break by itself.</end_of_turn
And if it is of white colour, radon, and the reason is slight, then it is that it is likely to be a stone.</end_of_turn
And the operation for it is that you consider, before you perform the operation, if the bladder has already rested after the cautery or if it has diminished in any way; and when you have done this, take away the patient's urine from the belly, and open the mouth of the bladder, and the servant shall take hold of the patient's thighs and hold the instrument above the patient's chest.</end_of_turn
And be it of silver or of gold, and be subtle as a coat.</end_of_turn>
Thus when you have promised it to him and he shows you the bladder, and you touch it on the belly, then take hold of the bladder once and leave it in its place, and pull out that which is outside as much as you can.</end_of_turn And as for any other cause of the tunics, and when you have finished with that, close the opening made by the instrument which we have described.</end_of_turn
And as for any other cause of the tunics, and when you have finished with that, close the opening made by the instrument which we have described.</end_of_turn And it is closed with forceps, however the extremities are curved so that the orifice of each of them is in the middle of the other, not sharp, which is of iron without any teeth.</end_of_turn
Or if this instrument is not available, you may use the edge of a sponge which has this shape: And it shall be sharp from one side, not from the other side.</end_of_turn
And having made an incision, make the other according to this manner, and when you have finished the incision, you must keep the patient from bleeding by applying cold water.</end_of_turn
And if there is a flow of urine, keep water of decoction of poppyseed or of marigold close at hand and do the same in regard to the causes which we have mentioned until the flow of urine is restricted, and take care of that which is necessary.</end_of_turn
And many herbs grow in the bladder other than two ureters, and you make an incision according to what you wish and as I have said in the incision of two holes which join together.</end_of_turn
And I have already treated a woman who was suffering from a bladder which was born in her belly, which bladder tended towards a dark brown colour, little sensation, which had already closed the belly of her, and the woman breathed with difficulty, and had been forbidden from eating and drinking for two days, and was close to death if more water had not been given for a day or two.</end_of_turn
And the bladder had already suffered so much that there were two fist-sized wounds between which it was impossible to pass for two fingers.</end_of_turn>
Therefore I cut fistulally and remained holding one of them once, and pulled out the other, and I took out a great part of it, and I closed the hole with my hand, and I held her tongue, and I remained holding the fistula.</end_of_turn
And I gave her a great deal of rest, and she did not urinate except for a little urine.</end_of_turn Therefore the bladder of that woman was completely healed, and she began to drink water again, and to eat, so I did not cease to treat her for that bladder, for a long time, and afterwards another bladder took the place of that, which I treated until it was prolonged.</end_of_turn
Therefore I gave her wine and cauterized her belly, so that there was no more danger; and I went out for a walk and did not know until later that it was the day of the Lord.</end_of_turn
The end.
From the incision of the bladder when it is swollen.</end_of_turn
When the catarrh descends to the heel, and is swollen and prolonged, then it is named perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part large and round, then it is called buba.
When it has been cured with what we have said in the division, and you do not interfere with your treatment, then sometimes the burn already ceases to exist from itself and is subtle; in this case you should consider that which has been added round; and if it is of such length and is bloody, either of a yellowish or blackish color, and is not of a centimeter, then you should fear the infection of the wound, for fear of the disease.
And when you see that according to the manner which I have said of your whiteness and length, that your wound should be made to be bad and swell, and put your tongue out from it like an instrument from which it proceeds and will remain fixed in the new one, then draw that out and prick it with one of the two instruments which are said in the infection of two wounds.
And you should know that you should not prick it except when it is adjusted according to the natural limit of its adhesion, for if you prick it more, you will cause it to swell more.
And concerning the infection, use the thing which we recommended in the infection of two wounds, and cure that until it is healthy.
When the wound is spread by the infection, know that you should use an instrument in the cautery of the wound, for fear; and the manner of the cautery in the wound is nothing but acute water, that is to say, you should press down on the patient’s hand over the wound so that the wound does not swell, and immediately put your tongue out like the instrument which we have mentioned, and take some water which we have mentioned in the head of cautery, and comfort that which causes life, and stop that which does not swell or is subtle, and fill the cavity of the instrument from which this is the shape.
Whether the extent of the cavity in which the medicine is placed is like that of the cavity of a ray’s claw, and stop the instrument with the medicine over the vulva, the patient will lick on the side of the wound so that saliva or mucus from the mouth of that person flows over the medicine, so that it does not descend from any cause over the edge of the wound and that it comes out whole
And you should hold your hand over the medicine and press that down on the uvula for a moment, until it is softened and calmed by the bite of the medicine.
And if you wish, take a sponge and cover that over the limb of the ray, and immerse the sponge in the medicine, and put the ray on the sponge in a tube so that the sponge adheres to that tube, and do that for as many times as you wish until you achieve what you desire from the cautery of the wound, and then remove that which has dried and fallen down about three or four days.
And if you consider that you must repeat the medicine, repeat that, and keep the cautery away from the circumference of the limb of the ray, and modify that which is in the circumference of the medicine, and let it be washed with lukewarm water, and be treated with an ointment, and be protected until it is healed
And this kind of treatment is more harmless than the infection and is longer in time.
Certain ointments are cured with that which is more subtle than cautery and infection, which is cured with fumigation in this manner: take cinnamon, rue, origanum, fennel, Arabic gum, chamomile, broth and similar to those herbs, and mix them all together, or some of them, in a bowl, and pour them on vinegar, and boil; and the vinegar should be covered with a cloth properly, and in the middle of the vinegar should be placed a nail, according to this manner; make it of silver or of iron.
And immerse the limb in the mouth of the wound until the vapor reaches the uvula over the nail, until the uvula is not opaque.
And repeat over that vapor until it is dry, and keep that you do not make this treatment at the beginning of the episode of swelling, for it would be too tight in the swelling, and do not make that you make water, but declare the swelling of the wound.
And if you do not have this instrument, then take a tube and put in the limb of the ray a piece of wool, so that the mouth of the wound is covered, for the wool of the wool prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
This treatment is good for health.

From the extraction of thorns and of that which adheres in the wound and of the other causes.
Cold humors adhere to the sole of the foot, or the heel, or any other cause.
Once you have grasped what is apparent, that is, what you see, then withdraw the tongue from the instrument which has been placed on the foot, so that you may know definitely what is in the sole.
And what is not apparent and is hidden in the sole, that is, if the food has been digested in the stomach, which strengthens the cause which is related to the sole if it is forced out by vomiting; or if it is swallowed with a gulp of water or with some radish or bread; or if it is forced up with a sponge soaked in vinegar, and you bind that firmly with faith, and thus drive out the bad thing which is in the place where the spines are and it is extracted, for then the pain is forgotten.</end_of_turn> Or take an eel and bind it firmly to it, and be faithful, and place it on the table; or take a purse and bind it firmly to the foot and be faithful.</end_of_turn>
If the pain has not been forgotten by those causes which we have mentioned, then use an instrument of lead in this way:
And make it larger than a small bean, and in the middle of it there should be a cavity into which you can put your finger with ease.</end_of_turn>
And put a little elevation on his thigh, and keep your hand away from the groin, so that you do not touch the bone or the heel, or that the doctor puts his hand there.</end_of_turn
However, if the patient has swallowed more, because of his knowledge of the location of the cause and its removal, then pull your hand away from the instrument with your hand, as much as is necessary until it is expelled.</end_of_turn

Of the extraction of the purulent appendix from the sole of the foot.</start_of_turn>
When the pain of the foot is treated with medicines as we have said in the division of the cure, and it does not go away, consider the pain in the sole of the foot from the foot to the ankle, because you have compressed the tongue from the instrument which we recommended.</start_of_turn
Therefore if you sometimes see purulent matter, extract that which is once small or slightly soft decently.</start_of_turn
And if it is not possible for you to extract that, take a curved needle and insert it into the sole of the foot, and place upon the curvature of the needle a burning iron, and do this as many times (until the purulent matter is dead and comes out of the sole) and abstain from giving him any food until the patient has recovered.</start_of_turn
And give him a sponge filled with cold water, and put the mouth of it into that, and wash the mouth with that; and do not swallow anything from that until an hour has passed, because the purulent matter will be as if it never existed.</start_of_turn
However if it has not been expelled by that which we have recommended, then subdue the patient with a clamp or with an instrument which has been recommended for the ligation of the uvula.</start_of_turn
Do thus, so that it falls.</start_of_turn
And another way of performing this operation is to take a bowl in which are burned charcoal and cover the bowl with a cover which has a hole in the middle, and place the pointed instrument in that hole; and when you have kindled the charcoal, withdraw the cover; and put the patient’s mouth over the hole of the needle, and close the patient’s mouth so that the subfumigation is not expelled until you know that the subfumigation has reached the purulent matter, because the purulent matter will fall down.</start_of_turn
And if it does not fall down, then repeat the subfumigation many times, and abstain the patient from drinking, and feed him with salted foods and the like, and do not give him water, and if necessary keep this treatment outside for a certain time.</start_of_turn
And this is the form of the instrument with which purulent matter from the sole of the foot is treated; it is similar to forceps in this way as well as in others, but it has a curve in it.</start_of_turn which is equal to the sole of the foot, and the extremity of it is similar to the beak of a heron, which is hooked, in which it is grasped from five places, so that when it compresses any cause, that does not slip away.</start_of_turn

When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Here comes the first sentence to translate. Do not add any comments.
And so other pains that are in the joints when they are crossed, and that are not matured according to their complement, are like those that are close to the joints, because the pain of the joint comes from the swelling of the parts that are in contact with it, and from the stretching of the ligaments or nerves of that joint, which is a harmful cause of contraction of that limb; or if the swelling is close to a main limb, and if you delay the perforation of it until it is mature, it does no good to the main limb; or if it is close to the buttocks, so perforate it when it is not mature; and do not perforate cruelly, but only that which is close to the buttocks, so that you do not weaken the root of the limb and that it is elongated towards the lower parts of the buttocks, and that there is a fistula, or that it is in the end that it is not healthy. You should know the time of the perforation of the abscess, and that is when it is mature.
And you should know that it is mature when the pain and fever cease, and when the redness and pulse diminish, and the swelling becomes soft, and other signs.
And you should know that you should perforate in the place where the abscess is lowest and where the pus comes from the care of the bulge
And the perforation must be done in relation to the length of the limb or the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the head or the feet, and in the place of the lacerations, of the nerves or arteries; and finally, in all places where there is no reflection; for in those where there is reflection, use the perforation as regards that limb.
When the abscess is close to the bone, the best time is to perforate it only when the digestion of the abscess is confirmed according to the complement, as we have said; for if you perforate it before that, you prolong the pain of the limb and its swelling, and the lips of the limb are hardened and the depth of the abscess is increased
And so other pains that are in the joints when they are crossed, and that are not matured according to their complement, are like those that are close to the joints...
And you should know that you should administer a small perforation, and in large abscesses, great perforation and wide or multiple incisions according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses
And so other pains that are in the joints when they are crossed, and that are not matured according to their complement, are like those that are close to the joints...
And so other pains that are in the joints when they are crossed, and that are not matured according to their complement, are like those that are close to the joints...
And so other pains that are in the joints when they are crossed, and that are not matured according to their complement, are like those that are close to the joints...
And you should know that in those that are not like this like common abscesses, you should perforate the one that is superficial, or only the plane.
And you should know that when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, that you must perforate it and do not hesitate to remove all the pus in that hour; having extracted a part, and then put the abscess back inside the other day, and the next extract a greater part, and so on until it is completely healed.
And you should know that if the patient is of cold temperament, or fevered, or a small child, or an old man in decrepitude, for the animal spirit is resolved with the discharge of the pus, and it will be better for the patient, and you will perform the operation for him
Keep this chapter with great caution, and take care when you perforate these abscesses, because you must remove the plagues and consider whether the plague of the abscess is small, or is a flat section, when you administer which of the two or both of the counter-measures; and if the abscess is large and the incisions of the perforation are many, you should cover that you stop working in any way until they are complete
If in the armpit there is a separation of the brachial artery or it has been crushed in the limb, it is necessary that you immediately complicate it by tying a ligature around the limb above or below the fracture, as when one has carried out transpositions of bones or teeth, because of the humidity; and leave it for three days; then remove it and care for the wound until it is healed.
If during the operation water flows out, immediately administer cold water and vinegar in which to immerse a piece of cloth, and place it over the area where the blood is flowing profusely.
If the bleeding persists, immediately administer support, care, and the powders that I have recommended in this place and in our division.
If it is winter and the area of the wound is sensitive, immediately cover it with flour soaked in wine and oil, and leave it on the area
If it is summer and the area is fleshy, immediately cover it with powdered herbs soaked in water and oil or in wine and oil, and keep it wet until the third day, as we have said, and then remove the dressing and cleanse the wound, administering the care that is necessary until it is healed
And thus is what is necessary for the knowledge of wound care universally, except as we have already said concerning the special treatment of each kind of wound
Chapter 61
Of the excision of wounds which occur in the armpit of the arm.
In the armpit of the arm there are small wounds, and their tissues contain fat that is arranged in a certain way.
And they are full of pus, and from those there comes humidity similar to lime And from those there come substances similar to slime, and soft like lead
And in the excision of all these, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, as you must know the extension of those does not cause harm to the artery.
And the operation for the excision of these is that you grasp them with an instrument of the kind that you see, which is called a hook, until you believe that it contains the source of the pain
For if the source of the pain is humidity, then you must dissect it section by section in a superficial manner according to this manner:
And begin by dissecting from the line of B to the line of G. When the humidity is evacuated, then you will remove that part which contained that humidity, and do not leave any cause of this, for if any remains of the cause remain, it will return again
And immediately immerse the limb in Egyptian unguents, if available, or in water and salt; and fill it with that until the wound has healed, for that is what destroys all that remains of that part
And repeat this procedure on the limb until you are confident that no cause of the wound remains; then care for the wound until it is healed
And if the wound contains fatty nodes, then you must pierce it in this manner: with a saw having the shape of a cross, and take nails between two lips of the incision and extract the fat from all around, and exert your skill in the extraction of the fat that contains it
If your artery is causing you harm, then immediately tell me about it first
Similarly, do the same with the excised and cared for wound; and the excision of a fat wound is lighter because there is little blood and little humidity.
And there are some veins of these wounds which are in the armpit of the arm of old women who have a lot of fat in the armpits; the cause of which is that I have seen no wound in the armpit of an old woman that did not swell up like a stone, rough, white, which could not be drained, and if there is any such thing in this case, cover it up
But in other wounds of the arm, which occur in the armpits of children, and you must take into consideration the roots of the veins, except for this which has been said, for the excision of all these is superficial
And suspend the perforation of those from the lower part upwards so that the body of the pain is relieved in the lower parts
Then take care of those things which are necessary for the care of the patient.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Regarding the excision of scrofulas which happen in the groin.
These veins are seen to swell in the groin, in the ass and in the armpits; and some are also seen to swell in other parts of the body
And those which swell in the groin, and those which are produced between them, and all scrofula of these is due to the loosening of their own tunic, as in the nodes and tumor of the head, as we have recounted
And the species of these scrofulas are veins, some of which are single, and some which contain moisture, and some which are malignant which do not obey treatment
Therefore when you see in the touchment the color of that which is manifested is like the color of cod liver oil, and that it is bad throughout, and that it is not attached to the nerves of the groin, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, and is not a pulse, because you will have incised that which is at the surface of the part from the part beyond the body of the line of G. between the line of B, and scald that throughout, and extend two lips of the cod liver oil towards once, or towards nails if you need them, as we have said in the tumors of the head, and extract that little by little.
And take greater care that the vein or nerve is not injured
And the spittle should not be too acute, that you do not put your hand too close to the wound, or that you frighten the patient, and that you do not touch anything that is not necessary to touch; for if you touch the vein or artery you will prevent your operation, for when you pause in the plague wet with tears or other matters which remain flowing, open the wound and leave that which has rested to rest until the inflammation of the tumor has subsided and the wound has become softened and the patient has become calm When the wound has been closed
Therefore return to your operation until you have completed it
And in this way inquire about the belly and say if there is any other small scrofula, so touch them and remove them
And if it is in the root of the large vein, cover that so that you do not touch that scrofula from its root. Then cover that with a strong fold of cloth and leave that until it falls down by itself spontaneously
And then fill the wound with old cloth which you have already soaked in Egyptian unguents, and take care of that
And if you touch the whole scrofula, then cover that you adjust the two lips of the wound and keep them so tight that no fluid escapes.
If there is sometimes excess fluid due to the greatness of the scrofula, cover that you understand how to touch the root of that, and remove that and administer suture and what is said
And that of the scrofulas which contain moisture, pierce that with a superficial puncture here where you see the mature of them, and stop the puncture of that until the pus comes out from under the belly of the body, as we have said
And administer the puncture, pour water on it in the ointment and remain with it until the wound has healed, so that it does not break the corruption And when the wound has already become soft, then take care of that which is generated in the ointment until it is healed

Concerning the excision of the root of the tumor which is accidental due to the gut.
I say that this excision in the pelvis has not been seen by anyone in our land that it has been successful
This is the inscription of the sermon of those things
And in the women there has not been quenching, cover that the extraction of the pelvis is avoided, as for that it is not of any use to the patient for all the veins and the greater part of the disease are there
May in those who have eaten too much cheese in the mouth or garlic or two walnuts, when the disease is not in the throat, cover him with the section of epilhot to prevent the loss which is caused by perforation.
Therefore cover when you want, that they cut three circles of the circles of the epilhot, or four at a little less than a section for the breadth in those who are between two circles for quantity, that the section be in cartilage, not in the cartilage, and this place is convenient for section, which is private of flesh and the vessels of sanctity are loosened from it
And if the doctor is inexperienced, cover that when he extends the tendon of the heel towards the ankle, and open the tendon until it reaches the canal, but avoid the vessels of sanctity if you see them from any cause.
And immediately cut him according to what we have recommended; and it is significant about the section of the canal for the flame which is from that which comes out with that which is broken and for the evacuation of the voice
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore when the hour is ripe in which perforation is feared, add two layers of the tendon of the wound, and so only will remain the cartilage.
And immediately administer medicines that make the flesh disappear until it is healed.
And say Albucasis that the sum of the words that we have recommended, exposure is nothing but that you see that from these eaten cheeses already the garlic of the disease has gone away, and the disease is overcome within death, and from it the ale is separated, and from these remain to cut into the epiglottis so that the disease can breathe over the place of the wound for any breath, and thus be saved from death.
And thus I command to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease is consumed; and the malice is from it for three days; and therefore I command you to close the wound when it is healed.
And what I have seen for my means is that a servant brought a jug and poured it into the ankle and cut a part of the canal of the lung, and I was called to care for it, and I covered the mucus in the same way as it is done from the dead, and I uncovered the wound and covered the vessel which was sitting from the wound small.
And thus I confessed that no vessel or nerve had been cut, and that it went away from the wound, and it healed within that that was sick
And I did not tell the servant if he did not recover in the voice, and thus after a few days he returned to his work with perfect health
And thus I say that in the section of the epilhot there is no fear

Of section about eaten cheese which happens in the heel outside, and it is called hernia of the heel
This great abscess which is called hernia of the heel is great according to the color of the body, and is not in the legs.
And it is according to two methods, which is either natural or accidental
And in the natural one it is not the work of healing
And the accidental one is according to two methods of which one is like grass knots, and the other method is like a abscess which is caused by the swelling of an artery, and in this one there is fear And do not cover that which makes presumption of it like iron except in that which is small And you shall know that if you find that which is similar to grass knots, and that is not suspended from any vein, then you shall cut that as if it were nodes, and extract that which is within the skin and the fat; and if not, the hour is prescribed to do everything that is necessary, and to care for the place with care until it is healed

Of the section of the species of nodes
Of these there are many species of nodes and I have already said all the species of them in the division
And cover that I recommend to distinguish between a node and an extrusion as makes doubt.
And thus I say that in an extrusion there is fever and pain and great heat until the ebullition of the fluid is calmed; and it is completed by putrefaction that the hour stops the fever, the pain and the heat
May it be known that this is neither a cold nor a feverish nor a painful sensation, but rather that which pertains to the spleen or the sac itself.
It is according to the temperament of the body, and its commencement is like that of a cat, and is made just as when it is full or empty, and there are two species, one of which is fat and contains moisture, and the other is dry and devoid of moisture.
Therefore, when you reach the treatment of the node, expel that which is excessive and inquire about that at the commencement of the pain, which is called the spasm, according as its form will appear in the head which is close to this.
It is the manner of inquiring concerning abscesses and all nodes, that you grasp this pain and bring that which is in the abscess to the most humid place that you find in the abscess, and you will withdraw the strings said to be with that little by little until you know that the pain has already penetrated the cavity
Then finally place your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess, and extract the excess and consider what is left in the cavity.
And if the current moisture, whatever its color, has been expelled, then you will make an incision on the surface according as I have said concerning other abscesses.</start_of_turn>
And if there is no moisture remaining from the intestine, then you will know that it is fat.</start_of_turn>
And dry over it with a section having the shape of a cross according to this shape:</start_of_turn just as you have been taught, and suspend that which is on the nails, and gently remove the cavity from all around, and keep the skin or sac, if possible, over that and extract that pus from the node.</start_of_turn>
But if it is fractured in the operation, it is not possible to extract that pus, and many blood clots adhere to that, and you will extract it piecemeal until there is no longer any cause of the fracture.</start_of_turn>
For if there remains any cause, little or much, the node will return according to the truth.</start_of_turn
And if sometimes there remains a small part, then complete the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and stretch the wound, and place over that which was the abscess, and care for the other treatment until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the node is large, then you will hold the two lips of it and care for that which encloses.</start_of_turn
For if the pulse is contrary to it, or is not pulsating, then you will cover and fill the place with soft wool that is seasoned and smooth that it is old and rusty, and you will keep that strap for two days or three until the wound has healed and the swelling has subsided; and then you will return to incisions that remain of the node.</start_of_turn

And they are said to be caused by black plum stones, which are remembered because for these the fistulas are opened in the cavity from which reflections rise, which are reflected back from their elevation to these reflections.
And there are three kinds, some of which are long, others half, and others short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and the stricture of them

The form of a small scalpel
The limbs of those on which the incision is made are acute, and the others are not acute, and they are not suspended in such a way, but rather because it is useful for the excision of the nodes, for fear of the incision of a vein or nerve, and for those it is healthy for the patient and brings tranquility when the adversion which finds itself in the excision of the abscess is overcome
These are the forms of medicines, and of three kinds: large, middle, and small, like herbs.
They are useful for the ears and resemble the ray with which they are made of alcohol.
And it is in the extremity pierced with a point with covered sponge and in that which runs to the parts inside and outside, when you will, as you see
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers of the hand that does the perforation of the abscesses and are not perceived by the patient, and are of three kinds: large, middle, and small. These are the forms of these things
The forms of winds with which the flow of blood is broken, and of three kinds: large, middle, and small; the forms of them:
They are useful for the ears, round with some length, and are subtle
And that these three kinds of winds must be taken into your great, middle, and small veins, in order that by these they break the flow of blood with speed, and when you first take them you will not find them to be medicine.
In no way should you use it to open wounds throughout the body, but only in fleshy places, such as in the cuts of the legs and buttocks, and in the cuts of the arms, breasts, belly and armpits, remaining like the fleshy cuts humid.
Many physicians consider these instruments and other small instruments that resemble sacks of seeds to be useful; for which the sacred is cut when it is useful for phlebotomy, or incision of a vein or artery.</end_of_turn>

And to anyone who suffers from this, command that he make an incision of the skin with a lunar section according to this shape, from the line of B to the line of G, and remove the entire lump, and replace the wound with a bandage of medicinal ointment, and adjust the two edges of the wound to the suture, and care for the inside that it may be healed.</end_of_turn
More so if the breast leans downwards towards the lower parts and is softened by its size as it happens with women, then cut it into two equal pieces like this, with two lunar sections, of which each contains the other, as the larger line includes the smaller according to this shape of the line B and the line G. And remove the cord that is between the two lips of the wound, and hold back the swelling, and administer what has been said of the suture and the powders that are necessary for the cure until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if you do not comply with the incision of what is necessary to be incised for the discomfort of the patient, and for the flow of blood, then command that you bathe the wound with a poultice soaked in corrosive ointment and leave that which is removed when the fat is dissolved, and care for that which remains until it is healed.</end_of_turn

And do the same with the old cloth, both the outer and inner, and cover it with convenient ointment until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if the apostem of the species of nodes is, and of the scrophulas, then cut over that as well as we have said in the section about the scrophulas equally.</end_of_turn

When an artery is broken, and the cord that is above that is consolidated, then move the instruments that caused the apostem. And it is known that these cause inflammation and apostem either by the artery or the vein: for when the apostem is by the artery, it is long aggregated in the belly of the body; and when it is by the vein, it is near the thighs where it sits.</end_of_turn
And that which is by the vein is round in the belly of the body.</end_of_turn
And concerning the incision of this apostem, it is an error, especially when it is in the armpits, and in the groin, and in the heel, and in many places of the body; and it is not great, therefore command that its treatment with iron should be avoided, and that which is in the extremities, or at the head, should be avoided.</end_of_turn
More so concerning that which is for the inflammation of the orifice of the artery, cut the cord section in the long; and immediately cover the section with a clamp and hold the artery, and remove the tunics until it is discovered.</end_of_turn
And now make a hole over that needle and make that penetrate into the other side, and stretch the thread firmly doubled in two places, — which causes the swelling to subside and extraction of two threads that are in the temples.

And now give care in which poor blood is engendered until the ligaments are loosened; and care for that which is inflamed conveniently until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if there is pus due to a vein being cut, then hold your hand over the area which is near the pus until it is possible to withdraw the pus from the root, and make that penetrate; and stretch that thread firmly doubled until you extract that from the other side, and then ligate the pus with two sutures as I have said before concerning the two parts at the two extremities of the thread.</end_of_turn>
Or if you fear that the thread will be torn, then make a hole with that needle over the whole of the pus from the beginning of the first needle, and strengthen the threads in four places.</end_of_turn
Then dry the pus in the middle of the area where it is, when it is done remove the excess of the cord and leave only what is bound.</end_of_turn
And now rest over the powder which you have soaked in wine and oil, and give the treatment which is suitable for calamine and inflammation until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter of the pus which arises from the twisting of nerves.</end_of_turn>
Thus when pus arises in arteries and veins, and in a similar manner when it arises in nerves when it is caused by their percussion or by excessive handling, and for the like.</end_of_turn
And it is more useful in the places of the assistants or the heel, or in any place where there are painful joints.</end_of_turn
And the pus is dark, it is similar in color to the other parts of the body, and when it is strong it is very harmful, causing fainting in the patient like a stupor.</end_of_turn
And it is not advisable to remove pus from the belly of the body, so leave the cord in place, and it is better to leave it throughout rather than to remove some parts of it from before or after.</end_of_turn
Therefore in those who are in the joints it is not necessary to bathe in iron, because it will strengthen the pain there.</end_of_turn
But that which is in the head or in the front of the neck should be left with space.</end_of_turn And if the pus is little, then you should leave it alone and remove that which is unnecessary.</end>
And if it is great, then you should suspend it with a bandage, and drain that, and then remove that; and suture the wound with sutures, and care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the excision of pus that arises from the heel that arises in the belly.</end_of_turn
Thus the nails of those who are in the belly are seen to be very thick in the veins of those and in the other parts of the body of those who are affected by fungal affections similar to those which are in the fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and already the lips of those are withered, and it is of those which is little, and is of those which is not very large.</end_of_turn
And I have already seen one, and in the belly of it were two ulcers which resembled fungi so much that there was no difference between them and the whites, of slight root.</end_of_turn
And already the lips of those were withered and fell off, and moisture ran from that all the time.</end_of_turn
Therefore I advise you to apply ointment to that in the palm of the foot every day until nightfall.</end_of_turn and the other every day until evening.</end_of_turn
And as for the operation concerning the incision of them, you must consider that if the patient is sweating, and the color of the nails is white, slightly yellowed, you must cauterize with the cautery in the fire because the nails which are to be excised must be expelled without leaving any flesh; and if you leave the flesh, cauterize that.</end_of_turn
If sometimes the patient is pale and fearful, guard yourself from rash judgments; maybe the recent pain has ceased, and strengthen that which remains, for the manner of that is that which we have mentioned; and read that for two days.
And thus adjust in the stricture of the bundle of nerves; therefore, do not cease strengthening the great nerve until it is detached and falls away by itself as work is done.</end_of_turn>
But if it is of great reason, the hour of its initiation is any cause of fear and pain, especially in that which is in the belly.</end_of_turn>
Maybe it is possible that you will dissect the greater part of it, and then cauterize that so that it does not return.</end_of_turn>
And thus care for that until the wound is healed.</end_of_turn>
And guard yourself that you do not presume to dissect that which is of fatty color, of little feeling, of little regard, because that which is absolutely cancerous.</end_of_turn

From the care of eminent physicians of the umbilical cord.
Eminent physicians of the umbilical cord are useful for many causes; or for tears of the sac that is over the belly, and yes of it from them the cloth or the intestine according as it happens in other ruptures; or for healing of which flows from veins or arteries as it is said, or for wind that is restricted in them.</end_of_turn
But if it is for a tear of the sac and for the discharge of the cloth, the hour of the color of the afterbirth is similar to the color of the body; and it is lion that it is painful, and almost appears in various positions.</end_of_turn But if it is for the discharge of the intestine, the hour of its situation is that which we have recounted, of much greater variety, and as you have previously said that which is hidden from us is occult, and almost returns; and it is very painful for it, and it is magnified by a great deal of blood and violent work.</end_of_turn
But if it is for humidity, the hour is lion and is not occult when we put our hand on it, nor is it constricted, nor is it wrinkled.</end_of_turn
And if it is for healing, the hour appears like black spots receding.
But if it is for nothing, the hour is difficult, great and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity.</end_of_turn
But if it is for wind, the hour touches them with lionness.</end_of_turn
And the operation in them is that you consider the hour if the eminence of the umbilical cord is for the healing of veins or arteries, or for wind; the hour forbids that you take care of them, because in that case there is fear and pain just as I have said in the chapter where I said that the afterbirth is for veins and arteries.</end_of_turn
And if the eminence of the umbilical cord is for the intestine or for the cloth, the hour commands the patient to have the belly still, and be sitting extended; and command him to take hold of the umbilical cord around its circumference; and command him to place two hands over the two thighs; and command him to extend the greater part of the afterbirth to the flanks as far as one hand can; and command him to hold the circumference of the umbilical cord firmly or gently and according to the liar's manner.</end_of_turn
And command him to cover the extended part of the afterbirth over the ligament and insert the thumb of your hand in that place and grasp the intestine; and if you have grasped it neither guarded for the ligament, the hour will extract it and expel the intestine from the parts of the belly.</end_of_turn
And if you have grasped the cloth, the hour takes hold of that once; and incisions the excess of it.</end_of_turn
But if it is contrary to your veins or arteries, the hour surrounds that matter, and almost returns to your operation; and takes two needles and puts them in those two strong fields and inserts two needles in the circumference which you have made around the afterbirth in the manner of a cross, which will penetrate; and command you to strengthen the afterbirth in four parts over the needles.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, leave the needles and read the place until the fleshy part extends and falls by itself; or incisions that when it is subtle and falls down, and command you to care for that which covers the wounds until it is healed.</end_of_turn
If the navel is swollen neither from solid matter nor from moisture, then you must uncover the abscess just as we have said and extract the solid or moisture which is in it, and then care for that which covers and consolidates the area.
When the swelling of the navel is neither from solid matter nor from moisture, then you must uncover the abscess just as we have said and extract the solid or moisture which is in it, and then care for that which covers and consolidates the area.
Care of the head.
We have already said in the division what kind of headache we are dealing with and how it should be treated with medicines, and that it is harmful to treat it with iron so that it does not become ulcerated; and we have already said that headaches are caused by various things and the care of them.
And the old doctors say that many headaches are caused by phlegm in the head, and that it is not possible to eradicate them, especially when they are in the breasts or in the womb and when they spread to the limbs, for they take away all that is around them, especially when they are just beginning.
More when it is old and hard, do not try to cure it yourself, for I have never seen it healed by any salve or that anyone else has ever seen, neither that it has been overcome by anything
And the operation for it is when it is allowed as we have said, that you precede it by giving the patient laxatives and purging him of black bile for several days, and then apply the salve, if it is found to be present in excessive quantity
And prepare the patient for the operation in the way in which it is placed for the operation, and prohibit the occurrence of any cuts in the area; and condone thoroughly the area around the navel with wool so that no discomfort remains until the cause of the headache has been removed Leave the patient to rest, and do not touch or move him violently, press the areas, and wipe away the blood with your hand or with any instrument that you have at your disposal
If there is great bleeding from a vein or an artery, then cauterize that immediately until the flow of blood has ceased, and then care for the other symptoms until he is healed
Chapter 45.
Care of hydrophobia.
We have already mentioned in the division the various kinds of hydrophobia caused by water, and their signs, and the care of them with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the kind of headache that is caused by worms alone, and it is not approached with iron like the kind of headaches caused by tumors or by hydrophobia, for these are deadly.
And when you have medicated this kind of hydrophobia caused by tumors with medicines and do not see improvement, then consider that if the patient has already achieved complete recovery from his headache or from another ailment, even if it is in his head or abdomen and similar to the previous ones, do not give him iron, for fear of that.
And if sometimes the patient has excessive vomiting, and it is only this ailment and not another, and is neither young nor old, then the way to operate for it is that you place the patient between your legs, express his abdomen with your hand, fill his stomach with water up to the level of the nipples, and give him lobe of bitter herbs in this way:
both in two sharp parts long, like lobe; however, do this gradually in small doses so that in the operation there is no passage into the intestines, and that you stop when you see that.
And consider if the generation of hydrophobia is from the intestines, for in that case you must remove the navel three inches from the flanks, in the direction of the navel
And if the generation of hydrophobia is from kidney disease, then your incision should be to the left of the navel for three inches
And if the generation is from the spleen, then your incision should be in the flank.
And do not let your incision be over the rib where the patient is vomiting, for fear of breaking the vessels there
And pierce with the instrument the whole circumference, and enter into that incision, and raise your hand with the lobe between the rib and the stomach, and you will see that; if there is the quantity of a nail or two.
And pierce the sac until the lobe reaches the gut, and this is the place of water And thus extract that and insert an instrument of this shape: And it is similar to a silver cannula; it is made of silver or ivory or gold, and at the lower end of it is a small hook, and on the sides of it are three hooks: two from one side and one from the other side; and the handle is sharp as a pen, just like sometimes:
And in the extraction of it is most necessary an armlet, because when the instrument comes into the water, then so much water flows over the instrument that it evacuates a great quantity of water at once; for if you evacuate less than this in an hour, there will be much more pain for the resolution of the spirit animal, or from the fivepi which is proximate to death.
More should be evacuated according to the quantity of the virtue of the instrument and according to what you understand to be the provisions of the patient's virtue and the goodness of his blood.
And thus extract the instrument, and retain the water which causes this, because so much of it is retained by the codena which retains the hook which is over the navel which you must perform according to that manner.
And thus repeat the instrument on another day if the patient tolerates it, and extract a small quantity of water, and make water for a few days for fear, and keep yourself from error until there remains no more water except a little
If you fear about the patient, and you see that the water has become great, then care for that which is buried in fine sand, and mix yourrrh in bath, and to the sun expose for a long time; and care for that which is medicinal drying until it is healed.
And cauterize on the stomach, and the melsa, and press firmly at the extraction of the water, according to what I have recounted in what precedes.
End of treatment.
Concerning the care of children whose urine sacs are not perforated
Some of the girls of these children are like that of their mothers, and the head of their mixture is not perforated (or is slightly torn or not in its place).
Therefore cover loosely so that it is not perforated as much as is born with a little spur of water following this form:
And place on the tear a plum plummet of lead and ligate that, and keep it for three days or for three quarters of a day
And when he wants to urinate, let him urinate freely; and when he has urinated, return that
And if you do not place the lead there, it is possible that the urine that comes over the place will not reach that clamp
But if the tear is slightly torn is to be medicated with a lead clamp, as we have said, for several days until it is strengthened.
But those in which the tear is not in its place, that is to say, that which cause is that the one which is born has the head of the spur pushed up so that it cannot urinate downwards, until it raises the spur with its hand to the parts below; and this is not a vice, for the sperm cannot reach the mother according to custom, and is a bad disease for the woman
And the manner of the operation in them is that the patient is placed over the two hips, and then extend the head of the spur of the bladder with your left hand with great extraction, and pierce the head of the head of the bladder of the place of the navel with a sharp instrument, as if it were written with a pen, or that you remove any part of it, so that the middle of it comes out resembling the head of the bladder and that the tear falls into the middle place as it should cover
And take care that in your operation of flux of urine, which is dangerous, that you do not cause any accident; and pause it when you see it bleeding, and care for the wound until it is healed
End of book.
Concerning the care of the one in whom there are accidents in the prepuce, in the head of the bladder, and of corruption, and blackening, and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the bladder.
Many times these accidents happen in the bladder and are an eminent vice of the flesh
And of these one is malignant and the other is not malignant
Not malignant, because you suspend it with a single pin and evacuate it when it is whole; and put a little ointment of Egyptian unguent over that; and do that until it is healed
If the swelling is malignant, of dark color, then you must administer cautery close to the origin and in proportion.
Even if the swelling is in the prepuce of the great toe, not circumcised, and half of the swelling is inside the prepuce and half outside, it is necessary that you burn the swelling that is inside before it solidifies; and when you have cured that which is inside, that which is outside will also be cured, because when you cure that which is inside, the one which is outside will not be left hanging.
And indeed, these accidents happen in the groin and in the prepuce of the black or corrupt; where it is necessary that you conquer all that is already decayed and that is about to decay or that is already corrupted; and immediately apply over that which is close to that which is well, which is made with fine flour of millet and with fine salt and pepper.
And immediately treat that which is alongside the other treatment until it is healed.
If there is an influx of blood, then administer lunar cautery in this way:
because the healing cautery is in two positions together, that is to say over the blood and over the corruption when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the toe is corrupted and is destroyed in an hour, it is necessary that you insert into the meat of the prepuce a catheter of lead so that the patient can urinate through that.
In the adherence of the prepuce to the head of the toe (and this adherence does not happen except in that of which the prepuce is naturally attached, and over which circumcision is not required; and when adherence happens by corruption or by swelling) it is necessary that you excise with blunt forceps until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the toe is freed throughout.
And if it is difficult to remove them completely, it is necessary that you excise with blunt forceps any cause of the head of the toe and the prepuce, and you will help so that the prepuce, when it is soft, is strongly perforated by its softness itself
And immediately separate between the prepuce and the head of the toe with a thread of silk, which already is wet in the cold water so that they do not adhere to another wound
And immediately treat with wine styptic until it is solidified

Treatment of children and care of what happens to those undergoing circumcision
Circumcision is not a solution to continuity as is the other diseases: however, since it is our operation and our will, and since in children it is to be done properly, it is necessary that we assign in that better operation and way less suffering loss of life.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not say circumcision in any of their free times, because they did not find it in their laws, and it is not but that we have learned by experience, the cause of which is that I have found that the majority of the artificers and barbers use to circumscribe and mutilate with new instruments and with nails; and they use thread for ligature and incision with the nail.
And I myself have already practiced all these methods and I do not find a better mutilation with forceps, with thread and nail than that which is done with nails, for in mutilation as with the nail the cord is more easily expelled, since the cord of the prepuce is doubled over two tunics, and the tension is more left behind, and is strongly forced outwards by another incision and certain pain. And in the mutilation which is useful for almsgiving, and which is digital, which is used by barbers, the incision of the extremity of the member is not followed, because it is strong enough to enter the cavity of it
However in the operation with the nail, it is seen that the force is observed more clearly and corrupts your operation. And the cord of the child is short by nature, and most of the times it does not need mutilation in this way, and I have seen that
Except for the mutilation that is done with forceps and thread and needle, the pain, experiment it with me, because the forceps are of proportional incision, for which reason the acute pain that is expelled is as much as the acute pain that is left; and therefore when you press your hand so proportioned there are two acute pains, and I incision according to a comparison in a time; and it is useful to compress the thread with a figure containing the cord of the toe from all sides, to which there is no risk of any error of any kind
The first method of the operation is that you make the child groan if he is one of the small ones, do not do anything else but simply tie the thread in his toe alone, and keep him under observation for that day.
And so do that which is agreeable in all that manner which is within your power, that is to say that which you can receive with your intelligence. And thus do that which is agreeable in all that manner which is within your power, and do not be senseless; and hide the forceps in your hand or let them rest upon the foot, so that the child does not see them or any other instruments.</end_of_turn>
And thus do that which is agreeable in all that manner which is within your power, and bring your hand to the groin and blow in the belly, and pull out that which is inside until the head of the groin is ejected, and then soften that which is added to it from behind.</end_of_turn
The way of the forceps to be softened, this is the way:
Let the one be blunt at the tip and the other be sharp, so that it does not hurt the nail, and let the length of the two acute angles be as long as the length of two thumbs equal.</end_of_turn>
Better an error in softening is that the intrinsic cord of the groin should be left whole, or a part of it should be left from the incision.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must extend that from your hand towards your nail before the apostema of the limb and that you make that according to equality.</end_of_turn
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, the hour extract that from the flesh and insert it there.</end_of_turn>
Better if three days have passed, and the groin remains swollen, the hour you will read that which has entered until the apostem of the burn is cede, and extract that with ease, and insert that which is prepared for you.</end_of_turn
And guard yourself from the head of the groin, for it will not go with it.</end_of_turn
And therefore care for that which is concerning that the plague consolidates from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise of powders.</end_of_turn
And if it is said of the groin to be measured, and you obey those things, then you will not notice it.</end_of_turn
And better care for that which we have said until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the care of retained urine in the bladder.</end_of_turn
Retention of urine in the bladder is useful for full bladder pain due to gravel or for gangrene with congealing, or for weakness or for wound, and it is like those things which we have said concerning the methods of care in the division.</end_of_turn
And if it is not dissolved with that which we have said, it is useful to know the cause of the patient, the hour you must administer extraction from him with an instrument which is called a siringue, which is like this: of silver or of hammered gold, just like a pen with a needle having a round head like a palm and a half, to which be put a tube transparent in the head.
And the manner of extracting the urine for that is that you take the faithful doubled and tie in the limb of the needle or knot for good ligation; and insert the limbs of the faithful into the part beyond the syringe, and insert into the holes if there is any cause of the knot, more than insert into the needle with force. And so increase the syringe with border and with an egg of humors.</end_of_turn
And make the patient cough violently over the pelvis, and embroil the testicles with a rough cloth, and olive oil and vinegar.
And immediately put the tongue into the throat to facilitate the descent of the epiglottis; and bend the epiglottis downwards to the level of the embolus; and grasp the tongue with your thumb and index finger; and grasp that with the thumb and index finger of the other hand, so that the patient may be relieved of the pain without further injury, for this is not good in this case, but rather in the part where the torment originates
And gradually loosen the thread with the small loop, so that the urine flows from the loop.
Then extract that and make urine, and use the tongue, do not desist from using the tongue, and use the tongue until the bladder is evacuated and the patient experiences relief of pain
End of treatise.
What is the quality of the cleansing of the bladder with a clamp and the like instruments that are suitable for this purpose?
When ulcers or abscesses occur in the bladder, or it is swollen with blood clots, and if it is necessary to evacuate urine, then it is permitted to use the clamp, which is as follows:
And if the patient is deaf in the extraction of the urine, then it is closed. And there are three incisions: two from one side, thus twice.
At the beginning is liquid, in which is what is enveloped, and according to the quantity that fills that, is its addition. And when any cause is removed from that which is in it, is expelled, and when it is expelled, with water is expelled, and when it is expelled long, as the clamp does in the battles of the sea.
Therefore, when you want to evacuate humors from the bladder, insert the clamp into the humor, and expel that urine which is filled above, because the humor is expelled in the concavity of the clamp
And immediately insert the clamp into the heel according to what we have recommended in the tongue; and grasp the humor with water which grasps, because that humor goes to the bladder as soon as possible, and the patient is relieved of that pain
The shape of the subtle crystallization of the bladder, and that is the following shape:
And it is sufficient for silver or gold, of which the cap which you put on top looks like a small plume, and leave it there without a ligament.
And take the bladder from movement, and stop in that place the humor which you want to crystallize in the bladder, and grasp that between two strong ligatures with a double thread, and scald that humor over the fire
And immediately insert the extremity of the crystallization into the heel
And hold your hand over the bladder with the humor in a descending structure until the patient feels that that humor has already reached the bladder
If the bladder is not present, then take a fist of rags and make a circle of that; and pierce that through its whole circumference; and immediately insert a strong thread through those holes, even if it is twisted; and add the circle again as it is added to the ointment, because you have stopped in that water which you want to expel humors from, and oil and vinegar.
And hold that thread there in the instrument and make that as you have made with the bladder, and express with your hand until the humor reaches the bladder.
End of treatise
On the extraction of stones
We have already said in the division the species of stones and their care with medicines, and the difference between stones generated in the phlegmas and stones generated in the bladder, and we have mentioned those things to you
And we have mentioned the stone in which we do the operation with the hand, and section
The bladder stone properly is that which is fixed in the bladder
And I have narrated that which is the exhibition and abreviation.
Therefore I say that the stone which is generated in the greater bladder mostly appears in children; and concerning its signs is that the urine which is excreted from the bladder is similar to water in its subtlety, and appears in that sand; and the patient has frequent pain in his heel, and limping steps, and is dressed like this; and in that water there is a clot in the bowels of those.
It is laughable that the healing of children in that age group who have reached puberty is difficult; and it is even more difficult to cure the old. More often in the young is it milder because it is between those.
And of that of which the foot is greater and the cure is lighter; and if it is little, it is contrary to that.
Therefore when we arrive at the cure of that, cover at the beginning of that which we must modify so that which modifies the patient's complaint which pulls out all the wound that is in the bowels; for that wound many times seen prevents the infection of the foot from the inquiry of it
And also take hold of the patient's complaint at the thighs and with hands and fingers so that the foot descends to the groin or that it comes out from the place through some wounds
And do that quickly between your hands prepared, and the most of them will leave the cushions of their legs, so that the whole bladder is left to be emptied downwards towards the buttocks
And so do all that is required and all that is necessary.
Therefore if you feel the foot in the space, then you should cover it so much as possible with a section over it.
And if you do not touch it completely, then cover that with oil, saying with the left hand, if the patient is a child, or saying half if it is a young adult complete, and enter that into the buttock And do all that is required of the foot until it is left to rest And gradually bring that little thing towards the belly of the bladder.
And then press on that which you have said, and expel that to the outside of the limb from the place from which you took the section
Command the minister to press the bladder with his hand; and command another minister with his right hand to extend the buttocks outwards, and with his left hand to hold the coccyx which is left behind the buttocks, in the part where the section is made
And so do all that is required of the vomit being incidental to this is the form of it: and split it in it where it is between the buttocks and the buttocks, not in the middle part, towards the left side of the left cushion; and the section be made on that foot and the thumb be said either in the buttocks or in the heel, and make a transverse section, for that the external section be wide and rather narrow according to the quantity that comes out of the foot so that it is possible and not greater, than that which would compress the thumb which is in the heel of the foot because of the section, and that is very painful.
And know that from the foot is every angle and margin, for that its extraction is difficult because of that.
And from that which is like a lion in shape, and is round, and is difficult for it to escape.
Therefore if that is the one which has angles and margins, adjust in the fissure.
And if it is not thus forced, then cover that with your hand, or that you strengthen over that with your hand which is properly stretched over the foot, and do not escape from it; or that you enter with your hand the instrument which is of curvature of the limb.
More if you do not succeed over that, then enlarge a little the wound, and if you see flow of urine, cut that which is bitter treaded.
More if the foot is more than one, then at the beginning you will push your hand to the mouth of the bladder, and approach it; and at the same time push a little bit of liquid; and it will be like that if there were two stones more
And if the foot is a great stone, it is known that you should make a great incision, for that occurs to the patient two evils: or that it stays or that it causes it to discharge urine continuously, because its limb is not consolidated at all
More administer the expulsion of it until it is expelled, or engineer in the fracture of it with the forceps until you extract that in pieces.
Therefore when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with the fat of aloe and with the oil of drago, and strengthen that. And rest upon that bandage soaked in oil and urine, or in oiled rosemary and fragrant water, so that the afterburn of the cautery is softened
Then support the patient on their hips and do not remove the bandage until the third day.
And if the wound has burst, soak the area with water and oil, and then care for it with diaphontine and ipecacanth until it heals.</end_of_turn>
If the plague happens to cause an abscess, adhere and soften it, and if it appears like the abscess has frozen, urine is prohibited (for it is known to cause the escape of the substance from the bladder), therefore extract the said organ from the plague and remove that substance, for if it remains it will cause the bladder to burst and corrupt.</end_of_turn>
Then wash the plague with wine, water and salt, and against all spices, with what will help to heal it until it heals.</end_of_turn>
And cover in all the hours of treatment that you lie down both thighs and adjust the medicines that are placed on the area.</end_of_turn>
And if the stone is small and is in the marrow of the bone, and is fixed in it, and the elimination of urine is prohibited, then care for it with water as I have recommended until it comes out, for it is said that those who are treated for this ailment are accused of causing a miscarriage; and I have already seen that to be the case. Take a needle of iron and this is its shape:
of a triangle extended outwards, acute, fixed in the butt.</end_turn></start_of_turn>
And take faith, and bind that the bone marrow leaves the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.</end_turn
And extract the iron from the bone with a perforation, facilitating the needle until the needle comes to that stone.</end_turn And move the needle with your hand over that small stone until you have pierced the perforation through to the other side so that the urine can flow freely.</end_turn
Then place your hand over what remains of the stone from the part where the perforation was made, for that is drunk, and is thrown out with the urine, and the patient is healed.</end_turn
And if this treatment does not please you for any cause that prohibits you, then bind one thread to leave the stone, and another thread to remove the stone.</end_turn And place a cautery on the stone in that bone between two bands.</end_turn> And extract that.</start_turn></end_of_turn> And remove the bandage and bandage the wound with ointment, which is useful in the plague.</end_turn
And it is not necessary to bind the thread to leave the stone, but rather to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other thread to remove it, for when the thread is removed alongside the stone, the cord returns to its place and the plague is cured.</end_turn
And for this reason when you remove the thread, elevate the limb above the level of the heart, or that it returns to its place, and cure the plague as we have said.</end_turn>

And the second is that you do not find a bone that is completely sound, since it breaks if you put it into the doctor’s hand when it is hardened, or is one of the bones that has marrow.</start_turn></end_of_turn
The third is that you do not find a bone that is completely healthy, especially the operation with the hand.</start_turn></end_of_turn
And the fourth is that the location of the incision over the stone in the bones is far from the location of the stone, for fear of causing a displacement, and in that there is danger.</start_turn></end_of_turn
And if you need to do it, take a large bone that is completely sound, and little is found.</start_turn></end_of_turn
And if you do not have that, take a large bone that is soft, or present a matrona bone that is fractured in the body of the bones, or a bone that in this art has already lost a part of the art.</start_turn></end_of_turn
Therefore do that present, and command him to do whatever you command him to do from the beginning; for the reason is that he regards if the woman is a virgin, for in that case he must put all that he has said in his arse and wants the stone.
Therefore if you find that, cover that and leave him saying that, and command him to insert it on that.
May be if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert what was said into the belly of the patient and over the stone, because she puts her left hand over the bladder and grasp that well.
Therefore if you find that, then command gradually to pull that out from the orifice of the bladder to the parts below until it reaches that at the rate of the cushion.
And thus insert upon that the suspicion of the greatness of the belly must reach the rate of the cushion of whatever part is at that place and hold the stone in that part, so that his word is not deceived by the stone remaining in their bowels.
And the section should be small at the beginning; and then introduce the ray upon that section, and if you feel the stone, then adjust in the section according to the quantity that you know the stone will be generated from that.
And you know that the species of stone are flecks: some are few and large, and lion and asp, long and round, and haven ramp.
Therefore you know what species are of them for what you sign about what you wish.
And if you see discharge of blood, adjust in the old wound treated and hold it for an hour until the blood has ceased to flow, and then return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
And make that you prepare your instruments as those which are said in the extraction of the stone in men, so that you are helped by them in your operation
And if you see discharge of blood, and you know that the discharge of blood is from the bladder that is inserted, then you must pause powder upon the place and open that which is powdered and stricture descended, and do not proceed further; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for it will strengthen the belly. And take care of the wound.
Therefore when the urgency of the blood has ceased, and the place has become soft, then you return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
Chapter lxii.
Of the section about hernia of the bladder.
Urinary hernia is nothing but the accumulation of humidity in the white sac which is left the codena of the genetia containing the urine, and is called a cystocele.
And some women have it in their own natural cavity which nature has prepared for them in the part of the urine, until it is known that there is already another urine; and it is the codena of the genetia between the white sac which we have said, and it is not water but pus
And the generation of this hernia is for excessive pressure which happens to the genetia, because at those some of this material is infiltrated; and some women suffer from it because of a painful blow given on the genetia
And this humidity has various colors, for its color may be yellow or citrine or bloody, or orange, or black feculent, or white liquid, and the latter is the best.
And the signs by which it is known that this accumulation of water is in the white sac which we have said, are that when it is extracted it is redon declining a little in length like a figure of urine, and appears the genetia, for the humidity contains that throughout
And if the humidity is in the own cavity, then when it is extracted it is redon at the part of the urine and by this it is estimated that there is already another urine
And if the humidity is between the codena of the genetia and the white sac, then it must be left behind
And as for the knowledge of the color of the humidity, then you should describe the color of the humidity in the extraction along with the substance from which the form is preceded; and according to what is left in the remnants, judge of what is contained in it
Therefore when we come to the care of it, we must command the patient to be flexible if it is possible, and sometimes to lie down completely
And thus rest upon the seat of two persons for any reason a little higher, and pause leaving them unmoving.
And thus set your hand on the left side of them, and command the minister to follow the right side of them, who extends his thumb beyond two fingers to the groin and to the part below the navel
And thus take hold of a spanner and split the groin of the limb from the middle towards the heel to the length of the fifth finger.
And thus make the incision according to the rule at an equal distance from the line which should mark the skin of the thighs, until it reaches the white fat encompassing
And thus extract that, and observe, and keep me informed that you do not perforate that; and your excision is like the one from which you extracted, just as if it were suspended with the greater vessels and written on the excision according to the quantity at your disposal
And thus perforate the fatty tissue full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water
And thus separate between two layers of the incision with nails, and stretch the fat to the edges; and do not touch the groin of the thighs encompassing, and perforate the fat in that manner that is at your disposal And thus perforate that in its entirety or in pieces, and more especially the large veins superficially, because if you do not carefully observe the incision of them, it is not worth the security that the water does not return
But if the water proceeds from that outside of its cavity in the hour of your operation, when you have completed the incision of the fat, return that back, and adjust the two layers of the groin of the thighs with sutures, and care for that as for the other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the water corrupted by another disease, when you have recognized that the blood vessels which are their supporters are sore, extract the water, and care for that as we have said before
But if the water is gathered in two equal parts, it is known that there are hernias; therefore perforate that part as you have done with the other equally; and if it is your opinion that it is an operation, then do it
And thus dry the wound, and enter into the incisions with fine silk soaked in olive oil or in scented oil; and pause for a while another piece of silk which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread that over two thighs and the belly; and pause uncovering cloths doubled and powder, and tie those over as follows:
and thus take two cloths and fill them with twisted thread according to this pattern; and secure the extremities with which it is accustomed to knot or with wet thread, and add them to the structure at the groin of the thighs, and one of the extremities in front of the heel enters into the two, and the second front to the part below the navel, and two extremities over two thighs and two extremities on two ankles, and all the tightening is adjusted at the groin of the thighs.
And thus this hernia is medicated artificially with cautery in place of incision with iron; and it is that you take a pointed cautery fine and that you perforate that with the groin of the thigh, and that you ignite it as we have recommended until the white fat containing the water is discovered, and when you take the cautery in this way: and is assembled in Greek letters.
And thus perforate that fat, and it is ignited until all the moisture is driven out
And thus stretch the fat with nails, and extract with nails, and extract with pointed cautery ignited; and perforate that as you are able until you have drained all of it; and keep me informed that the fire does not touch the water
And you know that this operation is more safe and more long-lasting than an incision.
But if in your practice you find opposition to cautery in the hour of incision or in the hour of cautery, or flux of blood, know that you must care for whatever adversity happens to you for that, with care which you are accustomed to give them as it is said.
But if the disease is slight, and you do not hope for the second operation on account of its horror, know that you must perform the perforation as I have recommended to you; and it is when you are confirmed that indeed this hernia is harmless.
And know that you must place the patient on any elevated surface, and then perforate the abscess in the lower part of them with a spanner, and pause the perforation according to the length of the body.
The opening sentence translates to: "And let the opening be wide enough to allow all the water to drain out."
Then place your hand over the ankle and leave the other two limbs open, so that the water remains inside. And take care that the wound is healed when the plague is finished
More likely is that if an emesis is to be made at that hour, you perforate that [joint] only when a white speck is seen in the orifice of the plague, for it hinders the discharge of the water; therefore if you must break open the plague, do so with a needle or some other instrument from which the water is extracted from the abscesses, or adjust the opening of the plague to a small size
And know that the water returns, and is increased approximately every six months or in early spring; and when it is increased, the joint should be pierced according to that manner, for the patient will then be free of pain for several days

Of the section concerning carbuncular hernia and its treatment.</end_of_turn>
Know that in the section concerning this hernia there is great fear of loss of sensation in the major limbs; for I have seen the diminution of these and their restoration by that means.</end_of_turn
And I recall the operation in this and the signs of the abscesses.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that abscesses arise in the parts where the genetia is composed and is caused by various causes: or by excessive acute moisture which is spread over the genetia, or by percussion.</end_of_turn
The color of the abscess is according to the color of the limb, and is not found without pain, and is a hard abscess.</end_of_turn
And the soft abscess is fluid, of which the color is dark, and is not solid.</end_of_turn
Certain herbs are useful for the swelling of arteries, and for the inflammation of those already perceived, or for the inflammation of veins.</end_of_turn
More likely is that in the case of inflammation of the arteries it is known by the dispersal of the abscess when you press that part towards the thighs mentioned; do not touch that.</end_of_turn
And that which is useful for the inflammation of veins is not dispersed by any cause except for pressure.</end_of_turn
And it is possible that concerning this species it is useful to make an incision and over the others meats; and that you insert the hook of the genetia, and slightly stretch the skin of the parts below, and extract that from the white pulp, and remove the pus from the veins, and ligate them, and insert more pus than you extracted from the entire parts of the limb.</end>
Therefore if the limb is already softened in those meats, then you must extract the pus and insert that.</end_of_turn>
And if there is adherence for any cause of the pulp, or between that which is between the veins, then you must remove all that adherence and insert that by incision.</end_of_turn
More likely is that if there is birth of meat behind the adherence which is from behind, then you must insert all that is of it, and extract the pus just as we have said.</end_of_turn
Therefore when your operation is completed, let the plague be filled with soft wool soaked in olive oil and vinegar; and take care of that as well as the other care that is necessary until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

Of the treatment of hernia that is of the wit.</end_of_turn
It is an abscess covered by any covering resembling a sprout with the softening of the testicles, and it is difficult for the patient to exercise and walk because of the pain.</end_of_turn
And in the treatment of this disease is to be afraid of what precedes the recollection.</end_of_turn
However we must say the operation in this case is fierce from the first.</end_of_turn
I say that you must place the patient upon a high cushion; and slightly stretch the skin of the testicles to the lower parts; and insert the hook of the genetia into the groin with the veins that are proved by the worm; and have those other attendants whom you desire, and extend those with violent extension.</end_of_turn
And thus pierce the abdomen with a sharp lancet through the belly of the veins until the veins are uncovered.
And thus extract from every part as much as you will have said in the extraction of the intestines which are in the temples
And thus leave in those a needle which is firm and double, and tie one at the first place where the wound happened, and the other at the end of them. And thus pierce those in the middle of the limb for a broad incision according to the length of the limb, and extract what is added of the foul and corrupt humors
And thus care for the wound like for the other wounds in which you wish to generate healing so that the veins which would otherwise cause two genitures do not fall off, which is not bad because of that.</start_of_turn>
Maybe if the wound happened to all the veins, it is necessary that the testicles be extracted or that the testicles for that reason be equal to the veins, because they are without any nourishment for the incision of the veins, and that they are established or that they are equal so that they are not useful with those.</start_of_turn>

From the care of an intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is by incision that extends over the extended abdomen from the flanks of the navel of the belly, because by giving way the bulges of that rupture will reach some of the bulges.</start_of_turn
And this rupture is of the peritoneum or of excessive movement of the gut, and these two species happen for various causes: or by percussion, or by vomiting, or by crying, or by elevation of any serious cause, or by adhesion.
And the sign of this, when it is for extension of the peritoneum, is that it happens slowly over a long time, and does not happen immediately, and is accompanied by swelling within the abdomen to such an extent that the peritoneum compresses the gut.</start_of_turn
And the sign of this is when it is for incision of the peritoneum, that at the beginning it causes severe pain immediately; and is accompanied by swelling different from the apparent one leaving the navel prominent, and that is because of the displacement of the gut, and the body of the intestine at the edges of the peritoneum.</start_of_turn
And many physicians forget about the gut the membrane, and call this intestinal hernia external.
And some physicians are faulty with winds, and some physicians run in the gut a wound, and here it is retained, and it is in this that great suffering of the disease consists, and some physicians make it worse by causing severe pain and more so when pressing.</start_of_turn
And in the care of these two diseases it is necessary to fear, for that one must avoid the treatment in that.</start_of_turn
And the method of the operation of that is that you command the patient to reduce the gut with his hand to the depths of its concavity if he obeys your return order, and then you are to envelop him over the navel between your thighs, and elevate the legs of the patient.</start_of_turn
And thus stretch the cord which joins the testicles to the depths, and pierce the cord of the testicles throughout its length; and then fix at two points the edges of the incision as much as you wish to open the incision with those.</start_of_turn
And if it is possible according to the quantity that you are able to do that from that the blood is forgotten.</start_of_turn
And thus extract those bloody clots which are left on the cord of the testicles, until the white tough peritoneum of some part is uncovered.</start_of_turn
Then you will enter the gut as said in that in which the testicles are between the white peritoneum, which is left on the cord of the blood, and between the peritoneum according, and will remove that adhesion which is in the back of the blood.</start_of_turn
And thus hold with the hand the cord of the testicles at the edges, and with the left hand extend the white peritoneum outwards, and elevate the blood towards the incision; and command the minister to extend the blood outwards and you will dissolve the adhesion that is behind with the solution accomplished.</start_of_turn
And seek among the intestines that there be no cause of the gut being covered in the tough white peritoneum.</start_of_turn Maybe if you find it in the belly you will leave it there.</start_of_turn>
And prick at the back of the testicles to cut the part which runs from here to there, so that it runs smoothly just as we have recommended in what we have said before
And give immersed lanolin in oil, and place it on the wound; and give the ligature which we have recommended (and several white plaguas are cauterized, which we have said above in order to prevent the flow of blood, for several plaguas happen to fall away).
Even if the case is delayed, the cold water must be applied, and place it on that which will fall away when it is ready as we have said before.
And take care of the wound like the care of other wounds until it is healed

Of windblown hernia.</start_of_turn>
In this hernia nothing is seen that has been omitted in its care.</start_of_turn
And first say that it is useful just as we have recommended in the hernia that is at hand; that is that you tie the blood vessels near the section above that facilitates them; and dry in the middle area around the wound until the blood vessels fall away.
And take care of the wound as we have said until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Some veins break in the ankles as we have said, and examine the area.</start_of_turn
And do not cause the patient any cause of pain at the knee; and if you cause it, it is little; and return immediately.</start_of_turn
And if it is prolonged, adjust the fracture in the heel until the bone is displaced from the heel; and this is because the heel is stretched, and therefore the bone is softened and the area is swollen and examined.</start_of_turn>
And the care of it is like that which precedes it.</start_of_turn
And several wounds are cured with iron in this manner: the patient sits on the seat of his thighs between your two hands, and dry the area of the rupture of the bones examined with a section for the width according to the quantity of three fingers.</start_of_turn
And immediately strengthen the white bone which is under the testicles until it is revealed.</start_of_turn
And take the thread and place it over the prominent part of the heel, and hold that at the navel.</start_of_turn
And tie the two prominent parts on the extremity of the thread of the heel, and adjust the suture so that one is against the other.</start_of_turn
And pull out the extremity of the thread, and do not puncture the heel from all sides, nor extend the blood, nor any other cause as I will tell you in the care of intestinal hernia.</start_of_turn
And take care of that like the care of wounds, and as you prick the veins, soften that and restore the wound until it is consolidated; for the bone is contracted and is not adjusted the prominence of the rupture.</start_of_turn
And it is better in this place, for it is more likely to be healthy.</start_of_turn

De mollificacio de la codena dels testiculs.
When the testicles' cord is thickened by stagnant humors, the surrounding tissues become softened thereby, and this is regarded as beneficial for them.
When necessary, it is required in the treatment of these cases that the patient be placed in a comfortable position, and that the entire thickened cord be freed from its natural position; and that two fingers be placed at the suture site to hold it in place
And if you wish, in the beginning the excessive swelling of the thickened cord can be reduced with three or four sutures and a firm suture.
Then the sutures are inserted between the sutures; and care must be taken to care for the other wounds until they are healed and the pain has disappeared

Of castration.</start_of_turn>
Wisdom teaches us that castration is forbidden in our laws; however, I recall it from this book. It is not necessary to recall it except for two instances. The first is when the physician is questioned about it; for he must know how to cure it. The second instance is when we must castrate other animals for our benefit, such as horses, pigs, goats, and the like.</start_of_turn>
Therefore I say that castration is useful in two ways: by traction or by incision.</start_of_turn
As for traction, the way of working is to hold the animal in cold water until the testicles become softened and limp and hang down.</start_of_turn And then take hold of those with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to touch.</start_of_turn
And as for castration by incision and section, you must hold the animal and grasp the testicles with your left hand.</start_of_turn
And then tie the ligature and pierce through each hole with a section until two holes protrude.</start_of_turn
And then pierce those which appear to be swollen.</start_of_turn Do not neglect any cause of swelling, but rather the subtle one which is on the vessels.</start_of_turn
This method of castration is better than traction, for traction often leaves some cause of the testicles to cause the beast to desire to bite.</start_of_turn
And take care of the wound until it is healed.</start_of_turn

Of the care of hermaphroditism.</start_of_turn
Hermaphroditism in men is according to two ways: when the space between the testicles becomes filled with fluid in which two testicles appear in which there is a space like a female in which there is a seed.</start_of_turn
And some say that the cause of this is the urine which is in the testicles' cord.</start_of_turn
And in women it is a kind: and it is that the known woman has on her tenth a little like two testicles of a man and a little like a man's testicles.
There are three kinds of care: two of the men and one of the women.</start_of_turn Therefore you must insert those meats adjusted until the mark of that has escaped is expelled, and take care of those with care for the other wounds.</start_of_turn
As for the second kind of men, of which there is urine in the testicles' cord, there is no care or operation in them.</start_of_turn

Of the limping and the prominent thigh in cases of women.</start_of_turn
The strong limping is adjusted for natural causes until it is relaxed and is beneficial to her; and some say that it is increased in many women as much as in men and during coitus.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must take hold of the limping with your hand or with a bandage and insert it.</start_of_turn
And do not hesitate at the beginning of the treatment, especially in the groin, to prevent the flow of infection.
And do not neglect to treat the wound until it has healed completely.</end_of_turn>
A wound is never born in the horror of its mother until it has filled all its parts according to its measure (for thus, too, we call the first pain "acute disease"); therefore we must approach it cautiously as we would approach a wound slowly, and heal it until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

On the treatment of rats.</end_of_turn>
A rat is one whose female does not have a hole (perforation) or has a small hole (tract). It is either natural or accidental.</start_of_turn>
Accidental is when there is an underlying disease which has preceded it, or when it is caused by an injury or for lack of adjustment or for a wound or swelling.</start_of_turn
It is caused in the groin, in the belly, in the flanks, in the buttocks or in the thighs, and it prohibits lying down, standing up and sitting, and it also prohibits menstruation.</start_of_turn
And the knowledge of this disease is useful for the examination of the belly, if the swelling is evident, it is sufficient; but if it is not evident, then you must search for it in the belly or in the flanks.</start_of_turn
But if the swelling is caused by a wound, and if it is in the groin, then you must cut and divide that.</start_of_turn
And you must place your hand over the flanks and over the belly, indicating by this that the most is inflamed.</start_of_turn
And the female should lie on her side, with her thighs extended, and you should extend the flanks with force until that wound is broken and the swelling is opened.</start_of_turn
Then take a sponge and soak it in oil and place it over the area, and hold it there until the area is healed so that the wound does not solidify.</start_of_turn
But if the wound is large and thick, then you must cover it with lard or with a piece of myrtle.</start_of_turn
But if the swelling is for cartilage, then you must suspend it for a while and then cut it.</start_of_turn
And if there are medicines that stop the flow of infection, such as vinegar, saffron and balm, adjust them with vinegar.</start_of_turn
And give a wide needle of lead so that the wound is not solidified too soon.</start_of_turn
And keep it for several days and apply cold compresses.</start_of_turn
And do the other treatments for consolidation until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And many times an injury in the belly does not cause other wounds, and you must treat it according to this method.</start_of_turn But if there is a hernia of the bones, the hernia of the bones which is in the belly is not usually treated in any way.</start_of_turn

On the treatment of hemorrhoids, piles and red swelling that occur in the groin.</start_of_turn
Hemorrhoids are recognized by the veins of the rectum that continue to bleed continuously; and when they are ancient hemorrhoids, they are healed by themselves.</start_of_turn
And I have already said about the varieties of these and their signs, and I will say that those which receive treatment and those which do not receive treatment.</start_of_turn
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and piles when they are in the groin and do not appear to the patient, do not require treatment with iron.</start_of_turn
But those which are in the orifice of the belly about which there is a sensation, are cured.</start_of_turn
And you must put the female in a cold bath and extend the thumbs with the nails or with rough hands, and cut them with the scissors.</start_of_turn
And so sprinkle over those knees the flow of the sacred oil from one of the unscised blisters, thus as with acacia and similar to these.
And so soak the swollen feet for an hour, and then stop them in cold water.</end_of_turn>
And if the flow of the sacred oil persists, then make decoction with vinegar and mustard seeds, barley and honey and similar things.</end_of_turn
And so give barley bread and comfort it with honey and vinegar and make ointment with water over two of them.</end_of_turn>
And if the sacred oil is evacuated, it is well; otherwise, make adhere to two sponges, and to the breasts their sacrifice.</end_of_turn
And so take wine and immerse that in the juice of marjoram or the juice of arnica or the juice of gentian with a little wine and make adhere to the place; and take care of the place until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of the perforation of an abscess that has happened in the heel.</end_of_turn>
Many species of abscesses arise accidentally in the heel, thus as millet and abscesses lapident, ulcerous and carbuncular, infected and eroding, fistulas bloody, hemorrhoids and boils and other abscesses.</end_of_turn And I have already said these diseases and their species and their signs, and their treatment in the division.</end_of_turn
And I say in this treatise of abscess that comes in the heel when it is of the abscesses which accompany healing, and if you wish to know in what manner this operation is made of them.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must consider if the pain of the abscess in the heel begins acutely with percussion and spasm and fever, and sometimes when it relaxes and if you touch over that the feeling, the hour does not suffice for the perforation of it, and take care of that which helps about the maturity until the acute of the accident ceases.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must make the limb cease on a cushion that has two cushions; and recline on the heel two and adjust the swollen feet to the part beyond the belly, and the thighs are spread out, and stop the thighs from the hips down to the ankles, and tie whatever is convenient.</end_of_turn
And so the midwife follows behind the flank and administer the instrument with which the opening of the heel is made, the form of which will come in those causes that will make it necessary.</end_of_turn
And so when you administer this instrument, you must stay with the ray of the heel of the limb, and what comes out of the instrument from the heel should not be more than the ray of the heel and should not wound the patient.</end_of_turn If the instrument is larger than the ray of the heel, then you must sprinkle powder over the surface of the ray of the heel to prevent the insertion of any instrument into the ray of the heel.</end_of_turn
And so you must pause the vertigo that runs in the instrument of the flank as it comes out and that the minister hold the instrument and rotate the vertigo until it is opened up to the opening of the heel.</end_of_turn
And when the exudate comes out, and is touched with the hand and is lion and soft, then you must stop that which must be covered with a bandage.</end_of_turn
And when the healing is evacuated, then you must stop on the wound a swab dipped in olive oil or green oil in which there is any stiffness; and stop the pressure on the incision in the heel.</end_of_turn
And cover the heel and over the wound clean wool soaked in water in which are boiled mallows.</end_of_turn
And take care of the wound for two days until it is healed.</end>
And many times the heel is washed and the wound is rinsed thus with water and honey, and sprinkle with water in which lilies or long-stalked parsley are boiled, and then return to the bandage.</end_of_turn>
And if the wound is hardened in the heel by the treatment, then you must be prohibited from treating it with an instrument, having taken care of that which has been said in the division.</end_of_turn
Capitol .lxxv.
The matron should be taught in what manner they should bribe physicians in case of unnatural figures.
A necessary cause is that the matron should know at the outset the natural figure of childbirth for her patients, for when she sees the woman expressing from her parts and wants to smell her air, and this is done because of what is above her, she makes her vomit from the part itself, and she makes her suffer from the excess of it. But when that part is naturally formed, as it is on the navel, and the second one at that or below or hanging or suspended from the navel.
Therefore when you see these symptoms, it is necessary to compress the belly of the patient so that the embryo comes out gently from the navel, and it is said to be corrected by these superfluous matters with good management.
May it be known that no other part is unnatural and unusable, for when the embryo comes out through the feet and the body comes out before the head and the feet, and the hand or the foot is placed below, or at the heel. Or the head comes out with the hand or at the belly, and it is converted into the navel, and it is like the unnatural figures.
A necessary cause is for the matron to be learned and skillful in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
I have shown you all the figures of these things, and what is the art in these things so that it is significant for what it is and has been from what it comes.
When the fact comes out through the navel for natural evacuation, and that is vehement upon the woman and is useful to her, and sometimes the virtue of the thing is already weakened, then it is necessary to do that which the women have, and to evaporate the shame of them with praise and with fragrant ointment.
And immediately insert the matron between these thighs and make a small incision at that place, or cut off that with her nail so that it runs out what is in her of humidity. And press the belly of the woman until it comes out.
Moreover if she does not come out, it is necessary that the woman be sprinkled with mucus of eggs and mucus of fennel with cinnamon.
And order her, order her to compress her chest and do what is necessary to make her vomit; and to put her mouth and nose under her for an hour, for thus the fetus will be driven out as much as possible.
And if the two parts of the fetus are driven out at the beginning, it is necessary that you reduce them gradually little by little. Moreover if she does not obey the treatment, it is necessary to place the woman on a cushion and lift her legs up, and immediately support the cushion on the ground; and the woman should be supported so that she does not fall from the fall.
And if the things are not done diligently and the fetus dies, it is necessary to cut open the fetus and extract it immediately or bind the corpse to her hand or extract it with an equal measure, for thus that which is driven out will be forgotten
When the fetus comes out through the thighs, it is necessary that you support those who are around it, and immediately make the fetus smaller, and that you grasp that, and that you take hold of a limb of it and extend those little by little.
Moreover when they are inside the thighs, order her to vomit and make her vomit with force, for if God wills it, that which is driven out will be forgotten
And if it is not forgotten in what we have recommended, it is necessary to return the fetus gradually until it pauses in its natural figure, for thus that which is left will be forgotten with delight.
And if it is forbidden in all that we have recommended, it is necessary to take vinegar of alum and gum arabic dissolved, and to strike all over the belly for good bruising, and immediately give the woman wine of courage. And immediately make her vomit in vinegar water, until she comes to her senses.
And when the parts of her feet are softened, it is necessary to apply to her a fumigation of myrtle and stop that for her. And when an hour has passed since the fumigation, order her to lie on a cushion, and make her vomit and stretch her mouth, take away that which is there, and press the lower part of her belly with light pressure, for thus that which is left will be forgotten entirely
Immediately from the foot laterally while one of your thumbs rests. Just as much as you can reduce the hand, even if you cannot reduce that, then raise the heel and let it go down.<end_turn>
If it does not go down, then make the heel rest upon the thigh, and with your thumbs press the parts of the limb violently, and at the same time administer oil which you will have previously recommended and mucilage.<end_turn>
If the swelling is great, then make that which is above rest upon the chest, and at the same time study the reduction of the hand, and grasp the foot according to the natural figure, and make the heel go down and command that it compress itself until it is relaxed.<end_turn><end_turn>
Immediately from the foot over the buttocks expand your thumbs and the surface of the foot is at the level of your major thumb.<end_turn><end_turn><end_turn> When the mistress has the foot and at the same time you rotate that little by little, and this will facilitate it.
When it is as it should be and when it is sufficiently relaxed, and then pause over the heel of the foot where we have recommended oil and mucilage.</start_turn>
And then command them to move little by little, and when you have finished that, make that which is above rest upon a cushion and command that it be inclined towards the outside, and command that it be compressed; and make that which is below go down again.</start_turn The fetus is prepared for exit through the wide opening.</start_turn>
When they are horrified of the great one in this way, consider, and then you must insert your finger into the vagina until it is evacuated of moisture.</start_turn
And if the foot is suspended upon the face and the heel is stiff, then you must insert that of the navel, so that it is not retained and remains.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
And at the same time pull the foot towards the flanks until you pause that which covers it, and command the heel to compress itself several times, and the sirrah will go out immediately with joy, if God wills or no.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
The birth of twins or many feet.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn> The wise ones say that spotted twins are born together, and sometimes four or five are born, which is strange and often does not survive; however, this is not always the cause, for sometimes it is for the will of nature, and not for life.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
And tell them, even if they are multiplied, one after the other, that they are separated by the tip of the cord, distinguish those between the intestines in the navel of each one of those, and each one is delivered just like a foot naturally joyous, and so there are several delivered like this without labor as we have recommended.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn
And if they are difficult at delivery, you must make them with violence until they have reached what we have said of unnatural figures, then you care for them just as we have recommended.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
And if the mistress is cunning and makes what she does with ease and tranquility, and with a delay, and is ingenious according to the whole figure as she has prepared it from the threatening danger to health.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn
Remember that they are formed in the womb from embryos and are aborted.</start_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn
Some women have their periods in a major one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and sometimes ten times. And it is enough for me to verify that a woman does not have her period every six times, and another ten times in total, which causes great pain for measurement of the glorious scholars.</end_of_turn>

It appears that the sentence translates to:
If the affection is great and the swelling is coarsened, break the beak [of the bone] in such a way that the moisture contained in the foot is expelled.
May it not be complicated, nor will it obey these things; however, you must inscribe the affection as much as possible according to your skill
And if there is a belly swelling or water in it, you must pierce that through so that the moisture contained in it escapes
Though the affection be on the soles of the feet, the attraction of the legs is slight and the direction towards the mouth of the mother is slight
Though it is coarsened, break the belly and foot; however, you must extract that which wraps around your hand, and that you break the belly and foot so that the moisture which is in them escapes
Though the other limbs are relaxed and the head is turned towards the left hand; though the mouth of the mother is gaping, insert your hand into the armpit, and grasp the affection there, and pull that affection towards the mouth of the mother; and immediately insert under it one or two nails, and pull them towards that.
And if the mouth of the mother is closed by swelling, do not cause further swelling by applying excessive pressure; it is better to administer an ointment of greasy humors. Administer compresses; and follow the patient with waters that soften and moisten.
If the affection is on the side of the thigh, it is possible to do an agglutination: and administer what we have said about the affection seen in the living person
If this is not possible, pierce in the heel and extract it
And do not leave any cause of discomfort for the second time.
When you have completed your operation, administer what we have said about post-operative care for the swellings that occur from the mother
If there is discharge of pus, discharge in styptic waters and administer the other care
And indeed I have seen a woman in the belly of whom was dead, and I have carried out another pregnancy in the same place, and indeed the other pregnancy is dead. It happens to me sometimes after childbirth in the thigh; and I must break it open when it is full of fluid, and I begin to vomit blood.<end_turn>
And I was called to care for her, and I treated her for a long time, but the plague was not solidified
Then I left her with some strong compresses, and I pulled out a bone, and I did this for several days, and I pulled out another bone; and I was amazed that there was no bone in the belly
And then I thought that they were the bones of the dead fetus.<end_turn>
So I left the plague, and I extracted from her many bones, the woman exists in her thousands, disposed of in this way for a long time, without seeing such a thing before
I did not dare to believe that this was strange, but that in this is science and an assistant to provide care with the hand of the physician.
As for the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.<end_turn>
A way to see that the mother is opened up.
This is the way to grasp the bowels, to which two incisions are made at the extremities of two thighs. However, this incision must be made with more care than of a strictor, and must be made either with a needle or with a pair of pliers or with the head of a boy
And the width of each butt is two fingers and the margin of both is one finger; and the length of each is one palm and a half; and in the middle of two buttes there are two adjustments of that middle butt which have already been bound, the length of which is half a palm and a little, and the width is two fingers, or a little more
These two additional things are introduced into the mother's mouth to keep it open when you rotate the two prescribed emetics.
Another form similar to that of that thick and light pus:
Both the discharge of fat and that of urine, or both according to the resemblance of forceps. May, however, at the end of it there are two additional things which are sometimes added, and the length of these additional things is like a palm, and the width of each is two fingers wide
And when you wish to open the mother, then make her lie down with her feet hanging down, and open what is between her thighs. And bring your hand close to the instrument as if with forceps, according to the quantity that you wish of the appreciation of the mother's mouth so that the meteron does what you wish
The way of vomiting which they call the ancient ones:
The way of pressing with which it is pressed together with the foot:
The way of vomiting with which the head is contained
And it is like forceps to which teeth are set at the end, sometimes, and several hairs are added like this as with forceps according to this form, sometimes, to which teeth are added like teeth of a saw to which is applied and contained. The way of vomiting little:
The way of vomiting like a single horn having a spine:
The way of vomiting like a single horn having two spines:
The way of vomiting having two extremities to which the head is separated:
The way of two spatums wide:
All these instruments are exercises, and when more are multiplied of that kind and are prepared, you must make the artificer, as much for the curiosity of your operation as for the people for its quantity.
And do not do anything with those instruments either here or there, for their necessity is not excusable
Of the extraction of the second one.
When the second one is retained you must encourage it, then command the patient that he should retain the seed, and then make him vomit with condiment, and put your hand over his mouth and over his nose, and if with this it comes out, do not be surprised
And if not, then take an emetic and pierce a hole in the covering with a needle and place it in that herb which opens the mother's mouth, as with camomile and rue and saffron and rue marigold and cassia lignea and balsam and myrrh. All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water in the emetic, and place that on the fire.
And bring close a canula of gutta into the mother's mouth, and keep that inside until the vapor comes to the cavity of the mother
And make him vomit as we have said, and the second one will be expelled with speed.
And if it remains close to this care and is not expelled, then command the mistress to immerse her left hand in olive oil or in buttermilk of almond, and then introduce that into the chin and let her grasp the second one with that, and when that has been found, then take the emetic and extend that little by little, because if it is attached to the belly of the mother, then introduce your hand as we have recommended, and when you have found the second one, extract that little by little following the rule so that the mother does not suffer excessive pain Be careful that it should be changed from the right side to the left side with ease
And if the mouth of the mother is obstructed, as we have recommended the care with vomiting and with emetic of the wave with herbs
And if it is not expelled by all the causes which we have recommended, then you must know that it does not escape from her to the mouth of the mother, and bring that to the attention of the matron; for that will make her endure that for some days and it will be dissolved and will be expelled.
May when the body becomes poor, there is an elevation of bad odor at the head and in the stomach, and this leads to the disease; and therefore we must administer sub-fumiguous and convenient remedies at this time.
Indeed, the ancients already resorted to sub-fumigation with rue and dry figs.</end_of_turn>
The instrument for which the female is sub-fumigated is due to the retention of menses and the second [menstrual flow].</end_of_turn
Whether by seeing or feeling.</end_of_turn>
And let the inner limb be grasped in the groin and the outer limb on the fire, and let the sub-fumigation be performed over the shoulders of the fire.</end_of_turn
And keep that which is within consumed by that sub-fumigation and repeat it again.</end_of_turn
Take care of the buttocks of the unperforated child.</end_of_turn
Move the children away and their buttocks are not perforated, which already suffer from heat and swelling.</end_of_turn> Therefore let the mistress know that we must perforate the said area; and if not, perforate with a sharp needle, and keep guard that it does not touch the nerve.</end_of_turn
Then place over that cloth soaked in wine and oil; and keep the area warm until sensation returns.</end_of_turn
If you fear that it is swollen, pause for a while in the groin a needle to expel the days, and stay until the child can walk.</end_of_turn
And indeed, the swelling of the buttocks occurs for the consolidation of plague or abscess; therefore let that consolidation be allowed to subside, and then care for it with the remedies and salves that we mentioned for care and soothing.</end_of_turn>
Care for the fistulas that arise from the joints.</end_of_turn
The fistulas that arise in the lower parts of the limbs are nodular and bulky, which arise from the buttocks or from the space between the buttocks.</end_of_turn
It is a fistula or swelling.</end_of_turn
When that nodulus is old and softened by the moist white or yellowish pus, and some herbs are applied to these fistulas, some of them penetrate.</end_of_turn
And those that penetrate are known for expelling pus through the opening and for breaking up; and some physicians use the disease of expulsion, and they expel it violently from the fistulas.</end_of_turn
And from these fistulas some herbs penetrate into the bladder, and into the meat of the heel; and some penetrate into the groin and into the armpit.</end_of_turn
And it is known that the penetrating fistula penetrates the buttocks and not the non-penetrating fistula; that is to say, your master has told you that the fistula is in the buttocks, and when you want to remove the pus from the fistula, do so with a needle when it is soft, not when it is tough.</end_of_turn
If it is tough, then enter with a needle of plum or horsehair until you sit on the needle or put your finger on the spot.</end_of_turn
And if you do not sit on any of these things, nor does any cause of egestion or vomit or wind arise, as we have said, then it is certain that it is not penetrating, and you should resort to care.</end_of_turn
And when the fistula penetrates the bladder or into the meat of the heel, then the significance of these is the emission of urine from that place and the prohibition of that until the location is consolidated with medicine.</end_of_turn
And if it penetrates the groin or the bone and causes pain in the circumference, then the sign of it is that the needle has pierced here if it is not tough in the bone, and pain in the circumference of the limb; and that it is softened throughout; and that it is not suitable for this treatment, nor is it consolidated with medicine.</end_of_turn
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure for all, and the cure for these is the work and uselessness of the physicians concerning which they are forbidden.</end_of_turn
And in that which is not penetrating and does not regress, healing with a needle is expected as I have told you, and that which I have already tried.</end_of_turn>
And it is that the disease makes the patient groan between his thighs and raises his legs into his chest, the thighs are inclined towards his belly, and he puts his hand over his belly, or he puts a needle of plum or needle if it is tough in the fistula, until he believes that the needle has passed through.</end_of_turn
If the patient groans around the belly, it is necessary that you enter and grasp his belly with your hand.
If you sit on the hand which you wish to uncover, the hour has come for you to sit between the hand and the loin or hip, for it is certain that this hand is penetrating; and do not work there, for it is not in that place, as we have said.</end_of_turn>
But indeed I say that it is better in this case.</end_of_turn>
And concerning the medicine by which healing is expected in this case, it is that you burn a pointed cautery subtly according to the size of the fistula, as it has been said before, and you insert that burn into the fistula until it reaches around the belly; and then repeat that two or three times until you are certain that all those meats which are adjusted in the fistula have been adjusted.</end_of_turn
And take care that the dressings are wrapped around the edges so that all those meats which have been adjusted are embraced, and take care that the medicine which produces and consolidates the flesh is given, and if it is healed, well and good; but if not, the hour is not healed at any other time by any other treatment.</end_of_turn
And if the hand enters and does not penetrate inside the belly which is in the loin, and between that and the hand which is visibly of flesh or fat, and sometimes the fistula comes out on the surface of the knee, the hour is to dry the knee from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it dry on the hand, and be dry in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the extremity of the hand is, and the hand is thus freed and released.</end_of_turn
And finally keep those meats adjusted in the fistula which are assembled like a bundle of feathers and do not remain from any other cause.</end_of_turn>
Indeed if there is an influx of pus sometimes that comes between you and your operation when you are sidelying those meats, the hour is better that it should be with fire or acute medicine, for the cautery of fire adjusts good doses of matter: so is the adjuction of those meats adjusted and the exclusion of the pus except for the excision of the humors.</end_of_turn
And take care that the dressings are wrapped around the edges or in the cause of tearing until the place gets stiff, and take care that the hour takes care of the wound as it engulfs tough flesh generating and consolidating.</end_of_turn
And these medicines in which there is both stypticism and excision; when the hour is restored, it is already healed and you do not fear repetition.</end_of_turn
Indeed if the fistula has already gone inside the belly of the loin and is elongated from its surface of the body, the hour enters and grasps the hand in the loin and inquire about it.</end_of_turn
And therefore if you hold the hand and between you and it is visibly of fat or flesh, and it is proper for the penetration, the hour is not an operation in it but rather by way of trust and hope.</end_of_turn
Which is the cause that you administer in it in three ways: either you cauterize it as we have said; or you drain it so that you can reach the concavity in order to grasp some of them and the treatment will be more effective; and do not proceed with the incision except that you remove the lactam that contains the belly, and that you order the patient to lie down immediately when the sensation of the illness subsides; or that you lengthen it somewhat and expel that pus which you dry out in the belly, as we have said, or by means of the hand or another acute instrument, and finally you modify those meats adjusted in the incision which are in the excision to which you adhere; and finally urge you to restore the entire wound by means of the incision, and if the purulent discharge has not been consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the loin, and if there is still pus in the wound, you will be glad of the illness.</end_of_turn And sometimes the fistula is finished according to this manner: when you enter your hand into the fistula, and it is in the flank of the loin around the surface of the body at the knee and on the margin of the loin, the hour tries to perforate the extremity, which is as if you were preparing the layers according to this form:
... and you insert your hand with a veil of flesh or around those things; and then insert the hand with the veil in the fistula until you reach the concavity of the belly.</end_of_turn
Indeed if it is penetrating at the margin of the loin you must extract from that hole as soon as possible; and you grasp the hand in the loin; extract the limb from the veil and adjust the two limbs well, and bind each one, and rest for a day or two, and when you feel that the flesh has healed sufficiently, bind well again that which is between two limbs of the veil which contain.
And promptly treat the swelling until it is solidified and healed.
Even if the fistula does not penetrate, nevertheless it must be made to penetrate, in whatever way you are prepared, for it is not to be left in the groin, because that would cause you to inflict damage there unnecessarily; and promptly treat that until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
The way to cut the spinos that cause the fistula: the curvature of which is neither too acute nor too obtuse, so that you do not inflict damage unnecessarily, even as often.</end_of_turn
Suturing of wounds in which the silk runs smoothly from the incision site.</end_of_turn>
Wounds are of two kinds, those that are between the buttocks and resemble charcoal, or those that are like the seeds of barley.</end_of_turn And these are either small or large, and that they heal from these to these parts and downwards, and is one, neither too few nor too many, neither too high nor too low.</end_of_turn
However, those that are outside the buttocks must be treated according to the months of little humidity, from which runs citrine water or a little of salt with continuous color, and according to the color of the wound.</end_of_turn
And the care of that which is inside the wound is that the patient should be given wine to drink and that he should vomit until the wound is healed and the swellings disappear.</end_of_turn Then lie down and suspend one hand or hold these with your nail, and promptly incline these must be cut off.</end_of_turn
However, if the nails are not to be taken out because of the humidity of the air and the softening of these, then take them out with rough or coarse or flaccid wool, and extract them from the tissues with the tweezers, and immediately cut them off. And promptly care for them with the other treatment until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
And if the buttocks do not obey defecation, then order the patient to sit on a small cushion, and let him be bathed in the water that is in the wound, and that he defecate willingly when the patient vomits.</end_of_turn
However, if the wounds are outside the buttocks, the cause of these is slight, and that you take hold of these with your nail, or take hold of them with a bandage, and insert them, and promptly care for them with the water that has been mentioned until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And whoever orders an incision, let him administer suture in this manner: take a strong thread and put it on a needle and immediately extract the wounds to the upper parts, and make that penetrate with the needle at the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the part below the needle, and so longitudinally; and stretch the wound firmly, and immediately tie the thread and extract the needle.</end_of_turn
And do all this, and leave these for one and do not touch them, so that the excess of the healing runs from this.</end_of_turn>
And promptly place over the buttocks a compress soaked in olive oil or in cerate; and place that over the wound and order the patient to rest.</end_of_turn And promptly remove that which is inside the box; and when it is morning, care for these with ointment or another treatment until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And since these are ancient and do not work in this medicine, when you see that these are pointed at the spinos or on your nail, that they are made wet by humors and that the pus that comes out hinders them from solidifying; and promptly care for these until they are solidified.</end_of_turn
And leave these wounds at rest for a more violent reason than at first, until they are healed and are not excoriated; and promptly care for these until they are healed.</end_of_turn
You must know that to encourage, is key, and do not be surprised if you notice redness according to the color of the skin resembling the head of a nail, and that is useful in all the body and especially in the parts below the feet and the buttocks, and because of these pains you must support them.</end_of_turn
And thus it is known that this is the cause of the gout which is in the circuit of the knee, and that it is held by the nails or with an awl, and that it must be eradicated from its root; and for this reason it is cured.
And if you will, cauterize as it is before mentioned in the head of the foot.
More than a wart is a small, rough, round blister on the surface of the body, and streaks of pus come out on the most of the children.</end_of_turn>
And its cure is to extend and press that, or to cut that out with a needle or the tip of a knife inside the box.</end_of_turn> And if you will, cauterize as we have said, with fire or acute medicine.</end_of_turn>
More like a flea is a small, foul-smelling or large blister on the surface of the body running in the groin, and when it is touched it appears like a bite of a flea, and it is harmful around the body.</end_of_turn
And its cure is to take a needle of awl or of hook, and be strong, and press that on the flea inside until it contains it around the circumference of the needle of its bristles; and then pull back your hand with the needle inside until it has penetrated the flea, and place that in the groin of the body, and that you evacuate the flea from its root.</end_of_turn
And if you will, do that with a needle or with a steel in this way:
The tip of the needle should be grasped with dexterity, without perforating, enclosed so that over the thumb the learning of the hand is ablated and the revolution of that.</end_of_turn
And if you will, cauterize the flea as it has been said above in the cauterization of the heel.
As for the instruments that are administered to give comfort.</end_of_turn
Some ointments are useful for comfort of silver or lead or ivory ground or malleated; and some ointments are useful of those small and great instruments according to those which are administered, for whoever is administered in the care of the little children is small; and of those of whom the buttocks are tough or painful, those comforts are small.</end_of_turn
The form of great and little comfort.</end_of_turn
The head of the needle in which the bag is tied is wide according to this manner; and let there be a space between that and the bag as often.</end_of_turn
And the extremity of the limb which is enclosed in the buttock, which is entered behind the thigh, is silent (so it is not opened) more like a lion, behind the heel there are two veins, and on the other side one vein, and the breadth of the vein according to the greatness of the rays is greater; and the greater the ray, the greater the vein.</end_of_turn
And let the bag be in which the medicines of bladder of beast or of sheepskin are placed, and the root of it be a palm.</end_of_turn
And let it be perforated for by two veins as often as it is rotated; and if the space between the veins is the thickness of a finger.</end_of_turn
And thus put into those veins firmly with force of force the thread which is of twelve threads, or about those; and adjust that to that the bag be filled; and when it is placed in it the bag is straight in the head of the comfort between two supports with strong constraint, and cauterize with that which each vein demands: More the quality of cauterizing with that is that you fill the bag with medicine, which is scaly according to the quantity of the patient’s tolerance; and keep that it is not too cold nor too hot.</end_of_turn
And thus the patient is placed lying down on the bed, and the legs are raised up on his chest and place a cushion under them on which already the servants are or a cushion; and anoint the limb with oil or with almond oil or with fennel ointment or with marigold; and then insert that into the buttock with ease, and the minister puts a finger over the bag and expresses that until it is evacuated in the belly all that is in the comfort; and then take away the comfort and the patient takes his legs to the wall.</end_of_turn>
And if the medicine forces that to be repeated, keep that as much as you can; and if you sleep with that for the whole night, it is better in the morning.</end_of_turn
May it be so that even if you criticize him concerning the solution of his illness and his symptoms, the hour you iterate your cautery within him, until he is healed.
And if on the buttocks or the thighs there are wounds or abscesses, then the doctor must be skilled and experienced, like those doctors from whom children learn.</end_of_turn>
Care for the wounds.</end_of_turn>
I have already said concerning the division of the care of wounds that it is proper to do so freely, and I say the same concerning the care of those who are with me and the medicines according to their compliment.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that wounds are varied according to the cause of the wound and the location of the wound.</end_of_turn
And the causes of wounds are various: by fall of stone, or incision of space or rib, or percussion with a blunt object, or by bite, or by arrow, or like these.</end_of_turn
The wounds that are on the limbs of the body are also like the wound which falls on the head, or the collar, or the foot, or the belly, or the genitals, or like those of the members.</end_of_turn
And I recommend the care of some wounds so that you stop that reasoning and regulation concerning the others.</end_of_turn
And I will begin with the simple head wounds, for the memory of the compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is caused by the fall of stone or something similar, and if it has already bled so much alone that it is a great wound and you fear that there may be an abscess, then cover the head with a dressing and apply a cephalic plaster as soon as possible; do not delay this. Extract according to that which is necessary of the infection according to the quantity of the virtue of the plaster, if there is no other prohibitive cause of evacuation, especially if the infection that comes out of the wound is little.</end_of_turn>
And the evacuation of the opposite side of the wounded part; guard the patient from repletion and from food and coarse food.</end_of_turn
Although some cause prohibits it, nevertheless reduce the food and do not approach meat or wine.</end_of_turn
And rest on the wound, if there is an abscess caused by cautery, soak in oil or in wine in which is stipticated.</end_of_turn
Although you are sure of the cautery abscess, nevertheless rest on the wound, if it is recent and the air has not moved the powder which I recommend to remove immediately.</end_of_turn
And if the air has already moved that, rest on an emollient dressing until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Although the wound is great or is caused by incision of space and is similar, and its edges are not adjusted for pupils, adjust those with suture as I recommend for their suture.</end_of_turn
Although the wound is already exposed from the bone and soft parts, and is not retention but a little support, then puncture that and apply medicine to the wound and restore the limb almost in the place of the codena, and command the patient to abstain from eating coarse food: heads and offal and similar things, until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if you find gangrene in the codena and it does not adhere to the bone, then you puncture everything that can be punctured and drain it, and apply treatment to it.</end_of_turn
Although in these wounds there may be an artery or vein from which blood flows out of the wound, and which is not closed by medicine, inquire about the artery, and if you find that it is not pierced, then puncture it with a lancet, or ligate it; and if necessary, as it causes you to do, do not obey what we have said.</end_of_turn
And if these wounds are simple and small, the cause of them is slight; thus if you sprinkle over them this powder, which when solidified will cover them, that will be enough.</end_of_turn
And the manner of the powder is this: take part olive oil, two parts of holy oil, three parts of burnt ochre; mix them all together and grind them, and apply the wound with it, and bind it with good constriction until it sticks to the wound, and coagulate with the oil.</end_of_turn
And thus strengthen that which is loosened from the dust and read that, and do not loosen it while it is still moist, for it is not prescribed from it until it is healed.
And so do it alone with the cautery, when it is not at your present command in the case of wounds and of healing.</end_of_turn>
And thus do this medicine work in large wounds when you consider that it must be stopped over those and that they must be flexible, and only in recent wounds that have healed, which will not have been altered.</end_of_turn
And if they have been altered, and especially when it is in summer, then it is not understood in the position of this powder, rather you must take care of those which we have said, because you must place your hand over those edges which are now engorged with pus, or over those seeds of barley which are in water and honey until they have become soft; and take care of those in the other way until they are healed.</end_of_turn
Moreover if it happens to the fractured bone in the foot, and it is small, then you must extract it with the hand.</end_of_turn>
And I say the care of the fractures of the skull in that which there is poison.</end_of_turn>
Of the wounds of the heel.
Moreover if the wound happens on the heel, there is no difference in treatment between it and the wound of the head when it is simple.</end_of_turn
Moreover if the nerve of the heel is cut or an artery, then if it is a nerve, it is not in its engineering but that it be avoided treatment of it with that which makes violent stypticitation, like zinc or saffron which is old and resembles them because it does not affect the nerves and opposes that.</end_of_turn And do not place your hand over any cause of great heat, for the substance of the nerves is hot and the continuation of them is at the brain, which is the source of all the limbs.</end_of_turn
And if it must be treated with medicines that are light, even as in the case of a wound caused by a washcloth in olive oil or not-olive oil, and throw it away when it has been washed with clean water and the other things that make it dirty according to this manner, and heat it up.</end_of_turn
Moreover if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or ligate its edges, and take care of it with powders until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Moreover if the wound is deep or has happened at the lower part of the foot, then perforate that in the area most depressed.</end_of_turn
Moreover if in the wound an artery has already been cut and blood flow has been achieved, then separate or dry that, or ligate that, or cauterize that if necessary to prevent you from doing it.</end_of_turn
Moreover if the spine of the heel or all of them have already been cut, and the veins of the heel have been preserved, then you adjust the edges of the heel with sutures over the heel bone and do not touch that; remove that and reduce that to its natural figure, and strengthen that by stretching it out, and read that for a few days; and take care of that which is inflamed in which there is stypticitation and excitement until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Moreover if the wound has already perforated the bone in price, then pierce that through, and if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of those that you can; and what is not broken, read that until the wound is healed, and be separate and the discharge of it be alleviated.</end_of_turn
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle on that powder which has been recommended to you.</end_of_turn Moreover if there is a fistula in the wound, then take care of that with the water from which the memory will come soon in the head.
If it is a percussion of the heel or of the ankle, and sometimes of its depth, consider more if there is any air in the wound than the patient has; the doctor must know that the wound is mortal.</end_of_turn
And if it is not of depth and the wound is recent at the beginning of healing, then you must place your hand over it for the first hour and do not strengthen that because it will not be retained in the depth of it and will return to the head and worsen the patient, but rather wait for a while without touching it until it has healed.</end_of_turn
If the patient does not present with the disease at the present time, then rest in the plague area for a while until the humors subside; and make the patient sleep on the plague so that what is in them is discharged.
Even if the plague has passed three days or more, and the patient does not have seizures, muscle spasms, or severe abdominal pain, sometimes other good signs appear; therefore, know that the plague is passing away; and then treat with calamus and other cures until the patient is healed.</end_of_turn>
Even if recovery is delayed, and the wound has already opened, know that it is finally healing; therefore, treat the fistula accordingly.</end_of_turn>
If the plague is due to an incision of space or cartilage, and is simple on the surface of the foot or leg, then treat with sutures if large, or with powder if small.</end_of_turn
Even if inflammation has subsided in the bone, and only the fragments remain, then twist the plague and cover to extract those fragments, if they are separated.</end_of_turn If they are not separated, know that the evacuation of the plague makes the extraction easier.</end_of_turn>
And for other plagues that occur in other parts of the body, their treatment is the same as that which has been said.</end_of_turn
Of the abdominal plagues.</end_of_turn>
The discomfort that occurs in the abdomen is either great, slight, or moderate.</end_of_turn
A slight disruption is easily remedied by other means; but if its reduction is more difficult, if you do not hold the intrusion of the intestines in the area as much as possible, it will open and swell because the contents will be difficult to extract.</end_of_turn
Therefore, the best disruption is moderate, because in this one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, just as it is in the two preceding cases.</end_of_turn
And it is known that the suture of the abdomen is done in four ways, but two sutures are common in other plagues of the body.</end_of_turn
And two other sutures are specific to these other plagues, but they are only specific to the suture of the abdomen.</end_of_turn
I recommend that you make any exposure and declaration.</end_of_turn
Therefore, I say that when the plague is slight and there is no cause of the intestine for that, and it is difficult to reduce it, then it is in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the disruption as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen with cold air.</end>
Therefore, when it is like that, you must cover that part with a cloth which you will wet in lukewarm water alone, or that you will grasp with water squinant, and saffron, and pepper, and cloves until the inflammation is resolved.</end
Many herbs make the water in which it has been steeped useful for stopping bleeding, and it is better than the water alone for resolving the inflammation.</end><end_turn>
Therefore, when the inflammation is resolved, then you must moisten the intestine with water in which the height and malva leaves have been steeped, because by this means the contents of the intestine will be alleviated with little cause.</end><end_turn
Even if the contents of the intestine are evacuated in this way, do not neglect this treatment; for a little with this instrument which has the incisions, there will be bloodstains.</end><end_turn>
The first treatment is better when it is gentle, when it is appropriate and not excessive or laborious.</end><end_turn>
Of the instrument, concerning its shape:</end><end_turn><end_turn>
One part is acute, and the other is not acute, and the handle is narrow, and not as wide as a palm, about as wide as a thumb.</end><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
Therefore, when the plague is amplified and the intestine is outside, know that its reduction must be according to its natural shape, in the proper place, if possible over something, because that is better.</end><end_turn><end_turn><end_turn>
When the disruption is wide and is in the lower part of the belly, then you must place the patient's thighs over the seat two and pause their legs above the seat head; and if it is in the more distant part of the belly, then you must pause their head and their feet above the seat head.
And in the same way, if the disruption is in either of the two parts of the belly, then you must suspend your understanding and your thoughts always in this way so that the part which has the plague is higher than the other
And thus you must administer it in the great plagues and in the small plagues.
And in the small plagues, pause the liquid that you have prepared, and thus make sure that the ministering is between your greatest pains, which has the whole disruption in its hand and adjusts the lips of it, and thus uncover from that to that which may cause the suture to break apart again
This is the common suture technique: to grasp the needle or the needle handle according to the quantity of the wound's breadth; and thus leave the tip of the disruption of the ring finger; and tighten the needle once, or twice as much as you do not believe in the two extremities of the coccyx, at the two extremities of the hip bone which is left by the coccyx, until you have penetrated that part; and you have already added two extremities of the coccyx and two extremities of the hip bone, so that there are four orders in total.
And thus tighten it firmly double in the circuit of the needle, and several threads of two parts together, and thus add the two lips and the wound together by adding downwards; and thus leave the thickness of the finger and fix another needle in that place, and thus link that one firmly as well as the first needle; and do not stop until you have completed the entire contraction of the wound
And whether the needles are fine or coarse, because the fine needles do not pierce the flesh too eagerly; and the coarse ones are difficult to penetrate the coccyx, therefore because of this you must make them move in subtility and coarseness
And do not make the needle stay in two extremities of the coccyx too long, for so the flesh is not pierced too eagerly and the wound is opened before its consolidation.
And do not prolong the suture too much so that the wound is not prohibited from consolidation
And thus puncture the extremities of the needles so that they do not irritate the patient’s wound because they are asleep; and you will pause over the suture while expanding the powder from every part, which has the extremities of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound has already consolidated
These kinds of sutures with needles in cold weather are more convenient in the small plagues, because it involves only one or two needles or around those.
The second suture is more common: and it is that you administer with the suture the four extremities, of the coccyx and two extremities of the hip bone, at the same time, with one needle in which you are faithful enough to enclose the swelling in subtility and coarseness.
And thus when the needle has penetrated these four extremities, reduce the needle of that middle part from which you began, so that the faithful thread retracts slightly so that the pus that has risen from that part is brought down to the wound, so that the suture is as strong as the one that has been made with the cloth which is strong enough.
Pause between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the middle finger
This suture breaks the bones.
And in such a suture I saw cured a a man who was bitten in the belly by a dog which was placed by a wound in a palm, and it was the disruption of the greatest wound of a palm, and it was extracted from between two palms of the belly and was the disruption in the middle of the limb; and when I had reduced that, after the belly had been outside the wound for xxx hours
And the wound was consolidated within fifteen days or around, and it healed; and thus we saw that it was possible to make this kind of suture in this kind of wound.
And other doctors had said that it would not be healed; and by a miracle, behold, it healed without any remedy, for in that place there was neither any other medicine nor any treatment, but I paused over the wound every two days and applied continuous cold with water of honey until it healed
And I say two kinds of sutures which are proper according to the narration of Paraula
And that you begin with the suture of the coccyx, and enter the needle from the proximal part to the distal part.
Therefore, when the needle pierces the heel and in that middle lacerates as directed and in length throughout the body, and leaves the tip of the cautery in the place where the needle was introduced; and penetrate the other extremity with the needle from the base to the point at the other extremity of the limb.
Therefore, when you have made that puncture, then make another perforation further down in that middle extremity of the limb from the base to the point at the other extremity; and leave the tip of the cautery in that place, and penetrate the other extremity from the base to the point at the other extremity of the limb.</end_of_turn>
And thus penetrate also where your previous puncture was made, and with that make the perforation in the cautery at the tip of the limb that is in the part above that which you have pierced.
And thus begin from this middle side and hold that part which is at the tip of the limb that is in the other side, and extract the needle from the heel that you have pierced, and then reduce that in that heel and close the tip of the limb that is in the other side from this tip of the limb; and extract that from the heel which is from their parts.</end_of_turn>
And do this once more and another, and do this once more, until you have cauterized all that is beyond according to that example.</end_of_turn>
And the sum of this method of stitching is that you cauterize with stitching of tissues where you cauterize the skin, so that you cauterize the cautery of the part of the heel, and that you leave that other cautery until it is completed.</end_of_turn>
But the second kind of stitching that we say immediately, which is that of the ladies, and this is in their custom and is recommended, is that you cauterize according to the manner in which many doctors cauterize it, so that you add all parts to their proper part for nature; and place one hand on the other hand and the hand of the limb on the other hand, and that is sufficient according to what you have recommended.</end_of_turn>
Because you have left the needle in the limb at your will from the base to the point, and you have made that perforation at the point, and have left two extremities of the cautery; and then rotate the needle and make that perforation from the base to the point in two extremities of the limb.</end_of_turn
And thus rotate those cushions, and make that perforation in any part from the base to the point in two extremities of the limb above that which are on the side.</end_of_turn
This method of stitching is better than the common lighter suture, and is a suture of which there is precedent.</end_of_turn
This is the speech of the ladies.</end_of_turn>
And I say to you, the belly suture is rectified with two needles, so that you enter with these into any part a thread, and begin with the inward needle of that which you must do, and make that penetrate into the other side according to the suture of those which you cauterize.</end_of_turn
And you know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, the hour of stitching it is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.</end_of_turn
More is required of the physician in the case of a wound than in the case of other wounds.</end_of_turn
The cause of which is that when you touch the wound recently with the hand, that the air changes that, and reduces the swelling and closes that and supports that adequately, the hour you stop over that fleshy powder.</end_of_turn
And if the air has already altered the wound, the hour you stop over that cushion that is with you until it makes the flesh hard and breaks the threads, and becomes consolidated limb and limb; and you take care of that just as you would take care of the care of other wounds until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if you are not present with the medicines, the hour you stop over that enough, for it begins to swell, wrinkle, and change that two veins that you give, just as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you do not give another medicine in vain when the wounds are simple.</end_of_turn
And if you fear that the wound communicates with an injury to the principal limbs, the hour you cover that that you immerse linen wool in quality olive oil, or in sweet oil, and stop that in the circle of the parts that are between the armpits and leave the bands.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in the swollen belly, which causes those threads to break, the hour you crush that with black tape that you have, and especially if the swelling is extended to the belly and is useful to withdraw by penetrating it into the curvature of it.</end_of_turn
The greatest pain comes from the large intestine, while that in the small intestines is less severe.
It is difficult to cure that which is called “gegunu,” because it does not yield to a common remedy like other diseases; and this is because of the great multitude of veins which are in it, and for its great size, and for the subtlety of its structure, and for its proximity to nerves.</end_of_turn>
However, if the cause of the disease is known to be a wound, reduce it according to your custom, as you do with other swellings.</end_of_turn>
However, if it has already passed through the space and is either green or black, then strengthen your hand firmly over the area that is affected by the wound, in order that the blood flow be restored, for in the wound veins and arteries are found.</end_of_turn>
And thus cut through what is another cause of the disease, and suspend two extremities of the hand from the part beyond the wound, in order that there be relief from the attraction of the wound towards the wound itself.
Remember the wounds of the intestine when they happen.</end_turn>
When there is disruption of the intestine and it is slight, it is possible that it will remain contained within the abdominal cavity, so that you may see that which had been placed flat in the belly by percussion is no longer there, since the disease was overcome and a fistula was formed, and the discharge of its matter and wind.</end_turn
And thus we shall follow the treatment of these cases even though we do not expect their complete recovery, for we must abstain from the subtleties until the pain has ceased and the area is consolidated.</end_turn
And when the area is consolidated, time to return concerning the pain that caused this accident in the belly; and do not neglect any other disease that exists in your body, and remain in rest, eating and drinking, and approach with oil and move around in your bed.</end_turn
And indeed some experienced people have said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it is necessary to tie it up in this manner: take a piece of large gauze and adjust the two lips of the wound and place a piece of gauze over the mouth of the wound; and when you press over those and stretch your mouth, the head of the wound will be separated, which adheres and is not dissolved.</end_turn
And thus place another piece of gauze over the first one, and do not stop until you have placed as many pieces of gauze as there are in the whole wound.</end_turn
And thus reduce the wound and close it with the wound; and leave the remaining heads of the wound inside the intestine until the intestine is healed; and do not do anything to the pain.</end_turn
And it is possible that the intestine is bound firmly by a subtle thread which is the cause of the beastly tumor of the intestine; for it is more pointed; take hold of the extremity of these threads of the intestine, and do not tear it away, and bind the extremity of it to the body of the wound, covering it with cloth, and bind that thread with needles and close the wound.
This method of stitching with gauze is nothing other than a way of hope and expectation.</end_turn>
However, if the wound is large and wide, mostly if it is in one of the small intestines, it is not possible to cure it except by subtlety, and not to cure it completely.</end_turn
Care for worms and fistula.</end_turn>
You know that all wounds and abscesses, when they grow old and become ancient, become ulcers, and are not consolidated and always have their arm broken and are not separated, the hour that in any member they are, is universally called fistula and is called that which bursts.</end_turn
And fistula in truth is a foul-smelling, hard, white ulcer, without pain, with which the belly is swollen like a pregnant woman; and for this reason it is called a wound of merit.</end_turn
And it is in such soft humors that it breaks; and when the humidity is removed, it is separated in a few hours.</end_turn And many plants have this humidity, which is sticky, little, great, and subtle.</end_turn
The causes have been shown, their symptoms and their treatment are in the division of medicine.
And so I shall tell you the treatment for fistula, which is useful by means of surgery with the hand
And you know that fistula can occur in all parts of the body; which are fistulas that arise from veins and great arteries, or nerves, or the liver, or the intestine, or the bladder, or the kidneys, or any of the vertebrae, or any of the compound joints because of such composition as that of the hand and foot; and of these it is necessary to have proximity to the main limb and similarity.
And therefore that fistula which is in this manner is one of the diseases of difficult healing, and does not receive cure, and requires work and ignorance.
And if it is any fistula of the depth that does not reach these places that I have said, and you hope and trust in the cure of them, and you wish to learn of them, when you attempt to remove them or burn them, and if the fistula goes according to the rule, ask about that from me.</start_of_turn>
Or if the fistula is crooked, then investigate that which is attempted to do by the subtle hand, for the weight of the body is alleviated and curved should overcome the crookedness.</start_of_turn>
And if the fistula is not accompanied by violent movements, it is not possible for you to know of it by attempting it.</start_of_turn
Therefore glorify the works for their works, for the moisture for which you glorify them goes from the other works and comes out from them.</start_of_turn
And so inquire diligently, according to what manner you are able to know if here is something of nerves or bones, and is the curvature of the fistula long or short, or is it a fistula to which there is associated some movement of the organs and this is over what all of your strength, your prudence, your illness, and the invention of the pain consists, because of your compression with your hand over the area, and similarity of the signs and the accidental causes to the apostema.</start_of_turn
And when you have stood over all of those causes at rest, then go to the treatment with confidence: and that is that you consider whether it is an apparent fistula close to the surface or in the limb, long from the joint, or of the nerve, or of an artery, or of a vein, or of any of the places that I have mentioned to you.</start_of_turn
Then dry the fistula according to what is said in the narration of it, and stay until what is in that filtration and corruption of flesh is gone, and what is born in the orifice of the flesh, or of blood vessels and similarity, and cure that which enters until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Or if the fistula is of great depth, and is according to the rule, then cover that in the preparation as much as your ability allows, and almost remove all of your corrupted flesh; and give warm compresses with acute medicines, and introduce them into the curvature of the fistula, which you have grasped with the hand.</start_of_turn
And do thus with whatever herbs you introduce until the acute medicine has eaten away everything that is rotten in the curvature of the fistula from corruption.</start_of_turn
And then restore that which you have scorched which produces healthy flesh until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Or if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it according to what we have recommended.</start_of_turn
Or if the cause of the fistula is bone and is due to your certificate that, stay dry until you have certified that, if you do not prohibit any cause of vein or nerve or main limb as we have said.</start_of_turn
Or if it is to you discovered and is in it any corruption and blackness, then you should remove that until the corruption is gone; and then cure that which remains until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Or if it is not healed and you have reached your limit as regards the eradication of the corruption; then you know that you have not reached the root of the corruption; and then you discover about it again more diligently and cautiously make the reason for it and the modification of it with the greatest strength of your mind, and then restore that.</start_of_turn
And therefore if it is healed, well; and if not, you know that that corruption is in the profound depth of the body, which has not been overcome, and then you will know that in that you will not achieve anything except to cover it up.</start_of_turn
Or if the corruption is small, or you are able to extract it, then you extract it with fine forceps that are suitable for that.</start_of_turn
If bones are moved, it is exceptionally necessary to extract all of them, and of those do not leave any cause for your strength.
Despite any adversity caused by humors, and at the outset there is no fear or error, it is necessary to cut those ligaments or flesh if they are present here, and to break the bones
Despite the lack of preparation of the bones at your hand, when you pause over the wound what you cause to soften the wound that remains around those bones and flesh, and you leave that inside until what surrounds those bones of flesh and ligaments is evacuated, and keep the wound from solidifying, and constrict the section that you have incised in your operation.
Having said that, if you are afraid, pause over the limb immersed in boiled broth with olive oil, or the limb immersed in Egyptian unguent, or in some of the aforementioned unguents, because when they are softened those ligaments will be separated from the wound, and the bones will be relieved of the traction.
Despite a large bone such as the bone of the thigh or the bone of the hip or resembling those, and what is corrupted of them is only the surface, it is necessary to cauterize only that part behind the wound only after that black spot and corruption have been removed, and then restore the wound.
Despite the great corruption, if the marrow of the bone has already been corrupted, it is necessary to close that and the other hole that has been made to reach the corruption, and the pain will be cured when the corruption has solidified
And I recommend to you that you call a man in his household who can stay beside you and watch over your operation.
For a young man who is about xxx years of age, who has suffered pain in his knee, and from whose parts that is maudlin most of all is about the matter of the body that has entered the knee until the matter has reached the knee, and is a matter of great swelling, and not of external cause.
And so it is extended the time for the error of the doctors until the swelling subsides, and I take away the matter that is moved, and their cure is to be delayed until the wound is healed, and they make incisions in various places from which all the pain and the humors of the body are evacuated.
And so the multitudin of doctors will last for two years, and I am not in that art, until I am called
And I saw the wound of the limb and the matter that runs from there from those orifices for a great distance; and already the color of that man was pale and yellow.
And so I introduced the hook into one of those orifices and reached the hook to the bone
And I saw that they had all come out from all parts of the wound
And so I closed my eyes and cauterized one of those orifices until I saw a piece of the bone break, and I cauterized that corruption, which was already black and rotten; and already a part of the wound had become corrupted before it had penetrated into the marrow
And thus I accomplished what was said to me and prepared from the bone that had been uncovered
And I said that I was not in the bone but that corruption which I had evacuated and treated, and I had already drained it
And so I paused the restoration of the wound with conservative medicine for a long time, and it is not solidified
And I repeated the process and discovered again about the bone as before, and I continued to see corruption in the bone.
And I said that to me appeared from that corruption, and I performed the surgery to make the cure and restoration, and it is not restored
And so I discovered the other ulcer and I did not cease to make small incisions in the bone little by little until I had perforated the restoration of the limb, and it is not restored until I had extracted it from the marrow, and I restored it with medicines, and it is consolidated and healed.
And it is not necessary to repeat the operation of the limb and the incision of the limb, but for the provision of the freulein of the limb and for the scarcity of its tolerance and fear of death, which is in all hours excessive evacuation without any great harm.
And thus is healing throughout, and nothing is like a hard bone; and it is good to have the use of the limb back in the whole body; and it is conserved in its use and does not make it contrary to walking or sleeping in any cause
May be he is prominent in limb of the body already has drawn, that is to say, you take ligament and stretch that at the extremity of that prominence, and command that he extend that at his will; and pause that ligament of wool thicker than the first ligament; and then lay that on the bone that is left of the prominence, and extend the limb so that the bone reaches the parts below, and uncover the bone over the place where you wish to close, that the suture does not burn the bone.
And pause firmly or tightly leave the bone in its place, because when you do that the suture will not be prohibited the cutting that does not split the corrupted bone.
And cover that the suture is made over the corrupted area little by little, because if it is in the cavity of the bone corruption and does not appear in its appearance to the feeling, and force the suture there another time.
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, advance one part continuously with the other, and the corruption is in the middle of the limb or in part of it, when you uncover the bone from all parts; then immediately pause firmly, and immediately suture that which was the first part where the corruption was, until the suture of the other part is completed
And let the suture be according to the place of the corruption a little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is at the joint, prick that corrupted joint, and suture the bones that are continued from the other side.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in their ratio but it is cunning.
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, it is not easy; however, cover that you inquire about the corruption in what manner it appears to you, and open that, and tell me how you wish to manage it, and in whatever way is possible for you, and in case it is rectified for you, when it does not make your vein or nerve worse
Therefore know what is incisions and what saws to incision these bones are not always according to the situation of the bones, and the preparation of those, and the greatness of those, and the fineness and greatness and smallness of those, and the hardness and rarity of those; for that reason you must prepare for every kind of operation the appropriate instrument for that operation
Therefore know that this operation means for you about the kind of instrument from which you will approve; when indeed it is great study and long and with knowledge of the methods of this art, and testimony of the methods of diseases, that the hour you already have for your purpose what is convenient for them from all the ailments of the disease.
And I tell you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you will find as simple as those with which you will proceed at your prohibition which you will experience about the others. Form of suture:
Form of another suture
Form of great another suture
Needle form And the head of this needle according to the form of a star, and the points of it are according to the form of the points of the needle of the staple.
And it does not convene to put together the heads of the joints when they are corrupted, or when the large mouth is wide open
Smaller size of the knife
Broad blade of the knife
Form of another suture properly made: it is made in an arc with its point downward and the thickness of its wire, and its limb is of boys with its point downward. Shape of it
Form of a knife in which there is a concavity:
Form of another subtle knife
Form of another knife with a curved extremity
Form of a small rasp like a tentacle
Form of another smaller incision instrument
Form of another incision; this is like a needle, and the extremity of it is like a knife, and it is exhibited in many places in the ratio of the bones:
Formation of rays that converge in proportion to those that are pierced by bones.
The limb is triangular and acute-angled at the extremity.</end_of_turn>
And it is made of Indian steel, resembling all the causes we have mentioned of razors and scissors and knives.</end_of_turn>
From the incision of the limb and the cutting of the bones.</end_of_turn>
The limbs are supported either by an intrinsic cause or an extrinsic one, or as you have treated that corruption for healing with those medicines and the healing does not relieve it, or sometimes the corruption goes away by itself from the limb without having pierced it with any cause, when you must suspect that corruption within that limb where the pain has ceased, for that the pain escapes by that which is more harmful to the limb.</end_of_turn
And the sign of that to which it befalls, is that the limb is black within that it is healed than when the fire has already consumed it, or that it becomes pale near the blackness as soon as the black has gone out of that limb that surrounds it and engulfs all the body; and therefore I advise you to desist from the incision of that.</end_of_turn
And in the same way if the cause of the corruption is a percussion of some venomous causes such as the scorpion of the sea or the fox or the viper and the like.</end_of_turn
If the corruption or the percussion is in the extremity of the finger, then you must pierce the finger and do not give space for the corruption to go inside the hand.</end_of_turn
And in the same way if you reach the hand, then you must pierce that from the root of the bone, and do not give space for the corruption to go inside until it has consumed the bone of the forearm.</end_of_turn
And if you do not know which one, then you must pierce the limb within the crease at the joint.</end_of_turn
And if another one passes, the corruption, and sometimes the limb itself goes away, then in that case death of the disease is the best; and to administer another cause after another in order to cure is in quantity of virtue.</end_of_turn
And in the same way if the corruption comes from the foot when it comes to the heel, then you must pierce that within one of the nails.</end_of_turn
And if it is on the sole of the foot, then you must pierce the whole foot.</end_of_turn> Maybe if it is inside the nail, then you must pierce the nail at the joint of the nail.</end_of_turn
And if the corruption has already spread over the nail, then in that case there is no other remedy but dismissal, and to let the disease take its course.</end_of_turn
The manner of piercing the limb or cutting it is that you grasp the ligament behind which you wish to pierce, and grasp another ligament over the area; and extend one minister over the parts beyond, and extend another minister over these; and you separate the flesh which is between two ligaments without stretching too much the skin until the whole flesh is discovered; and then pierce or cut.</end_of_turn
And it is necessary that there be no movement of the limb from all parts so that it does not touch the area; and that the disease receive a wound adjusted and aftercare of cautery.</end_of_turn
Maybe if an ointment of salvation comes when working, then you cauterize the area superficially, or stop them for some powders that tighten the salvation; and then you return to your medicine until it is complete.</end_of_turn
And keep the affected limb fixed with a ligament as desired, and care for it until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
I recommend to you that you should send a man to the sick foot of this man, this method that I and you recommend, which is that which is acrid to him like the black in the sick foot is to him like fire to combustion.</end_of_turn
And that corruption is acrid at first in the heel before it affects the whole foot.</end_of_turn
And then that man should prepare himself for himself more than when he receives the cure for the limb with the utmost diligence of him that he suffer from pain and adversity, and he pierce that foot within the joint, and fire heals.</end_of_turn
Long time acrid to him that same medicine in the thumb of the hand indicates.</end_of_turn
And then I saw that it was necessary for me to pierce that superfluity that was placed over the hand of the medicines, to approach the movement of the body; and the superfluity did not rebound and began to go away from the thumb as soon as it began on the hand.</end_of_turn
The patient's hand should be grasped firmly, and I do not wish to perform anything further that could worsen the condition, for I fear that the consequence of such action may be death.
When he awakens, let him be returned to his place and I will depart, having learned that the said man had prepared and grasped his hand entirely, and he is well.</end_of_turn>
I have not narrated this story except to say that it is helpful concerning what has fallen out of this ailment, and that its significance is great and significant in this matter.</end_of_turn>
Take care of the bowels and the quality of the enema as with the physicians.</end_of_turn>
When an abscess occurs in a fleshy limb, the space of the abscess is prolonged until collection of pus has formed, and then it is broken and perforated, and the pus is discharged from it. The limb should be kept still as if it were a vessel, and the surrounding tissue should be supported with fine silk or wool, without causing damage to bones, nerves or ligaments. This is called an incision, and is not named fistula.</end_of_turn
However, if the space is prolonged until corruption spreads to some limb, then it is called fistula and we do not name it.</end_of_turn
The care for it is that we grasp that corden entirely as if it were twisted, and more so when it is subtle and is useful as silk, and comfort that it does not adhere to the area for its corruption.</end_of_turn
However, if you hope that the corden will adhere and that the corruption will not cause further consequence, and if there is swelling in the corden, then you should treat it with an enema.</end_of_turn
And consider the pain, for if it is great, and the limb stinks of fetor, then an Egyptian medicinal oil is to be instilled which is made from olive oil and vinegar and gum resin, taking parts of each equal, and they are placed in a vessel and covered over the fire until the medicinal oil has become soft and reached the consistency of honey.</end_of_turn
And take from it what is necessary and dissolve it with water and honey; and instill it into the limb, strengthen the opening of the limb, and leave the medicine in it for the space of two hours.</end_of_turn
And remove that when it is finished; and do this for several days until the limb is healed and the pain is gone.</end_of_turn
And sometimes vinegar is instilled with water of ashes, when this medicine is not at hand; take the ashes of vitriol, put them on water; and do so until you believe that the limb is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the water of ashes, then instill an enema of olive oil and honey and vinegar which has been triturated with lead, and an enema of vinegar and honey which has been mixed together, for the property of honey is to soften and cleanse, and the vinegar makes the limb adhere, and especially when there is excess of stickiness and dryness.</end_of_turn
And when you have done this several times and you are confident that the limb is healed, then instill an enema of water which makes the flesh swell in it.</end_of_turn>
And take from vinegar some camphor and dissolve that in warmed oil; or that you instill some medicines which have the properties which I have already written in the treatise of medicines.</end_of_turn
And if the opening of the limb is narrow through which the canula of the enema has not been received, then you should gradually widen it, and rest it in warm water wrapped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it is enlarged.</end_of_turn
Similarly, if the opening is wide, you should sew together its edges and leave them for the quantity of time that is necessary for the enema to be absorbed.</end_of_turn
And if the limb which has the pain is elevated to the upper parts, then dry that area in the bottom of the limb which is in it, for the limb will be forced to go down when the limb is straightened, since when the limb is bent in the bend of the limb the flesh will be pressed against it.</end_of_turn
And if it is not possible for you to dry the limb outside of the bone according to your wish, then you must make an incision that will prepare the limb according to the way in which you would do for a limb which is voluntarily bent according to your will, and that no cause should remain which would prevent the limb from being straightened.</end_of_turn
And so whoever is over the parts of the body which remain there for a whole hour, in order that they do not escape which is placed in them of the hand. And so that you know that it escapes from them of the hand is neither hot nor cold, or is digested, or is not digested
And so you must consider the place of that body, if in it the patient feels pain or not, and if it is in it apostematus.
And when your medication is prolonged in this way, and you see the matter that is spilled over the parts of the body has already adhered, or if appropriate adherence, then remove the bandage or dressing the third day, and when you remove the dressing, change the dressing for another and renew it.
And so if at the body is almost free from the subtle virus, then do not despair of the adherence of it, because its healing is appropriate, because there are some people in whom the generation of flesh is delayed in the days of the plague, and in those there is benefit from its opposite
And if at the body almost a few days has passed and the hand is still undigested, then you know that the body does not adhere; and if the adherence of the body is delayed and this is the prolonged cause, then you must adjust in excision of the medicines, and if the medicines are humid in their substance and in their virtue, they are dry just as if they were dry today even if they were added excessively.
And the more that follows concerning which it is cured, is that you take of dry finicon and dissolve it in olive oil, and let it go over it like an ointment of the substance of vinegar, and then soften that with oil, and use of that.
And so it seems in that action, when not to the hand, dry finicon, more than when it is cooked until it is whole, use of that; or that you take mirra and aloes and incense, grind all of them and powder them over the honey when it is cold, and pour liquid over the bandage and strengthen that over the body; and pour liquid over the honey which you have cooked until it is whole, and powder it over the bandage and strengthen that.
And many other herbs are administered with it according to long tradition and the reason of celestial lilies (and these are celestial lilies) and barley flour and centaury, and use of those simples or adjusted, grind them and crush them and powder them over the honey which I have recommended; and use of that
And if the body is prolonged, and it is not healing for this treatment, then you know that the corruption is in the head of it, and already make inquiry in the bones or in the other members durable or to the ligaments; then you must treat it with fistular care, as it is said.</start_of_turn>
Of care of carbuncles and nails attracted and incision of the digit added and section.</start_of_turn>
Carbuncles are apostemata which do not leave the nail of the finger of the hand or foot out of the palm of the hand or foot, and which, when prolonged, are less valued in their care, or are apostemata of apostemata caused by cautery, or are corrupted, and discharge blood until it consumes the root of the nail, and when it consumes all of that, and when it has reached the bone, it emits an offensive odor, and the limb is fainter, and the color of it is fainter.
Therefore when you have that which we have said in the division and you do not confirm your treatment, then know that you must insert all the force that is able to break the root of the nail and immediately cauterize the wound immediately with liquid, because the burn is not useful in this.
And if the bone is soft and the nail is sound, and the humors of the nail have already penetrated the flesh to the bones, and are beginning to burst and swell, then know that you must leave the edge of the nail which is biting the flesh alone, and prick that with your finger and pierce that flesh with ease, and pour liquid over that which remains of the flesh of the medicines which are corrosive until it is all absorbed; and immediately care for that which remains of the flesh until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And if the corruption has already taken hold in the bone, then know that you must extract the bone and remove it, for no time is it useful that it be corrupted in it.</start_of_turn>
If sometimes corruption and decay spread in the toe, then you insert that on one of the nails as is foreseen in the indication, and then care for that until it is healed.
If the nail should break due to percussion or cutting, and if there is pain in the nail, then at the beginning of the treatment you must apply some unguents to the patient, and then dry the nail with a sharp knife in a transverse cut from front to back, and take care that the cut does not reach the pulp that is left under the nail, for this would cause increased pain, and if the nail is too deeply affected, it will cause swelling in the area. And care for that area where the pain persists.
The nail being treated is that of a man of ordinary stature, strong in the flesh, strong in the bones, or strong in the nail.
These nails are born in the space between the joints, or the birth of the nails in the bones of the toe The nail that is born in the bones of the toe is not bad, but the one that is born in the joints is more painful.
And of those nails that are fleshy, the cut is slight, and you must insert that which must be the cause of its root under the skin at the side.
And of those that are born in the space between the joints, the cure is difficult; therefore take care of the separation of the nails from each other
If in the toe you must remove the nails, then at the beginning of the treatment you must cut the root of the nails to the bone, and then scrape with one of those saws that are convenient to you, and care for that until it is healed
If consolidation occurs in the toe between the soft parts or for the birth of the fetus, or for consolidation of pus or for burning of fire, or for stiffness, then you must take care that this consolidation disappears before the nails return to their natural shape
And so you must leave between the layers of hair a smear of olive oil so that they are not fixed together, and separate between them, or put between them a layer of thin lead until it is consolidated as much as you think necessary.
Similarly if consolidation occurs in the bones of the toe with the palm, then you must dry that consolidation according to what is prepared and convenient to the figure of the limb.
From the beginning of vice, so are varices.
Vices are varices, and these are veins that are wrapped around thick veins filled with black bile that flow in the limbs of the body, and their greatest progress is in the veins of the wanderers, the laborers, and the sailors.
Therefore you must administer purgatives of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then draw blood from the basilica vein of the patient
There are two methods for treating them: one is to prick and let black bile leak out, and the other is to elevate the vein and extract all of its blood.
The cutting of them is like this: with the first finger you must embrace the limb at the beginning with cold water until the black bile is resolved, which is useful for the limb, and then tighten the limb of the patient at the part furthest from the navel with a bandage, and then dry the vein in one place, or in two or three in a wide section, and then elevate the black bile to the navel with the thumb of the hand furthest from the limb, and withdraw it in juice, until the quantity that you want has been withdrawn, and the one that is left will restore the virtue of the limb.
And so you must do the same, and order them to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the treatment with flebotomy when the veins are engorged and until the patient is relieved of the pain
However, the elevation of them is like this: you must raise the limb of the patient, if there is movement in it, and then put it in water and embrace the limb with cold water until it turns pale and the veins become relaxed; or that you do it with exercise, if water is not available, until the limb is swollen
And so dry the cord in the root of the vein by cutting in the middle or at the end of it must remove the nail, or in the bottom must cut it off.
And so open the cord with scissors and remove the vein throughout until you feel it, and you must take notice that sometimes that request declines to blacken
Therefore when you avoid it and the cord becomes white like silk, you must know that it is a cord
And thus you must put your hand over that which lies beneath your elbow, so that it is raised up and away from the armpit, and suspend that which is once again below the elbow.
And thus you must cut another section alongside that section, and then stretch that section for three fingers, and then extract the armpit from under the vein until it appears.</end_of_turn>
And thus you must elevate that and pierce that in the lower section beside it, and then extract that and elevate that until it is level with the second section, and then extract that from the section above that.</end_of_turn>
And thus when you have extracted that from the section that is lower or higher than all the sections, until all is level; then pierce that.</end_of_turn>
And if you do not obey my advice to extract and elevate, then insert a needle with a strong double hook and grasp that and extract it, or insert your hand under that and rotate your hand over everything until it is bound.</end_of_turn> And take care that it is not pierced; for if it is broken, it is difficult to elevate that limb and it is harmful to the patient for that night.</end_of_turn>
And when everything is outside, pause over the area of the wound and cover it with soaked wool immersed in vinegar and olive oil, and oil that is not greasy, and care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the vein is contracted having pain at the parts which are wrapped around, and it is not in accordance with the rule as we have said, then you must cover your wound over all the parts where there is pain and the parts which are wrapped around, and then suspend that which is inside until you elevate that whole.</end_of_turn
And take care that your incision does not pierce the vein and that you do not irritate that, for it is difficult to elevate that limb; and use your prudence in that.</end_of_turn
Shape of the wound when the vein is dry.</end_turn
It is not acute like nails nor is it of sudden extremity for so that it does not pierce the vein; and it has great flexibility like a lion, for if it were slight, it would pierce the vein by its slightness; because of that it is necessary for it to have great thickness as we have said.</end_of_turn
Extraction of the vein of the thigh.</end_turn
This vein is engendered in the swamps in low-lying lands as well as in Arabia Major and the Indian lands that are dry and arid with little vegetation and in which there is no tree or shrub.</end_turn
And it is also engendered in other parts of the body in other places.</end_turn
And the origin of it is putrefaction which leaves the armpit like that in which the venom of serpents and worms and beetles and worms is engendered between the armpit and the flesh.</end_turn
And the sign of the approach of the coming of this is that this vein happens in the limb with violent inflammation; and the place is swollen; and the vein begins to burst from that place where the swelling seems to be like a wound from a plant.</end_turn
And when you see the limb, then cover that with a plum whose weight is equal to two drachs. Enter into two drachs, and notice that and leave the plum suspended from the limb.</end_of_turn>
And as many times as there are causes to the parts outside, you must cover that with lead and neglect that.</end_turn And if the limb is not prolonged, then you must pierce a part of it and bandage the remaining; and do not pierce that which is from outside and has come out, for if you pierce that it is contracted and enters the flesh and causes inflammation and swelling in the place and ulceration.</end_turn
So that you must treat it gently and extract it little by little, until it is outside the back of the limb and does not stay in the limb any longer for any cause.</end_turn
And from this vein is seen in some men who is of its length of five palms and a thumb and I have already known of one that was xx palms long.</end_turn
And if it is pierced at the time of its treatment, then you must insert the needle into the root of the limb and pierce that which is along the limb of the body, until it is evacuated all that is in the matter, and administer putrefying matter to the place for several days with medicines; and care for that for the healing of ulcers.</end_turn
The veins in the ankles become swollen, especially when they are swollen in the foot or ankle joint, and cause great pain, which is why it is called gout.
Therefore, take care of that as we said before and as we have mentioned previously.</end_of_turn>
From the section above, worms are generated under the skin and it is called bovine fever.</end_of_turn>
This disease is called in every land bovine fever because it causes worms to appear in the blood of cows and is very harmful to them. It causes swelling and pain throughout the body, and it appears in the sense that it causes damage to the limbs until it breaks the bone and comes out.</end_of_turn
And its cause is the putrefaction of some humors as well as by the bites of worms and serpents, and by the presence of worms and lice in the belly.</end_of_turn
It is feared for the malice of these things, for when it comes to the head and is elevated, it causes great pain. It breaks through the skull and destroys the brain, and this is what causes the swelling.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, when you want to cure this and remove it, you must do so with great care and attention to the patient's condition. You must hold the limb firmly in place with your hands and prevent it from moving, and then dry the area around it and extract the foreign body.</end_of_turn
If it is pressing on the bone and you do not remove it, then hold the cautery pointed over the area until it stops moving. The greatest cause of fear is the corruption of the bone, as we have mentioned.</end_of_turn
In the same way, if sometimes this thing reaches the head near the brain, then grasp the nail firmly with great strength, and then dry the area around it and extract the foreign body. And let the patient be treated with medications that evacuate harmful putrid humors, and keep him away from foods that cause putrefaction.</end_of_turn
Therefore, take care of that as we said before and as we have mentioned previously.</end_of_turn
This disease is called in our land nafir, and the pain is what is seen in all the limbs, and it is usually transferred from limb to limb.</end_of_turn
And indeed, I have already seen that which I told you before.</end> I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I saw that her arms were swollen and that there was a small swelling in the funis vein of the arm. And when I left for an hour, I saw that the swelling had gone down as much as it had increased at first, even though it seemed like silver when it ran from place to place.</end_of_turn
And then I went away from the pain of that limb and rested on the muscle, and I stayed there for an hour.
And then I went to the other limb until I reached the other arm.</end_of_turn>
And I recommended to him that he should rotate his limbs all over his body as I saw; and I was amazed at the transformation of things and at the speed of the limbs.</end_of_turn And I had already seen before that thing in my travels following that manner, but I have seen that many others have found pain in being transformed from limb to limb.</end_of_turn However, I have not seen that in the limbs like that woman.</end_of_turn
And I do not think that this is anything but because the woman was old, who had dry bones and exposed veins, and in this appearance there is that sudden movement that causes the transformation.</end_of_turn
And it is necessary that this does not appear according to this retrograde reasoning in those who are delicate and have humid bodies with veins hidden under the skin.</end_of_turn
And when you want to cure this, and the patient feels that pain, do not rely on your eyes alone like we have said. Rather, grasp that limb firmly and leave it pleasantly surprised and dry until that violent movement has subsided, and cauterize the area.</end_of_turn
However, if you do not see it often in the limbs, when you cure it you will see that it is an expulsion of the body and that it eliminates the violent movement, and you will praise those pills that are beneficial and those that are of serape and similar.</end_of_turn
From the extraction of arrows.</end_of_turn
Arrows are diversified according to their species and according to the locations of the body in which they are found, because their diversity is that some have large heads, others have small heads, and some have concave, solid, or flexible heads.</end_of_turn
And thus, when the foot or any other limb is affected, the cause is either that the principal humors of the body, such as the blood, heart, spleen, lungs, bowels, bladder, and kidneys, are affected in some way, or that there is an inflammation of these members. Therefore, when any of these humors appears at the surface of the body, it is called gout.

More so if the splinter is in the heart, for then it is in the left breast and cannot be extracted without causing great harm; and you must know that the movement of the splinter is similar to that of a wound, and is like that of the black death, and if there is any coldness of the limbs, and swelling, and oppression; therefore you must know that death is imminent.

And the signs when the lung has been struck by the splinter are like those of the sacred sponge of the plague, and the blood vessels are so close to bursting, and the color of the disease is changed, and great breath is exhaled, and there is a request for fresh air.

And concerning the other members as well, such as the face, neck, shoulder, arms and legs, chest and back, spine and pelvis, these are saved according to the greatest capacity when the splinter does not find a vein or artery and is not a venomous splinter.
E eu recomtare aquo a tu que he vist del esser de aquestas sagetas, per que signifique per aquo sobre la curacio tieua.
The cause of this is that in a certain man who was struck by an arrow in the eye of his nose, and I extracted that from the other side, I left the gray matter of the eye, and he is healthy, and it does not hurt him in his eye at night.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew who was struck in the gray of his eyebrow, I left the eyelid behind, and the arrow was already hidden and could not be retrieved until a little piece of it adhered to the eyebrow, and it was a great arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with a lion's head in which there were no barbs
And thus is the Jew, and he does not suffer from the wound in his eyebrow at all
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian who was struck in the groin, and it was an Arabian arrow, and there are barbs on it; and when I saw that it was submerged in the groin of the patient, I took hold of it with my hand, and I extracted it, and the Christian is healthy
And I extracted another arrow from a man who was struck in the lower belly, and I thought he would surely die from it; and therefore, since he had passed xxx days and had not recovered from anything of his ailments, I pierced the arrow and extracted it, and he is healthy, and he does not suffer from any wound.
And I saw a man who was struck by an arrow in both of his eyes, and consolidation of the swelling was made over them; and when I had been there for seven years, I saw the arrow at the root of the swelling.
And I saw a woman who was struck by an arrow in the lower belly, and the swelling was consolidated without her knowledge, and she has not suffered from any of her natural operations since then
And I saw another man who was struck by an arrow in his face, and the swelling was consolidated and the arrow was broken, without any pain, and he remained like that for a long time.
And I extracted the arrow from the prince of the king who was struck in the middle of his nose, and it had already begun to decline from the wound, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to treat him when the arrow had been there for three days.
And when I arrived I saw that the swelling from the arrow was not severe; and when I asked about the cause of the pain, he did not feel any pain; however, he still felt the tip of the arrow that had been left behind, and I hoped that that was the cause of the pain
And I plastered the area with an astringent and digestive plaster, confident that the swelling would disappear because of the presence of the arrow, which would dry up over that area.
And there was no significant accident at the site of the arrow. I continued to apply the plaster for several days, and there was no further pain; the swelling had subsided and the patient no longer felt the pain of the extraction for several days after the arrow had been removed from his nose.
And then I left the acute corrosive dressing for several days until I had seen enough; and when I had examined it, I found the tip of the arrow adhering to the bone.
And I adjusted the dressing for the wound for that medicine until I saw the tip of the arrow, and I left it like that for a while.
And when the swelling had subsided, I thought it would be possible to remove the forceps, and I bound it up again, and did not notice anything; however, I did not cease to work, but I continued to examine and manipulate the area in various ways, until one day I was able to remove the arrow without causing any further pain, according to the fashion of those in power at the end of the chapter, and I restored the wound
And many doctors believe that the cartilage of the nose is not restored, and I restored that and the swelling is consolidated, and the patient is completely healed, and I do not recall any subsequent illness in him
I recommend to you the quality of extracting arrows, for you should pause and reflect on what I have not said, because the causes of these ailments and the definitions of these matters are not comprehended in this narrative or in general
And wise artists compare themselves to little with the pauc; and in what is present they are absent; and they find new operations and new instruments which must descend from the causes of the disease when they arise
Therefore I say that the sagittae are not outside the members in which they are placed, but according to two methods: either by attraction of the place in which they intersect; or contrariwise to the other part.
And that which is placed in the place where it enters, or is a sagitta proceeding from the flesh, is shot and expelled.</end_of_turn>
And if you do not obey this time when it is necessary, the hour commands that you leave it lying for a few days until the surrounding flesh has recovered, and that the traction of the parts and their escape be alleviated.</end_of_turn>
And in the same way if it is placed in bones and you do not obey this time, the hour commands you to leave it lying for a few days and repeat that traction and movement in every day, and it will be expelled.</end_of_turn
And if you do not obey this time immediately, the hour commands that you perforate in the circuit of the sagitta in that bone throughout its extent until the part is stretched out by the sagitta, and then extract that.</end_of_turn
May be if the sagitta is already hidden in the part of the body and is hidden from feeling, the hour commands you to inquire about it, and if you feel it, the hour pulls that which is convenient for the traction of it.</end_of_turn
And if you are unable to do this because of the constriction of the plague and the length of the period, and here neither bone nor nerve nor vein is concerned, the hour commands you to wait for the plague to be amplified so that the sagitta may be extracted.</end_of_turn
And if you are in doubt about these things which are prolonged, the hour commands you to break open the flesh in which it is placed throughout its extent with all the skill you can muster; and consult about this, if you are unable to effect the evacuation of the flesh from the fracture of the bones and twisting of those until you obey.</end_of_turn
And when you attempt the extraction of the sagitta in any place, the hour commands you to use with torque your hand and forceps at all times until you have accomplished that; and take care that there is no fracture of the sagitta and that it is easily pulled out and that the extraction is successful.</end_of_turn
And if you are unable to do this of your hour, the hour commands you to leave it lying for several days until the parts which are in the circuit of it have recovered, and then repeat that which the hour has recommended as being alleviated.</end_of_turn May be if you do contrary to the flow of custom, the hour commands you to administer what we have said of care in the head.</end_of_turn
And preserve your prudence in the incision of a vein or a nerve, or a string, and administer your skill in every way possible for the evacuation of the sagitta; and do this with facility, tranquility, speed and calmness as I have said and as you have recommended.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must pull out the sagitta so that the disease is according to the figure according to which you must cure the case of the sagitta in it, for this is more beneficial.</end_of_turn May be if this is not possible for you, the hour commands you to administer what is possible for you according to the figures.</end_of_turn
May be the sagittas which are expelled from the other side, or which have already proceeded from one part to another, or cause stiffness of the transmission of the sagitta by feeling of the part which is lower than the proximate; in this case you must desist from this; and let the incision be according to the quantity in which the forceps grasp; and then pull that out, for it is easily pulled out.</end_of_turn
May be if it is retained in the bone, the hour commands you to twist the flesh according to the contrary until the sagitta is pressed into the bone, and expand it, and then extract that.</end_of_turn
If not, leave her for a few days, and then repeat the procedure until it disappears.
If the swelling persists at the tip of the toe, then you must pierce it with the cautery.</end_of_turn>
Even if the swelling has receded and you wish to administer a pulse, then you must enter with your hand and, if necessary, twist to bring the swelling close to the tip of the toe, and then pierce it.</end_of_turn
If the toe is concave, then you must pierce it with the pointed cautery at a strong point to relieve the swelling.</end_of_turn>
If the toe is venomous, then you must cover the entire area around the swelling, if possible, and take care of the area around it as necessary.</end_of_turn
If the swelling is close to the foot, or on the belly, or in the bladder, or in the chest, and is near enough to touch, then touch it with your hand and if possible drain it out. Then remove the intestine or hernia and hold your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
Method of forceps for the treatment of swellings:</start_of_turn>
Their extremities are like the beak of a sparrow when they are affected by pain from the swelling so that they do not leave it behind.</start_of_turn
And these are diverse species of forceps, great, small, few and many, according to the quantity of the greatness of the swelling and its scarcity, and the extent of the wound, and the constriction of the area.</start_of_turn
like this to alleviate the pain of the swelling in the concave area and to administer a pulse to that area.</start_of_turn>
Of the treatment of veins.</start_of_turn
The veins that are usually bled during flebotomy are ...</start_of_turn of which there are sixteen in the head.</start_of_turn There are two pulsating veins that are close to the ankles, which are called the anterior tibial; two veins that are in the two temporal regions that appear; two veins that are in the two lacrimal ducts of two holes that are called the aspicient veins; a vein that is in the middle of the forehead; a vein that is at the tip of the nose; two veins that are in the earlobes; two veins that are in the lips; and two veins that are on the tongue.</start_of_turn The veins that are bled during flebotomy in the limbs are about five.</start_of_turn Except for the cephalic vein which is in the temple and is called the great vein of the head, and is dark; the people call “the head vein”; the vein is small, and is composed of a branch of the basilica and another branch of the cephalic; and this one they call “the vein of all the body”; the basilica vein is one that is stopped in the domestic latch and is called “citellar”; and the people call those “the belly veins”; funis of the arm, which is stopped over the elbow and is the one that is bled during flebotomy, and that appears on the outside of the elbow due to its visibility; and the ulnar vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and is in these two branches.</start_of_turn
And in the foot and the ankle there are three veins; one of which is beyond the curvature of the bone of the little toe; the second is the sural vein, the place of which is beyond the ankle of the domestic latch; and the sciatic vein, the place of which is beyond the ankle of the little toe; and in the ankle there are other veins similar to these.</start_of_turn
The treatment of the veins that are close to the ankles is to cauterize the ancient varicose veins, embolism, hematoma and old ulcers of the head.</start_of_turn
And the quality of cauterizing these veins is according to what I recommend to you: that the head of the patient should be calm and the head of the patient should be frequently supported in the occipital region where the two veins are close to the ankles in two depressed places of the head; and that you should tighten the patient's limb with a bandage around the area where the two veins are close to the ankles in two places. And if you feel faint from these veins, here is a sign that you should stop.</start_of_turn
Aprop tu pren la lancea cutellar, e es aquela que es inscident, e aprop tu intromet aquel dejos la vena en la codena entro que·l fleubotomi vengua al os. Then take hold of the lancet, which is the one that is incidental, and bring your hand with the vein and the cord to the parts below and pierce the vein at the point of incidence.</end_of_turn> And let the length of the incision be the quantity of two fingers adjusted or around that; and do it as well as you can.</end_of_turn>
Then strengthen the area with powder and leave that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And already before we begin, we must make the incision of those and cauterize them.</end_of_turn
More of the two veins or arteries that are in the temples that help with the phlebotomy is the ancient emigration that is bad and slow and bilious and acute edema of the bones.</end_of_turn
And the quality of phlebotomy of those is according to what I recommend to you: constrict the patient's limbs so that the two veins appear to the sense of sight manifested and be confirmed by their pulsation that they are those. And when you see that, then do it.</end_of_turn
Then elevate the cord above the vein to the parts below as I have said indicated, and make the phlebotomy incision from outside, and elevate the vein in its place; and pierce that as well as you have done with the two veins above; and do it according to the amount of your need.</end_of_turn
Then remove the dressing from the patient, and rest the hand over the vein for an hour, and then put a compress over that bandage and powder and strengthen that area with strong constriction, and leave that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And already before we begin, we must remember the incisions and the traction in the beginning.</end_of_turn
And therefore the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is similar to the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein to the ancient diseases of the face and to emigration and dropsy and fetid ulcers.</end_of_turn
And the quality of the phlebotomy of these is according to what I recommend to you; so that the patient tightens his limbs with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take hold of the instrument which is called forceps of which this is the form.</end_of_turn
Pause the puncture immediately which is at the head of the forceps over that vein and pierce it at a slant or in another way as you desire; and let the blood run out according to the amount you want; and then remove the perforation of the patient and strengthen that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And many veins are opened by phlebotomy, but it does not mean that the phlebotomy is of acute extremity just as the others, because it is of remote extremity, and phlebotomize that according to the traverse, that is, when the bone is properly and firmly grasped in it.
More the benefit of the two veins that are in the tears of two eyes for the scab of the bones for dropsy and swelling in the bones, and to the diseases of the face.</end_of_turn>
And the quality of the phlebotomy is that the patient tightens his limb with a bandage, and then phlebotomize those, and you remain standing above his head.</end_of_turn
And let the phlebotomy be done according to the traverse of a little distance to the phlebotomy of a little distance, because in the place it is not bone; and if the phlebotomy is superficial, firmly grasp the limb at that point.</end_of_turn
Then let the blood run out as much as you need, and rest over those parts, and strengthen them for a night, and then remove them.</end_of_turn
More the phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is concerned with acute fever and violent sweating, and with the diseases of the face and emigration and dropsy that occur in the face, and more especially when it is ancient.</end_of_turn
And the quality of the phlebotomy of these is that the patient tightens his limb and brings his nose to his left hand, and takes the phlebotomy superficial long and stays in the middle of the head of the nose according to the rule, because the vein does not appear to the sense here, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.</end_of_turn
Beware that you finish your hand with the phlebotomy little by little and make the blood run out according to your need; and keep that for a night, because that is restored with delight.</end_of_turn
The joint pain caused by cold humors infiltrating the body results in pain in the feet, which is commonly called gout by doctors.
The quality of the inflammation of those is that the patient suffers from some degree of swelling in the groin; and the artist should place their hands over the head of the patient, and the patient should sit on a chair.
Then gently massage the vein along with the large and small flebotomy; and extract blood in accordance with the temperature or as often as necessary; and do so with the other vein as well
Then remove the ligament and tighten the two veins slightly more to prevent the patient from fainting, and leave the wound open until the plague is healed.</start_of_turn>
The benefit of the flebotomy of the veins is to relieve small boils and pimples of the mouth, corruption of the gums, harmful ulcers and fissures, and harmful ulcers that are in the nose and in the surrounding area.</start_of_turn
The quality of the inflammation of those is that it causes the patient to vomit immediately, tightens the throat, and causes them to turn their lips blue; two veins should be ligated, one from the right lip and the other from the left lip; and the mark of some of them is that the color of some of both is black; and more so in the surrounding area of those veins are many small black veins; and where any of them has been pierced, there is an opening.</start_of_turn>
If you are in doubt, do not hesitate; and do not know which of those is the cause, when you arrive at the incision of the greatest of them, and the discharge of pus from them will be evident.</start_of_turn
Like the two veins that are in the lips outside.</start_of_turn>
More useful for the two veins that are in the lip outside is the flebotomy of the cephalic vein to prevent the swelling of the tonsils, the disease of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth.</start_of_turn
The quality of bleeding those is that it follows the patient between their teeth until it spits out the tongue, raises the tongue and holds the tongue from the one side by the vein and from the other side by the vein, and the color of each of them is turning black.</start_of_turn
And so bleed each one; and take care that you do not touch the vein with your hand, for it is an artery.</start_of_turn
And the veins that are bled in the groin are usually those in which people usually bleed in all households, and the flebotomy of these is useful in two ways: either by making multiple small punctures or by making a large puncture with an olive-shaped needle that is blunt at the tip. Or by making a small incision and applying pressure until bleeding stops; and this is the way to do it.</start_of_turn
Both the veins and the surrounding area appear to contain thick blood clots that are visible on the surface.
This is a smaller puncture with less external pressure, and it is suitable for bleeding from thin veins that contain thin blood clots.</start_of_turn
The greatest benefit of the flebotomy of the basilica vein is that it is one of the three veins that extract the blood from the swelling of the tonsils and the gut, and from which blood is drained from the feet and the belly.</start_of_turn
The flebotomist should take great care when performing this flebotomy, as if it were an artery, and if there is a slip or mistake in the puncture of the flebotomy, they will puncture the artery and blood will flow freely, which will cause the patient to faint if it is not stopped immediately.</start_of_turn
If the basilica does not appear to be bleeding immediately, then you should leave that one and move to the other, or seek some other branch nearby; or that you bleed from the end of the arm, which is also bleeding profusely; and you should clamp that one immediately as well, as we have said.</start_of_turn
May be if you want to perform a flebotomy on them, then cover the wrist that touches the part until you reach the elbow; and then hold it firmly there; and ligate the wrist and cut the vein with a concave incision as we have said; and keep pressure on the area until the bleeding has ceased.
And when you see, as you have said, that the ligament is stretched, swelling in the place that you have marked with your thumb, then know that that swelling is swelling of the artery, and therefore stop that
And if sometimes blood flows during the flebotomy just like urine of a child, know that the blood is thin, for that is the blood of the artery; and keep your hand steady and pause the wound for a long distance; and then close the wound, and if the blood is clotted, know that the blood vessels have been torn; then strengthen your arm and let go of the wound.
And guard the patient from the discharge of the wound, and be over-cautious of them and do not let them move for some days until they are healed.
Or if the blood is not clotted, and sometimes when you must not call a physician for this, then you must cut the artery if you see it; for the limb is contracted, and the blood is clotted; or that you take a short forceps, and take that out, and take hold of the vein with your thumb and strengthen that over the area of the stricture of the ligament and the powder within until tomorrow.
And if the blood is clotted, it is not good; otherwise, know that you must cure that from which the clot of blood originates to the memory of the place where the blood vessels were clotted.
And the amputation of the limb is difficult in many cases because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of injury to the brachial ligament
And from the jugular vein the flebotomy is useful that it removes the blood from the upper part of the head and from the lower part of the body; for it is composed of the branches of the basilica and of the cephalic branch, as we have said
And cover the flebotomist in case of excessive fear in the flebotomy of the limb, for there is a nerve there; and when you prick the vein for the flebotomy and touch the nerve, you cause dizziness, and it is difficult for the patient to recover, and often does not recover at all; and this nerve is often hidden in many people and is subtle and is not shown. Therefore know that you must stop the flebotomy when you see it with the cut of the vein and avoid the nerve with your strength
And if the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein lengthwise.
The usefulness of the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it removes the blood from the head and comforts the pains of the limbs.
And take care in this way, if you want the phlebotomist to prick with olive oil or with myrrh; for that is the saving of all the veins, for it is not of the artery nor the nerve
Moreover, it is often forgotten in many people, when it is not performed at the first percussion, that it is not noticed in that lapse.
The first of these is that you must know that the flebotomy is not administered except in the conservation of health and in hope of recovery and caution against the occurrence of diseases, and that the proper flebotomy is in one of the veins that are in the groin, that is: cephalic, femoral and basilica; and that the proper time for the flebotomy is at the beginning of spring, in the middle of spring and autumn, and in winter when there are significant signs of replenishment.
And the proper time for the flebotomy is every third day or at the first moment when three hours have passed since the morning meal
Moreover, the flebotomy that is administered must not cause inconvenience or necessity for this, neither at night nor during the day, at any hour and at any time.<end_turn>
And you must know that it is not appropriate to perform the flebotomy before the age of thirteen years, and in women it should not be performed before the fourth month after delivery, and in old people it should not be performed to those who have already passed their seventeenth year
When someone wants to be treated for any kind of pain, let him modify his bowels before the blistering is done with the lithtrum, for if there is any retained wound there, so that the veins do not draw out the surplus from the blistering of the bowels, which are pushed, and that they do not damage the principal members.
Do not make the patients nauseous by excessive sweating or crapulence, nor avoid sickness or drunkenness until it has passed from them, neither bad air nor water-logging, and more than anything avoid excessive colica, vomiting, and eating, as well as excessive lying down, sleeplessness, fasting, or other causes that dissolve virtue, or be bodily or animal
And consider carefully the temperament of humors before giving him food and drink, and medicines if it is possible at all
And enter into water if any cause does not prohibit, or be exercised by any exercise so that the patient be relieved.
And stop the blistering of the feet at the third hour, as we have said before.</start_of_turn>
Beware that the foot of that patient be protected on that day from all kinds of animal accidents, as well as from annoyance, wrath, fear, and all bodily accidents, as well as from work, excessive sweating, and lying down and similar things to them.</start_of_turn>
And to his seat let him be present the causes from which it is customary for men to suffer from aromaticness and odor, and from fat and similarity to them, according to the quantity of possibility.</start_of_turn
Follow the phlebotomist over a cushion that is more solid than the cushion of that which must be phlebotomized.</start_of_turn
And take hold of his arms, and cool that with your hand the phlebotomist twice or thrice; and tighten the ligature with cord and involve that twice.</start_of_turn
And be the tightening temperate, which is neither too tight nor too loose, for the tightening when it is excessive prohibits the flow of the patient; or is too little, and the patient's body is exhausted.
And tighten the ligature so that those who must be phlebotomized cool their hands between them until the veins are swollen, and declare it to the feeling.</start_of_turn
And the phlebotomist should anoint the patient's vein with a little oil beforehand; and then stop the patient's hand with his left hand on that vein from which the phlebotomy is to be made, so that the vein escapes a little, and the percussion is relaxed because the vein is the one that has been struck by the phlebotomy, and that is full of air when the phlebotomy is stopped over that one, and is discovered by the phlebotomist; and the phlebotomy does not break the vein, and if it breaks, that is stretched.</start_of_turn
Therefore, in order that the phlebotomist should be calmed and be asked in all these matters.</start_of_turn
And in case the vein is punctured in a vein, more than that, do not do it; otherwise you repeat what you have done and leave that place a little, or do without fasting.
And if the place is swollen, or the patient becomes pale, do not tighten the ligature, for that will cause excessive swelling, or do not enter the water.
Repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.</start_of_turn>
And if the opening is small and the patient is recovering well, and you fear that the patient will not recover the amount you wish, then repeat the phlebotomy in that place according to the rule and adjust a little in the opening, and do without fasting until the place is swollen, for the place is swollen in many people because of little opening.</start_of_turn
More often than not, if the patient has already swollen, do not repeat over it, for that is not for you to do for any cause; and pause on any part of the wound of oil, which alleviates the patient's body.</start_of_turn It is better in this place than oil and the others.</start_of_turn
Similarly, administer the wound of oil in every phlebotomy in which you puncture the veins due to the prohibition of the patient's body, and make it thick and viscous when it is stopped from one of those over the place, for the patient is calmed and is relaxed when it is small.</start_of_turn
If in the place of the flebotomy there is generated great swelling, which causes veins to burst especially in those which have not bled, or in the opening of the small vein, then immediately stop the procedure and place over the area a sponge soaked in water and salt, with a little vinegar, and keep it there for an hour, which is sufficient to dissolve it.
And that you do this immediately with the blood of that vein or with another vein.</end_of_turn>
And if you stay in the place for a few days, any black or green discoloration does not matter; and if you wish, stop the cause of this discomfort and dissolve it with mercury, or any cause of saliva or bile or something similar.</end_of_turn>
The veins burst causing swelling and eminences, therefore the flebotomy should be performed from the basilica.</end_of_turn
Therefore stop your hand there, and if you notice that there is too much bleeding, put your compression there, for that swelling is bad and harmful; and know that you must stop any cause of that which we have said, for there is strong flow from the great vein.</end_of_turn
And put on some plaster with water which is styptic, so that the area is firm, and take care of the other cure until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And take out of the vein all the blood according to the quantity of its power and according to the color of the blood remaining in the vein according as it appears.</end_of_turn
For if the vein is black, then leave it closed until it is well; and in the same way if you see it thick, leave it closed until it is reduced; and in the same way if it is acute, leave it closed until the pain has passed.</end_of_turn
And know that whoever is full and strong and needs to extract blood in a single vein, that the flebotomy of the vein must be increased and be large.</end_of_turn
And in those who are pale, do the opposite, and know that you must extract it in small quantities, and that the bleeding must be slight.</end_of_turn
The best thing in performing a vein flebotomy is to make a transverse section, not a puncture.</end_of_turn>
This method of flebotomy is safe from the flow of blood and the injury of nerves, and is more useful and safe than the large and extensive flebotomy.</end_of_turn>
And in which it is customary to cause syncope you must perform the flebotomy, and know that you must treat it before the flebotomy with a little piece of bread infused in wine instead of a thousand grains or of simple vinegar; and extract a little of the blood from the vein in three or four doses.</end_of_turn
And if it is a cold sensation of congestion, then before performing the flebotomy give an infusion of eyewater with mercury or with aromatic eyewater with spices such as cinnamon, ginger and the like, or with aromatic and fragrant eyewater.</end_of_turn
And if there is a fainting during the process, know that it is due to the lack of blood, and immediately stop and give wine with aromatic water; and use aromatic plants such as chamomile, and keep the patient's legs well bandaged.</end_of_turn
And use other causes which have been said in the division on fainting for evacuation.</end_of_turn
And whoever wants to avoid fainting and dissolve the blood as quickly as possible, know that the flebotomy is for the evacuation of the blood, and the power of it is cold, which evacuates the blood slowly, according to the quantity of the power in the continuous days.</end_of_turn
Whoever wants to avoid fainting and recover the blood as quickly as possible, and the body is strong, then do the first flebotomy within seven or eight hours of the first flebotomy.</end_of_turn
Whoever wants to withdraw the blood from the body contrary to the part which is declining, know that this must be done on the second or third day.</end_of_turn
Whoever in a body in which there is no blood left is acute and causes the fever, know that you must extract the blood from the vein in a single dose and extract a large quantity of it and amplify the opening until fainting does not occur, because you have preserved all the conditions of flebotomy; and that you place your hand over the pulse of the vein you must prevent the patient from dying from fainting, because sometimes the flebotomist is ignorant and negligent.</end_of_turn
And do not do what you want to loosen the arms and evacuate the blood according to the measure, when the orifice of the vein is already closed and it is difficult to bleed the blood, for you must praise above all these things and extend your hand widely, because too little is too bad.</end>
The patient's limb is flexible; or remain with the acute pain of the phlegm which is coagulated in the orifice of the vein; or suspend over that of tyriaca alfarach, or of sage, and compress that which is until the phlegm comes out.
If the vein is congested, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the congestion is calmed.</end_of_turn>
And if necessary you must evacuate the phlegm according to the situation, and it is not an excuse, then do so over that area or in another vein on the other arm.</end_of_turn>
And the vein called "funis brachi" is flexible in the place of the flesh or the bone, when it is not inflamed or hidden, which is composed of those.</end_of_turn
And the quality of the phlebitis of the limb is that the patient inserts his hand into cold water until the pain subsides and the vein appears clearly.</end_of_turn
Then strengthen that area around that ligament and stricture, and phlebotomize according to the small transverse, not latitudinally or longitudinally.</end_of_turn
And let the incision be wide and your phlebotomy with which you phlebotomize that over the wrist joint a little.</end_of_turn>
And if the flow of the phlegm is prohibited, then repeat the hand in cold water and let the phlegm run in the water until you achieve your purpose.</end_of_turn
May it be on the days of summer, however, you are excused from the repetition of the hand in cold water, and the body of the patient is kept in cold water during the summer.</end_of_turn
And the phlebotomy of this vein is more safe than all the others, for there is no pulsating vein or nerve in it.</end_of_turn
The phlebotomy of the swelling of the right wrist is related to the diseases of the gout.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of the limb is that you strengthen the hand by ligament or by hand, since you have placed it in cold water, until the vein is inflamed and is clearly shown at the same time; and phlebotomize that transversely; and if you prick it from all sides it will not cause any pain.</end_of_turn
And take care that you do not touch your hand with the phlebotomy, because you leave the nerves of the fingers denuded of flesh.</end_of_turn
And repeat the hand in cold water and let the phlegm run in that, for if you do not repeat it in cold water, the phlegm will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, and there will be no flow.</end_of_turn
And when the phlegm is extracted according to the amount of need, then pause over the vein with oil and salt, so that it is not solidified too firmly; and keep the area covered so that your fingers do not become stiff.</end_of_turn
More helpful is the phlebotomy of the swelling of the left wrist, because it is related to the diseases of the spleen.</end_of_turn
And do the same in the phlebotomy of this.
The benefit of the phlebotomy of the median vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as major diseases, retention of menstruation, and diseases of the tonsils and ulcers of organs and ancient wounds.</end_of_turn
And the quality of the phlebotomy of the limb is that the patient puts his whole foot in cold water and makes on that friction until the veins appear; and place a bandage over the wrist joint and the area of the vein that appears must be obvious, and from that branch out on the face of the foot several veins.</end>
Therefore phlebotomize the most extensive branch or leave the bandage over the area where the swelling is to prevent the accumulation of blood, which is better and more salt.</end>
And if you phlebotomize that area of the foot, then you must guard the nerves that are left over that area of the foot, and suspend your phlebotomy at the point where you phlebotomize, as if you were pricking it.</end
And be careful.
May it be prohibited to remove the phlegm; however, repeat the foot in cold water and let the phlegm run in that until it is evacuated.</end>
If the surgeon errs in the first portion of the procedure, repeat the operation a few times until the area is completely healed; for the limb is salt. Do not fear the patient's malice, but beware the nerves as we have said.
In the same way do from the other foot the engagement.
And concerning the sciatic nerve, as we have said, its place is beside the heel, leaving the heel bone free from the hairy part of the limb
The aid for the phlebotomy is the support of the ankle when it is for the healing of the burn.
The quality of the phlebotomy is that the patient groans, sweats and tightens the clothes of the lower part from the hip down to the heel, up to four fingers, with a long bandage that does not appear except for this.
Therefore when it appears, repeat the phlebotomy as many times as possible and as the situation demands, for it is better; or insert it by incision or remove it by excision, for the limb is salt
And it is in most men more hidden; and if you find it, and it does not appear in the sensation of all, repeat the phlebotomy on some part of it, for that which appears in the two feet between the thumb and the ring finger is the most significant.</start_of_turn>
Beware of the nerves, and make the amount of healing run as much as you wish
Then remove the tension and place over the place of the phlebotomy a cushion and tighten the limb, for the curious thing is healed.</start_of_turn>
From the draft and the qualities of using these things.
Drafts are of corn, or of hemp, or of ivy.
And the draught is done in two ways: one is by sacrifice and extraction of pus, and the other is by draught without sacrifice.</start_of_turn
And this draught that is without sacrifice is done in two ways, that is either with fire or without fire.</start_of_turn>
And to the draughts that are administered with sacrifice and extraction of pus are fourteen parts of the body, of which one in which the draughts are stopped is the ankle; and the second part of the head; and the third part of the neck; and the fourth part of the chest; and the fifth part of the abdomen; and the sixth part of the groin; and the seventh part of the knee; and the eighth part of the elbow; and the ninth part of the wrist; and the tenth part of the thumb; and the eleventh part of the index finger; and the twelfth part of the middle finger; and the thirteenth part of the ring finger; and the fourteenth part of the little finger.</start_of_turn
And the draught does not extract pus from the great veins, but from the small veins scattered throughout the flesh, and for this it does not recover the virtue of these; just as is the case with phlebotomy; neither does it suffice that the draught should be done with fire or without fire in any disease that is not cured by emptying the whole body.</start_of_turn
And if it is necessary to provoke a draught for disease or for maintenance, administer it at the beginning and at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month and at any time.</start_of_turn
Therefore when several times in any of these causes, and especially if it is in the third or half of the month, they command that the draught be done more than two or three hours past the day.</start_of_turn
And the aid of the draught from the neck is that when it confers gravity to the head and to the water that is falling down the thighs; however, it does not suffice that it should be a prompt emptying of the whole body.</start_of_turn
And this draught is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.</start_of_turn
It is not allowed for anyone who is fatigued completely, or in whom there is congestion, for it gives great harm to these people.</start_of_turn
For that reason we do not use those old remedies, and on the heads of those in whom the disease is fiery.
May it be that whoever continues to do this over them will be fruitful in oblivion; and for that reason we command the windwarder to place his hand a little above the heels, fearing the generation of oblivion.
The windwarder of alcohol is better than phlebotomy of the veinous blood and of the bile: and for this we confer the vomiting, and to the constriction of the bile and to the scissura of the bile's suffering, and to cough, and to repletion
And we command that the vomiting of alcohol be covered with a little powder, for if it is stopped from below, it generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And the vomiting of almonds confers to headaches and ophthalmia, and diarrhea, and vertigo, and pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is better than phlebotomy of the veins
And we command the windwarder not to touch his hand with a sacrifice so that he does not prick the artery and cause blood to flow backwards
The vomiting from below will make the breath smell like vinegar, and will corrupt the gums, and will cause disgust towards the ailments that are in the mouth, and it is better than phlebotomy of the alimentary veins that are in the armpits
The vomiting which is fruitful over the two spatulas confers to captan, which is fruitful for the repletion of heat.
And the vomiting from under the ribs towards the flanks of the ribs confounds the phlebotomy of three veins, that is of the vein of the bile, of the vein of the spleen and of the cephalic vein, because those which accompany the blood from all the veins that are above remain in the trunk, and those smaller veins of the other veins which are more gross enter until they reach the attraction of the three veins.
And we command the windwarder not to proceed too far in the sacrifice, for the location is stripped of flesh, and the nerves and arteries remain there
And this is a vomiting that is made with wine and it confers to the swellings of the buttocks and to the ulcers below.
And we command the windwarder that it be a great vomiting, and that it be of wine, for it digests with great heat; and that it be offered with a great sacrifice
The greater vomiting of the legs from the lesser indicates that it expels the blood of the whole body, and it confers to the ancient pains of the kidneys and of the bladder, and to the vesicles; and it brings on the menses, and it confirms vomiting, and it is better than phlebotomy of two veins, and of the spleen, and of the liver.
But do not make it excessive in all the body, for it will cause fainting in many people.
And the vomiting which is in the morning is very useful because it is similar to the vomiting of the two veins.
The quality of the position of the vomiting is that it stops the vomiting at the beginning of the meal and lets it out gradually, and do not prolong the position of the vomiting, but rather pause them leisurely, and remain there cautiously, and that the humors come to the place by themselves without forcing them. And do not stop doing this until you see that the place has already recovered and has swelled and that the vomit has become strong
And when you have sacrificed and iterated the vomiting a little at a time, and you have considered the condition of the body.
For the gentle person who has soft flesh on his hands, command that you give him a little wine and do not give him more, for the place is not to be ulcerated
And command the windwarder to expand the sacrifice and loosen a little, and to breathe slowly.
And if there is thickness in the blood, then command that you give two wines, for in the first wine the passage of the subtle blood to the blood and the water of the blood is opened And in the second one to the scrutiny of the acquisition of the thick blood
And if the blood is not fruitful, then command that the third wine be sacrificed for it to achieve the end.
And finally, when we want to extract the blood a little at a time or a little, suffice with a small sacrifice.
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we sacrifice with a great sacrifice; and if we know that the blood is thick, then we command that we sacrifice for a greater sacrifice
The depth of the scarification is only in the codena.
If the codena is large, hard, tough, and has rough hairs, let the edges of the wound be softened with oil; if in summer, thus with oil of aloes or violets, or oil of marigolds, or almond oil; if in winter, then oil of marigold, or oil of lily, or chamomile oil, or saffron oil.</end_of_turn>
If the wound is large and purulent, let oil of amaranth, or balsam oil, or aloes oil, or anise oil be used; and so on.</end_of_turn>
Perhaps if the wound is of great extent and of tough hair, let it be prohibited to use oil, and let the edges of the wound be cleansed with vinegar or cold water, or with alum or with rose water.</end_of_turn
And if the wound has moisture, cleanse the wound with vinegar or water of mint, rue, and similar.</end_of_turn>
And if the wound is full of pus, cleanse the wound with strong vinegar or water of alum, or decoction of anise, or chamomile, or saffron.</end_of_turn
Let the wound be covered before it is washed; having washed it once or twice, let it be covered with a bandage for an hour or two, and let the wound rest.</end_of_turn
What should be done so that the wound does not bleed during dressing?
Consider at the beginning: if the wound is cold and that which gives the phlebotomist is bilious and affects the wound strongly and inflammation, it is necessary to prevent any cooling causes, thus with many vinegar and lettuce, and alum, and salt, and chamomile, and saffron.</end_of_turn>
And suspend meat dishes thus as poultry, and fish of all sizes, and dishes with bitter herbs, and give them only sweet things.</end_of_turn
And if the wound is purulent, let them drink slippery wine or slippery barley broth, and rue, and fragrant herbs like marjoram between wheat and barley; and let them be advised to eat little and drink little, and abstain from meat dishes like poultry and fish and peas and beans.</end_of_turn
And let them drink more wine than food in the days of dressing and phlebotomy.</end_of_turn>
And let them abstain from strong drinks in a few hours before and after dressing or phlebotomy, in order that the main members may be comforted and that the wound be softened; and do not let them take garlic or onions.</end_of_turn
However the wounds which are to be sacrificed must be of those that are on the flank and the heel, on the belly and the ankle, on the flanks, in the armpits, because in these places the sacrifice will not cause them any suffering.</end_of_turn
And it is not desired for these but for the attraction of the limb's disease, thus as it stops the flow of blood from the limb to the navel; and they use this to dissolve the excessive cold of the limb, thus as it stops over the belly and the navel; because that softens the limb and causes it to swell and relieves the pain which comes from the cold.</end>
And it is finished concerning the wounds when they happen in their boiling or purulent state, for by their attraction it brings forth a great boiling and expels the pus from its place.</end>
And in the same way it is done when it is stopped over the flank and the heel, it should be stopped over the belly and the ankle to remove the cold from those areas.</end
These wounds are administered only with vinegar; and some are administered with oil as well.</end
And some are administered with lukewarm water in the diseases of the belly.</end
And this is for making the wound full and great, so as to be lukewarm water alone or water in which suitable herbs are boiled.</end<end_turn>
Method of administering the wound with oil: the breadth of the opening is two fingers; the quantity of oil is like that of a palm; and it is to be applied around the circumference, like the quantity that can be held by a needle.</end>
Sia fayta de eram rog o citri, de grosses marges, leon, enguals e terses per so que no leda le membre deves la sua posicio sobre lu.
And let the physician see the vein transversely of yellow or iron, where the candle is fixed at the fire.
And already let the wind be greater of that which we have recommended; and the little warmth of that according to the diseases and the state of that whom we serve
And the winds of the elderly and extend so others than the winds of the young and of great age
And the quality of stopping this wind with fire on the limb is that it extends the marrow with fire of decent wood giving a little candle of wax, and stopping that on the vein transverse in the middle of the wind, so that the fire is kindled around the parts that are not on fire so that it is not consumed by the fire of the disease
Then let it be stopped on the limb of the patient, and let him be told what we have told him, until when we have the winds and we do not need to tell him that they are going to go away and that the vapor is going to rise from that wound, the wind will be so much dispersed.
And quickly ignite the marrow according to its manner, and repeat that if you do not digest from that.</start_of_turn>
More in the wind that is administered in the disease of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse vein or wound, and it is not administered except that it is full of water, and it is stopped only on the limb alone.</start_of_turn>
And this is its form: And this wind the greater it is, the better, for that it receives a great quantity of water.</start_of_turn
The end.
Blood does not circulate in all limbs but in the limbs in which it is not possible to position veins, because of the smallness of those, as well as the thumb and little finger and the nails; or in limb denuded of flesh, as it is said of the nose and when the nails resemble.</start_of_turn
And the quality of using those which you have found in the waters of poppyseed muddies.</start_of_turn
And let them be left lying down day and night in poppyseed muddies until they are faint, and that no remains any cause in the belly of those; and let it be evacuated from the body in the beginning with a flebotomy and with winds; and let the limb of the patient be cooled down until it turns red; and let them be stopped on it.</start_of_turn
And when they are full and calm.</start_of_turn
And if it is possible to drain the cavity with the wind, it is better later in healing.</start_of_turn
And if not, then let the cavity be washed with warm vinegar and add some more water; and let it be washed and squeezed out.</start_of_turn
And if the course of the healing is prolonged, add some lead to the vinegar, and let that be placed over until the residue is gone.</start_of_turn
And if the healing is multiplied, let there be powdered over it vitriol thrice ground, or eggs and that resemble their causes stiptics, until the healing is complete; or let it be stopped on the limb the masses of beeswax scraped out, and let them be left until the beeswax adheres to the limb, and the healing is complete.</start_of_turn
And if necessary, repeat the bloodletting, when it is possible to change those.</start_of_turn
And if bloodletting is prohibited from suspension, then let the cavity be washed with the recent blood or leave a needle in the cavity until the healing has taken place; and let it be stopped, for those will feel some sensation of healing as soon as they feel some sensation of healing.</start_of_turn
And when you want to close, sprinkle over those a little of powdered aloe or salt or ash, and cover well.</start_of_turn
Thus ends the third part: restoration.</start_of_turn This chapter is very useful necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fracture and dislocation of the bones.</start_of_turn
Oh, son of you who rejoice over this chapter the learned doctors and the vulgar people and those who at some time do not remember the ancients or do not read their letters.</start_of_turn
For this reason, the methods of these scientists on our land are a private matter; and I have never forgotten it at any time since; and I have not published anything about it until now, except after studying the works of the Ancients and researching the understanding of those, until I had extracted the science from them.
And I have added experiments and studies to this length of my life.
And I have already mentioned in this chapter all that pertains to my science and the experiments I have conducted on this; because I have abridged what I have said to you before and spared you the details; and I have brought them together at the end of the abbreviation; and I have shown you in the end of the declaration what forms of treatments are administered in this case, as it is stated in addition to the declaration, just as I have done in the two previous chapters
Chapter First
A summary and collection of the fractures of the bones, from which the preceding preface is necessary, before we begin to remember the fractured limbs and the various affections of each one Therefore, in this chapter we will speak of the summaries of the speech; and the chapters that follow relate to the understanding of those things which in the beginning were forced to the artifices and to remain in the truth of those; so you and those who are skilled in this art will know or learn this noble science from me
Therefore I say that when an accident occurs to an arm, a dislocation, a twisting or a wound, the hour covers that you should immediately apply a ligature or support that part, or whatever else, if you do not prevent any cause, even if it is due to an injury, or if that which has happened is an infant, or an old person in decrepitude, or if it is a time of violent heat, or violent cold.
And we must take care in food to eat herbs and fresh vegetables and fish of fowl and crabs; and we must prohibit large meats and fatty foods and all food that fills the veins of the sick, except if you are certain of its safety, and if you do not fear the effusion of matter from the limb.
And the hour returns the patient to their first seat where they usually sit.
Therefore, when the broken bone begins to be restored, the hour covers that the patient should not be given nourishing foods of large quantity and weight, such as broths made of flour with water, broth, eggs, fish, calves' brains, blood, turnips, peas, and large vegetables, because in this regimen there is a beneficial coagulation of the fracture more quickly and gently
You must know that bones that are fractured in the home are in the first degree of violence and in the decrepit, it is not possible that they should continue and be consolidated according to their nature because of the drying out of the limbs.
However, nature itself adjusts and remembers that every fractured bone in any part whatsoever, which has increased in size that adheres and strengthens that which is together until it is congealed and bound together, until the end of its suffering and rest, just as fire at the beginning, except that no cause prevents that from its works
Therefore it is necessary that you stop feeding the patient foods that are heavy and viscous and large, as we have said above
You must know that the species of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limb, for example, the fracture of the bone of the thigh is different from the fracture of the bone of the head; and the fracture of the bone of the foot is different from the fracture of the bone of the forearm; and similarly all the others are diverse among them
And I remember from all the species of fracture, which are exposed in the separate chapters of this book.
Many different fractures in themselves are made. And they are diversified in the species of fracture of the bone in themselves; for example, a curved fracture is different from one that occurs in the stars; and some fractures are caused by a long bone: and these include fractures of the hip, ankle and elbow, which are caused both by violent and non-violent means, just as it is said in the lament when writing is prepared, and it is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and it is a slight fracture
And each species is an own pain or discomfort in the restoration of the limb according to what will be remembered in the different places.
Motion signal of bone fracture. And thus is known as a fracture of the bone: it is twisting of the limb, and from that protrusion and prominence of the limb to the feeling, and so from it when one compresses it with your hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent twisting of the limb nor is it suspected to be a fracture, do not touch the bone immediately when you touch it, for the patient does not experience great pain; for there is no fracture here.
There is also the possibility of slight twisting or a small fracture, whereupon you do not need to press on it with your hand or compress it; there should be a pause here concerning the medicines of which you remember; and immediately apply that which seems appropriate at that moment.
And you know that when the limb is bent and is not broken in two or otherwise that does not cause it to swell up throughout, as is remembered in general throughout its part, then it is necessary to commence immediately to rectify it when it has happened, because of the following day
If it swells up the following day, then leave it for some days until the swelling has gone down; and then apply whatever method you can to lift and support it
And you know that the restoration of the limb and its elevation is lighter than the bone from which the swelling comes.
And thus remember what has been said.
More especially if in the bone there are swellings, it is necessary to extend this limb fractured from two parts, whether it be the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two strings or one string and your hand.
And keep your position so that the limb lies naturally, while the fractured parts are extended from the limb, so that you can return those attachments with the hand and in whatever way you can to their places.
And take care that you do not cause further pain or damage to the patient during your operation; and apply your force as you are able to one bone with the other companion in many different ways
And take advantage at that moment of your touch with your hand, and if sometimes there is some other cause, rectify that and support that to the extent of your ability
Avoid excessive extension and compression, just as many learned doctors do who make the swelling go down with their treatment or cause constriction of the limb in the course of their treatment of their patients
The quality of the stricture of the limb is that which I recommend; for you know that fractured limbs are diverse in their size and shape.
And as for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the wrist, and similar to those, the covering should be of soft material
And as for those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, cover those with firm and hard covering, which connects the great limb firmly and strengthens the whole limb in its entirety, without causing any bruising
And thus commence, make your evacuation of equipment ready, and place the convenient bandage on the place of that fracture with three coverings or four as the limb deserves; and strengthen your hand a little on the ligament.
And look at the part furthest from the fracture, and strengthen less than you have strengthened the fracture site itself.<end_turn> And gradually lengthen the covering of the fracture site, and soften the stricture little by little until you can remove the part of the limb that has healed well.<end_turn>
And thus take another bandage and cover that bandage over the fractured limb with the covering, and look at the covering towards the end of the fracture; and do your operation concerning the stricture of the covering and the softening of that as we said in the first covering.<end_turn
If there is a swelling or fracture that causes pain, and if in it there is pain; pause in it until the swelling has gone down; otherwise do not pause in it for any reason.
If there is no swelling or fracture, pause over the other thing, and cover these loose covering adequately until there is neither swelling nor pus coming out of it. When there is pus coming out of it and swelling, leave that for a while; and when there is neither swelling nor pus coming out of it, keep the covering on it.</end_of_turn>
And if it is of hemp or flaxseed, let the width of each strap be known; or if it is of leather or palm leaves, let the width of each strap be as follows: ...</end_of_turn>
But cover that the strap which is placed over that fracture is thicker and narrower than the others, and the length of the strap according to the size of the limb; and strengthen over the straps with another thing according to your first order; and keep it firm in place according to what we have said of order, that is, that it should be as strong as the fracture itself, and the more the fracture is elongated, the weaker the order.</end_of_turn>
But cover that the threads should be of medium thickness and fineness, and of silk; and if the threads are coarse, thus it has been seen in the operation of many fools who have left the order during the stitching, and that is a great error, when the order is not equal.</end_of_turn
And fine threads are not convenient, because you will not achieve strength in the order with those that you wish, and do not cover that there should be less than a finger between the straps.</end_of_turn>
And if the patient is suffering from the extremities of the bones, pause the order until those of hemp or linen have been taken out of the place where they do harm.</end_of_turn
Some doctors call fracture a wound, and accident a disruption of the tendon, and I remember that in the capitol there is a singular thing.</end_of_turn
And know that a broken limb is not immediately straightened with the straps on the first day; the reason for which is that when the limb is great, it does not cover that you should pause over the straps but rather after a few days or eight or ten, according to your security of the coming out of pus.</end_of_turn
This is the way in which the ancient restored the limbs, who paused over fracture, dislocation and twist.</end_of_turn>
Method of dressing as used for the restoration of fractures, convenient for many complex and mostly for women and men, because it is of that from which neither heat nor cold escapes: and take powder of millet, which is the kernel of wheat that hangs behind the movement of the husk in the belly of the millet.</end_of_turn
And keep that thus, but if there is album of blood, stop the bleeding of it that is not thick or viscous; and use that for that.</end_of_turn
Another way of dressing is for fracture, dislocation and twisting: recipe of asphalt, lapdanum, acacia, enula, and marigold, which is ground from a thousand grains of saffron, by five drachs; of myrrh and aloes by five; of alum by twenty. All these are triturated and sifted and mixed with water or with egg white if the patient's wound is raw; and use this dressing, which is of good composition and strengthens the broken bones immediately, and gives confidence to the people.</end_of_turn
Another way of dressing which is useful for fracture and twisting: recipe of marigold and white alum by five drachs; of myrrh and aloes by five; of acacia by six; of chamomile by two.
All things are pounded in mortar with mortar inside, and they are sifted, and they are made comfortable with water or with glue of oil and are administered.
Treatment for joint pain and separated bones at these locations, and for pain in these and in fissures and fractures: take dry lancets and immerse them in vinegar and oil and apply over the area.</end_of_turn>
In this plaster there is no virtue of restoration, of evacuation of pus, but it expels pain properly.</end_of_turn>
Another method of plastering that restores the fracture: take figs and poppyseed leaves; mix them up and make plaster of them.</end_of_turn>
Method of short plastering administered after restoration of bone fracture and when you want resolution of the remaining pus: mix parsley, chamomile and violets flowers, barley flour, and all together.</end_of_turn> Everything is pounded and made comfortable with wine, if the limb is not scorched.</end_turn>
If it is scorched, then comfort it with lukewarm water of colander or with water and use it.</end_turn
Another method of plastering that is more solid in resolution than the previous one, when the abscess is firm, you must restore the limb: mix parsley, linseed seeds, barley, meadowsweet, marjoram, violets flowers, chamomile, and all together; pound them and make them comfortable with vinegar or other liquid or wine, according to the quality of the limb and the degree of its color.</end_turn
Ipocras does not say that in the free belly it should be placed over the fractured limb except when a certain amount of wax and oil is made and no other cause; and I recommend that it be better between thickness and thinness.</end_turn
Moreover, in Guinea it is seen that it should be placed over the fractured limb after the restoration of it and the causes in which it is exsiccated with little heat so as not to cause like mercury, cinnamon and nutmeg to do to them from those causes that we have recommended.</end_turn
Method of plastering that comforts the lesion and pain: mix millet, hazelnuts, ground poppy seeds or pepper of owl, parsley, salt, and ground beeswax; pound them and sift them and make plaster, and make a plaster.</end_turn
Moreover, the amount according to which it should cover the binding and when it should be dissolved, is that you consider if there is neither excessive pain nor swelling nor the bone is fractured not to make it worse by its location, for when you do not remove it for a long time.</end_turn And if it happens at the location of acute pain or swelling or inflammation, when you should cover it or remove it at the time, and keep the plaster on it.</end_turn
And take sponge of lint and wet marine sponge, and immerse it in lukewarm water, and with that wash the area until the swelling and pain are gone; and then lay the limb still for an hour; and then place over it dry lancets immersed in vinegar and oil or scented oil, and bind over it for a night until you are sure that the abscess has gone down, and that the swelling of the limb has ceased, and that the pain has gone away.</end_turn
And do the same with that stricture and make the plaster small and do not tighten it for your primary constriction, and leave it until it is healed.</end_turn
And if sometimes the abscess, the redness, the pain, the swelling and all these accidents have already passed, and digestion of plaster and stricture is not necessary, when you do it as you did at the beginning when you put on the plaster.</end_turn
And if no other cause occurs to the limb of those that we have said, do not remove it until three or four days or five or seven days.</end_turn and some say that everything that is left must be left for xx days according to your appearance for the healing of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture is healed, and the coagulacion of the marrow over that.</end_turn
And adjust in the stricture more than in your primary stricture throughout, and adjust in the nourishment of the patient's food, according to the memory of it.</end_turn
Moreover, if sometimes the location of the fracture has already dried out and expanded more than that which covers it, know that the nourishment is prohibited from going there; and therefore mix that with lukewarm water throughout the whole meal that you will give it; and do this for three days; and loosen the stricture a little, and for this operation take nourishment to the limb, and it will be healed quickly.</end_turn></end_of_turn>
More than that which fools restore the fracture of the limb that has been neglected from the beginning, according to custom, is to restore it crookedly; for this is an error according to their operation, and great fear, and if it should be prolonged, it makes the ancients angry in their leisure and they will be angry with you for your work.
And I have never seen anyone do this who does not think it is better not to do it
Chapter: On fracture when it occurs in the head
The species of fractures are multiple, and their figures are diverse, and their causes are different, for some fractures are caused by the percussion of space, and the percussion hinders all the bones within the cavity, which is left with the bone, as happens in the forearm, and for this reason this kind is called traumatic; or the space penetrates any part of the bone, and penetrates the marrow but does not pass through the back of the bone; and this kind of fracture is called absolute elevation
And the plague of these two fractures is great or little, and the fracture that is crooked or twisted; and the cause of these is percussion with soft or hard material, and they seem to linger
And this fracture is penetrating which has already approached the nerve which is left with the bone; or it is on the face of the bone, and the plague of these two fractures is great or little
And fracture is that which is hidden in the bone, in the substance of the small vessel, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called capillary
And this is a fracture which is caused either by violence or by percussion of stone and it persists, which makes every layer of the bone penetrate the parts adjacent, and is fatal in the concave place just as when it occurs in the heel when it is percussioned and a part of it enters the adjacent parts
And most of all it is fatal in the joints of humiferous bones, as well as in their heads of bone marrow
And with all these kinds of fractures, it is necessary to break up the surrounding pieces as if they were separated stars And I come to regret all that is in this place
And I know all these kinds of fractures by recognition on them and by their signs and symptoms and the corruption of the marrow that is over them
The capillary fracture is known because it is discovered on the bone, and is stripped away, and is limited above by a tent which makes the fracture black.
More than anything in the treatment of fractures one must take into consideration the accidents of the patient, and when sometimes for the accidents that signify by their manifestation on the patient means fear, such as vomiting of bile, and extension, and loss of understanding, and loss of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and even the yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the stench of these, and if these do not disappear, he is not well.
And if sometimes the accidental symptoms do not recur, you hope for health, the hour you begin the treatment of them
The cause of which is that if it is provoked at the beginning like that which is provoked in the days of autumn, the hour you must study in the marrow of the bone from the fourteenth day according to every custom
And if it is in the summer days, the hour you must keep the bone still from the seventh day, having to ensure that what is left of the bone is corrupted from the nerve, and that the symptoms which we have recommended appear
And if the fracture has already reached the nerve covering the brain, and is split into small pieces and twisted, the hour you must insert the split piece and cauterize, as I have recommended to you
And you must take his head in hand who has the illness, and discover about the bone according to custom and handle him as you think best according to the figure of the illness, and be curious about the patient
And if it happens to you that you discover the bone, flux of blood or caut abscess, the hour you oppose it with what you think is right, that you cover the area with wet cloths in oil and anoint with rosemary, and apply the plaster to the wound until the abscess has subsided; and be sure to drain the blood; and begin treatment by surrounding the bone and removing the bone.
And this is according to two methods of operation.
And one method is to insert the bone with a straight incision, and this is how it is done: And then administer another incision which is a little wider than the first; and this is how it is done:
E aprop administra mays le inscissori pus lat que·l segon.
And know that you must call by name various medicines, some of which are more bitter than others; and some of them are shorter than others and are at the back of the degree of their sharpness, and they are made of iron or are venomous.</end_of_turn>
And use them easily in percussion on the medicine so that you do not bruise the head and damage that.</end_of_turn
And if it is strong and hard, know that you must pierce in the course of them beforehand that you administer the medicines while they travel, which are called superficial not deep.</end_of_turn
And they are not called thus except when those that are around the bone stop at the end of it, so that when they travel the extremity is round or slightly above that which leaves the head of the bone like a margin or a small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the substance of the bone.</end_of_turn>
And it is convenient that you take from these superficial travels a great number of those that seem to agree with the substance of each bone, except when in all tests of the brain the extremity that is acute is present, in which case the quantity in length and breadth should be according to the quantity of substance of that test.</end_of_turn
And this is the form of three kinds of superficial travels: The quality of piercing in the circuit of the fractured bone is that you pause the travel on the bone and rotate that around with the thumbs until you know that the bone has already been pierced; and then change the sponge to another place and leave that which is between every break the quantity of the thickness of the ray or withdraw that.</end_of_turn
And finally give more bitter medicines than before.
And know that you must take great care that the medicine does not touch any cause of diarrhea.</end_of_turn>
And therefore when you have pierced the bone, and if it is continued with it, extract that and know that you must take that out with the scraping of the bone like another medicine, more truly and more subtly than the others.</end_of_turn
And if there remains any small parts of the bones and fragments, know that you must take that out with ease with what is due to you from the sufferings; and then care for the wound with lint and ointment as we have said.</end_of_turn
And another way of operating is light, long and laborious, which is to dissect Gualia and the lauzec for great pleasure; and this is their saying: It is necessary for you at the beginning to uncover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most violent and most obvious, until when you have uncovered that part and have left it the extremity of that medicine slow and leisurely of which this is the form:
And that the blunt part is round and does not touch any cause, and the acute part is of it in two planes forward and backward, as sometimes; that the blunt part is adjusted to the diarrhea with the face of the acute part that is incident on the bone.</end_of_turn
And finally give more bitter medicines than before. And know that you must take great care that the medicine does not touch any cause of diarrhea. And when you have pierced the bone with a small instrument until you have inserted all the bone with ease as it is rotated, you must be sure of the safety that it does not happen by chance that something similar happens in any way, and if the physician was the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he was asleep.</end_of_turn>
And if there remains any other adjacent cause to the bone in those places of the bone, the former will be with the extremity of the medicine blunt, and the latter will be facilitated, which is delirious from it without any document and without any fear.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the canal, and what is fractured or remains of the bone is the face of it, and remains in it asperities and subtle fragments, know that you must scrape that asperity and extract those fragments with subtle reasons for those for which you have prepared the number, of various quantities so that you can easily administer them in all places and the most useful of them according to what you lose in your operation that broken bone and its figure.</end_of_turn
And know that you must administer at your leisure the amount of those reasons with which the bone starts the most bitter of all those reasons, and finally use more of the subtle of them, and do not stop doing that until you have administered the most bitter and the most subtle of all of them.</end_of_turn
May in any of the other small fractures or cracks, cover that you administer care as it is necessary to rectify them.
It is because it is not known about all of them that have studied in that art And this is what has been shown to us in great fractures
If the swelling is rectangular when you extract the bone, then cover that you take hold of it according to the quantity of the wound, and immerse that in scented oil, and place that over the orifice of the wound; and take another pad doubled or tripled and immerse it in wine and oil, and place that over the first pad and make that the oil comes out of that wound without damaging it; and immediately administer about that ligament lime juice, and do not tighten that until the wound is only as wide as the wound alone.
And leave that thus for a day or two until you are sure of its stability; and then remove that and administer medicines which are useful for drying, such as rue seed and oatmeal, and poppyseed and alum, and similar to these.
And that you grind these medicines into a powder that is spread over the wound; and universally, administer any medicine that has the property of drying and not biting
Observe carefully that the wound in your care is dry; and do not put anything greasy on it; neither let any wickedness remain in it; for when it is adjusted on the bone of the skull, it corrupts that and weakens that, and causes harm to the patient immediately
And in the head, as in all other bones, when the care is weakened and the bone is softer, and is blackish on the surface; and therefore consider that if an accident occurs to the patient at this time, the things that we have said are sufficient to prevent all of that.
And if no blackening occurs except for the medicine that is being discontinued, and it is in virtue of that medicine that caused that blackening, then cover that you take two parts of that medicine and three parts of scented oil. And mix with that a sponge, and place that over the wound; and take care of that with the spices of care that you consider until it is healed
Chapter III
Of the restoration of the nose when it is fractured
Know that the nose is not fractured but rather two fragments which are somewhat united by the surrounding soft parts, for in it there are two bones, and the part that is left is cartilaginous and is not fractured and does not cause it any harm except for swelling and pain and bruising
When one of the two fragments is fractured, then cover that you introduce little by little in the nose, and that you stabilize that fracture as much as possible, and as much as the force, until the nose returns to its natural shape And be careful that you do not cause any pain for your patient during this operation.
And if the fracture is at the upper part of the nose, and you say that it is not for that, then cover that it is equal to the extent of the ray in which the thickness is small
And if the fracture is in two fragments, then do as above
Keep the restoration of it in the first day of the fracture if possible; and if not, cover that you give it a rest of eight or nine days before resuming the care of the cautery.
And put into the extremity of the nose a bandage of lead, if the fracture is in one part, or two cushions, if the fracture is in two parts, and of such size that it fills the cavity of the nose
And tell the old restorers that the cushions should be bound over, and be changed throughout the day, although I do not see it; because it has to be covered with an ointment of lead with powdered gypsum; and do not leave the cushion on until the bone is fixed and the cartilage is solidified
And many people put sponges in the nose instead of a cushion, because it is better than covering it with lead; and that the fracture of the nose is already violent and that the patient should not be prohibited from inspiration
This is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do one thing, or do the other thing.
And if another sponge comes loose after the cautery, cover the nose with earth or pack it with wine vinegar and scented oil, or with alum.
May it be that if the burn does not happen after the cautery, then it covers that it is placed over flour of the size of barley and powder of burnt herbs with an album of oil; and it pauses over it to stop the lion, and do not leave it exposed for any reason.
If the bones of the nose are fractured slightly or broken, then it covers that you score over them, and extract them with the instruments that are suitable for them; and then close the wound, and care for that which encloses and consolidates, and over which you place what is convenient
And if there is a wound in the nose, then it covers that you cure that which is around it and administer lead tubes until it is completely healed.
The treatment is complete for the time being.
Restoration of the jaw when it is fractured
When the jaw is fractured and the fracture is not associated with a wound, it is necessary that if the fracture is lateral only, and is not fractured in two and is curved inwards, the cognizance is slight.</start_of_turn>
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you insert the middle finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; in the same way if the fracture is on the left jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand; and push with that the swelling of the fracture inwards towards the outside, with your other hand over the outside of the bone; in this way you will equal that side.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two, then it covers that you administer extension of the two parts according to the rectitude until it is possible to equal them.</start_of_turn
And if there is movement of teeth with disruption, then stretch those which you hope will remain intact with gold or silver or gutta percha; and place over the fractured jaw a strip of silk or a piece of gutta percha, and place over the great pulp the silk that is conveniently suitable; and tie that which is sufficient to hold it in place, until it is not destroyed.</start_of_turn
And command the patient to rest and be tranquil, and abstain from eating of coarse foods.</start_of_turn>
And if you observe that the figure has already been altered in any way, then you cover yourself and remove it on the third day; and then rectify what has already been altered of it and plaster that which has remained with powder of wheat, with an album of oil, or with barley flour, because you have already given it enough of that, and place over the plaster a lion's skin.</start_of_turn
And when it is fixed and adjusted that plaster over it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it in place, do not remove it until it is healed and strengthen the fracture; for it is observed that this fracture is stretched in three measures.</start_of_turn
And if another wound happens after the cautery, then administer what has been said about the sensation in the delay until it is healed, and remove that wound.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is associated with a wound, then consider if it is a separated fragment or fragments, then you are ordered to retain those fragments with what is convenient for the removal of those which cause the torment.</start_of_turn
And if the wound is straight, then you expand it with the flebotomy according to the amount of your necessity.</start_of_turn
And when you have finally retained those fragments, and of those you will not remove any, then you close the wound if it is wide; and if not, place over that one of the plasters that is convenient and consolidate that, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
The treatment is complete in this case.</start_of_turn>
Restoration of the thyroid when it is fractured.</start_of_turn
The fracture of the thyroid is caused by the tension of the muscle behind it, and that fracture is made in three ways.</start_of_turn
Because either it is fractured, or separated, or is separated into two parts without causing fragments; and it is curious about the restoration of it; or that in it has caused fragments, and it is difficult to restore it; or that the fracture is associated with a wound.</start_of_turn
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is associated with a wound, is that you must have two assistants, so that one holds the fractured thyroid and the other extends the collar towards that part.</start_of_turn
And cover the fracture with the threads mentioned until the shape is restored according to what is covered, and not too high or too low.</start_of_turn
If digestion is insufficient, then stop the patient's shivering with a warm compress or a blanket, and adjust the size of the compress according to the degree of their need; extend and elevate the head and cover the body with your hand until the fracture is fully healed.
If it is not possible to move the limb away from the wound, in order that it does not cause further pain, then cover the patient's face with a cushion and place a cushion under the muscle on the side of the wound
The attendants hold the limb away from the wound until the bone of the fracture is elevated above the wound site, and then you can straighten the fracture and cover what is inside with your fingers.
Even if sitting with the fracture and so much pain, cover that area and extract those sattages with ease
And if it is retained in the bone, make an incision of the limb with one of the instruments which you have prepared for this purpose, because you have already stopped the fracture from causing damage to the skin; the cause of this damage is either swelling or bruising.
It is similar to the shape of a hernia; and let the width of the incision be according to what you need of it, according to the size of the bone or the thinness of the tissue.
Let the length of the incision be as you are able for the operation; that there be two limbs as many times as necessary, one wide and the other narrow
And if the disruption of the membrane which you have incised when you have extracted the swelling from the bone is wide, and you are sure of the hemostasis, then you adjust the two edges of the wound with sutures
And if the disruption is slight, or if you fear hemostasis, then you can close the wound with cloth and powder according to the extent of the wound
And if there is bleeding from the cautery, then immerse the limb in wine vinegar and olive oil and hold it over the area.
And in general, do not be afraid to remove the splint over the fractured bone; and so that you can see the patient every day, because when the ligament is softened or when the splint is already softened, then you can straighten it out again and strengthen the bandage.
And put the patient in a position where the patient's legs are supported by the bed, and keep the patient's hands elevated about the level of the fracture; or keep the patient's arm bound to the bedpost
Do not remove the dressing if there is no bleeding or infection, until at least twelve days have passed.
Renew the dressing if you see the wound again, and straighten the fracture and restore it when the swelling has gone down and the fracture of the bone has coagulated.</end_of_turn>
It is strengthened and comfortable in about twenty-eight days, and some walks on crutches are sufficient in a month of that time.
End of document.
Treatment for fractures of the ankle.
The bone is fractured in the lateral part of the limb and not throughout the limb.
And therefore when it is fractured in the middle of the limb — and it is only fractured in the middle of the limb — and it is not known except by touch, then follow the figure of the fracture in order to prepare it and reduce it as much as possible in the natural way
And put on a compress of fine flour and eggshell powder with a sponge; and put on a sheet of linen and cover with another sponge.
Even if the sponge is somewhat concave in some parts of the wound, then you can cover that concavity with the sponge and support the splint equally
And thus stretch down their limb with a long handle from the constriction downwards until it does not yield from the heel bone.
Consider the ligament in each day; and whenever it is softened, join another soft one and stretch it equal to the heel if it yields from the heel bone
And I grasp the patient over the ankle bone like that
And the spatula is restored in xx days or in .xxv.
And thus when this number is completed, then dissolve the ligament, and know that what has been from the bones from which it began is not to be feared or dissolved
And if you proceed from the foot bone and place the tendon below, then split over it, and leave it, and do as we have said in the fracture of the collarbone of the scapula after post-traumatic cautery if it happens here.
Chapter .vii.</start_of_turn>
Of the restoration of the fracture of the foot bone.</start_of_turn>
The bones of the foot are often fractured in the middle of the bone and there; may the extremities of it move forward that so cicatrices and diminished.
And as for the accidents of it when the middle of the bone is fractured, it is that it leans downwards to the inner parts and causes great pain, and difficulty in walking, and sneezing, and vomiting almost; and it is declared in the cavity of the fractured bone and is not hidden from the feeling.</start_of_turn
And the restoration of it is that you rest the patient over the two ankles, and put between the heels of the patient a cushion; and then press on the muscles of the foot, and adjust the ribs of the foot to the greatest of two ribs, and support them in the operation of the foot and in the equalization as much as is possible and convenient, until you restore the shape of the bone as it was before.</start_of_turn
And thus pause over the dressing and bandage and pause over the plaster of lime or of lead and keep them in suspension, as they seem to be floating; and cover that with a bandage; and support that which is above the fractured bone so that it is not painful; and gradually stretch that which is strict downwards; and consider the ligament in every hour, and when it is softened stretch that.</start_of_turn
And if necessary to provoke the loosening of that, you must correct the bruising or swelling or pain or post-traumatic loosening that occurs in the place; then you should cover that and remove that and rectify what has happened by the manner of treatment of it; and then reduce the plaster, sometimes to the point that the face is reduced; and adjust the stricture until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter .viii.</start_of_turn
Of the restoration of the ribs when they are fractured.</start_of_turn
You must know that the fracture of the ribs does not usually cause pain except in the parts which follow two; and as for the extremities of them from the front they do not cause to those surrounding them anything except for what is cartilaginous.</start_of_turn And you must know that it is not hidden from the feeling that the inquiry of them must be made.</start_of_turn
And the restoration is in this way that it embraces the fracture as it is said above according to the possibility, except that it is embraced as much as is convenient, and then support the fractured bone with a plaster, if you wish.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture of the ribs is leaning downwards to the inner parts, then immediately the patient suffers acute pain and puncturing, just as if it were a puncture that happened to that which has pleura, and for that reason it has the bone covered with a membrane; and it causes difficulty in swallowing, and sneezing, and vomiting almost; and this is a difficult healing.</start_of_turn
And already the Ancients have devised in that matter an ingenious thing.</start_of_turn
And thus they say: cover that which causes the patient to eat and drink that engenders swelling and wind, so that the belly is not swollen and is extended, and the fracture is fixed to the parts outside.</start_of_turn
May we avoid that because of that it is not the cause of causing post-traumatic caut, if not; and if it has already happened, then it helps that.</start_of_turn
And I say to you that it should be stopped from the wind and that you should make it with fortitude; and it is like reasoning, however, it is feared that the wind will draw out the humors from the place for the fracture.</start_of_turn
And he said to them: cover the wound with a bandage which is already submerged in oil, and sprinkle powder between the ribs until it is full, so that the ligature may be even when it encloses that which is round about; and do cure the disease with the care of food and medicine.
And if it causes violent constriction of the disease which does not suffer, and if you put a needle point on the wound, remember over the disease, for when you cover the wound, uncover the fractured rib, and do place your hand over that instrument which preserves the liver, remembering that which precedes it, and that it inscribe upon them with ease, and extract that.</end_of_turn>
And do adjust the two lips of the plague, if it is great, by boiling, and cure that which is inside until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if it happens that the wound bursts, then do cover it with powdered charcoal in scented oil and place your hand over the wound, and that the disease be cured by that which covers the wound burst.</end_of_turn
And rest upon the side on which you sleep, until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter IX.
Of restoration of the fracture of the vertebra of the thigh and of the heel.</end_of_turn>
Some veins cause fracture to the bones of the heel, and start to attract them, and similarly to the vertebrae of the thigh.</end_of_turn And when such things happen to someone and you wish to know if they are healed or not, consider that sometimes the swellings are already softened and stupefying and dead and you cannot move them neither extend them nor flex them, and when you tighten them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and they do not cause pain, then you know that they are not healed, and in such a state of affairs it is deadly.</end_of_turn
And if you do that and feel pain in that tightening with your fingers and pricking, then you know that the bone is saved and the disease will go away with care.</end_of_turn
And if you see the vertebrae of the thigh like this and you wish to know if they are healed or not, then consider the pain in their feet.</end_of_turn
Then if sometimes they are already softened, it happens in those which are excessive, and when you lie down on the two thighs, you feel a breeze and egestion is its will, and many veins are lying down on the two thighs and they cannot urinate, then you know that it is deadly, and do not work on their care.</end_of_turn
May there not be any other cause of these, the cause is better and lighter.</end_of_turn
And the care of them is that you perforate the wound cautiously with a cautery which rests over the fractured vertebra, with scented oil only, or with some warm vinegar; and place your hand over that each of these veins gives blood until the wound is healed.</end_of_turn
And do place one of the soft dressings that exist on that which is liamed; and command the disease to rest and be tranquil and not to sleep on the side where it finds pain until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if it happens that you must remove the bone marrow or any cause that is already separated from it, then do cover that area with a bandage and keep that bone; and do adjust the two lips of the plague, with sutures if it is great; and do cure that which is in the belly of the wound, until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the heel bone is fractured at the end of the limb, and this is the end of the age, then do put your left hand over the buttock and grasp the fractured bone with the other hand as well as is possible; and do place your hand over that plaster or bandage, if you do not approve of them, and do tighten that.</end_of_turn
And if you feel bones fractured in this way, then do hold that above that, and keep that, and cure the wound with the care that is preceded until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter X.
Of restoration of the limb.
The bones of the limb are thus fractured, and if they fracture, then the fracture of them is only communication in the extremities of those and are inscribed in the length and decline towards the inward parts; and it happens to the disease pain in the area and puncture, and the limb is stupefazed when it is fractured.</end_of_turn
And the restoration of them is that you extend your hand over that which is over the fracture which is the shape of it.</end_of_turn
If the fracture is only at the extremity, then you should embrace that part as it is until it is reduced to its natural position.
If the fracture is in the leg or that it is already drooping downwards, then you should keep the patient comfortable by placing a bandage over the abdomen until such time as the fracture is set And thus when you have reduced that, place over it a dressing, and also place over the heel or the ankle a bandage, and tighten the bandage so that you do not fear puncturing from the fracture or removing the splinter.
Embrace the hollow part with that which fills it up so that the pressure of the bandage is equal, and command the patient to lie down on their side or sit up on their chest side
If the wound should happen afterwards, then cease the extension of the limb and the restoration of the limb until the wound has bled enough; and place over it what is necessary according to what has preceded; and then return to the restoration of the limb, and tighten that again as before
And if it should happen in the buttocks or be fractured, then treat them as well
(End of document
Note: The document ends abruptly and the last line provided is actually the heading of the next section of the treatise dealing with the restoration of fractures of the limb bones.
The adjutori is that which is between the groin and the head of the thigh bone.
And if it is fractured, the restoration of it is in two ways, of which one is to take the thigh bone flat with half of its breadth according to this manner:
And suspend it from the elevated place with two ligaments.
Keep the patient on a cushion; and gently draw out the fractured limb from the thigh until the nail of the limb reaches the middle of the thigh bone curvature
And if there is any great cause, or if the limb should hang downwards; and the physician should hold the fracture firmly in the buttock area until the fracture returns as it should
And the other way is that the patient should lie on their chest and suspend the limb from the collarbone; and command two assistants that one of them holds what is above the fracture with their hands; and the other holds the leg; and whichever of them extends it towards their part
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then tighten over the fracture with a ligament and over that with another ligament, and whichever of the two assistants extends their two parts
And if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then cover that half of the ligament over the nail and the other part the fracture from the groin
Similarly if the fracture is close to the groin, then cover that part of the ligament over that place and that part of the groin
Embrace that which is easy to grasp and rest, and when it has been reduced as it should be, tighten that which has not bled
If there should happen to be a wound from the cautery afterwards, then lay off the bandage for seven days, and put over it a soft dressing of wool and oil until the wound has healed, and then tighten that again
The way to tighten is to place a dressing over the fracture, and then put a bandage of gut over the dressing; and adjust the limb over that adjutori and place your hand over the muscle of the thigh
Rest the limb and tighten over the adjutori the arms so that the limb is in place without hindering any other cause of the fractured bone
And use crutches.
And put over the fracture that bone which is more round and strong than the others; and place between each bone the width of a finger, and the length of the bones according to the fracture plus three fingers from the tip to the base
And tighten over the bones at the fracture the one which I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter
And that your bandage over the fracture area is more tight<end_turn> And if the fracture is longer, then the bandage should be smaller<end_turn
And thus if sometimes the position of the bones and the bandage are as we have said at the time when we restored the limb to its natural position, then you should do it<end_turn>
If you fear a relapse of the cautery, then let the patient lie still for seven days as we have said.
Consider the ligaments throughout the body for three days so that they do not become inflamed in the process; or abstain from food in order that the member be devoid of surplus stricture; and thus correct all that we have said.</end_of_turn>
Even if you are confident that no other cause is present, do not remove the ligation before three days or more.</end_of_turn>
Let the patient rest on their side with their knees bent towards their chest, and their feet resting on the stomach.</end_of_turn
And pause with full coverage of greasy ointment on the wound, and consider throughout the night or day that it is not blistered or dissolved the figure of the fractured limb, or that the ligament is softened, therefore correct all this with your skill.</end_of_turn
Abstain from food for the patient according to the order that we have given before, unless food is consumed sparingly from the beginning until it is digested; and when it is eaten, cover that the food is swallowed.</end_of_turn
As for the use of the cautery and the dressing of the limb, they should be maintained for forty days; and when they are removed, bathe and medicate with the remedies that correct this.</end_of_turn
If the fracture is slight and retracted, then do not remove the ligature until the eighth day or two months.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XII.</end_of_turn>
On the restoration of a fracture of the arm.</end_of_turn
The arm consists of two bones which are called two facets; of which one is small, and is called the thumb, and the other is large and is that which is fixed from the thumb, from the part beyond the thumb.</end_of_turn
And it is strong if only the large facet is fractured, or the thumb alone; and it is strong if both are fractured together.</end_of_turn
And when the small facet is fractured outwards, the restoration of it is easier, and its healing is more delicate.</end_of_turn
And when the large facet is fractured inwards, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.</end_of_turn
And the worse of all is when both bones are fractured together.</end_of_turn
Therefore, if the fractured bone is the small facet outwards, it is convenient for the doctor to postpone the restoration, which allows for painless healing.</end_of_turn
And if the large facet is fractured inwards, cover that you pause the extension even more vehemently.</end_of_turn
And if both facets are fractured together, cover that you suspend movement as much as possible.</end_of_turn
And cover that you keep the figure of the hand still during the restoration of the limb and its extension is supported on a cushion, and that the thumb is lower than the other fingers, and the patient is placed centrally over a cushion.</end_of_turn
And let there be a cushion under the limb at the level or below it, so that the patient does not exert themselves.</end_of_turn
And let the attendants extend the arm from the part beyond the thumb towards the shoulder or towards the ligament, and another attendant extend them in the same way.</end_of_turn
And let the doctor restore the bone until it is reduced according to the best possible figure.</end_of_turn
And if there is swelling in the bone, cover that you perforate the whole foot in the ankle with your skill.</end_of_turn
And if there appears separated swelling that you do not expect to heal in the restoration, cover that you remove it according to the manner we have mentioned.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture is mild, as I have already said in this treatise, take care of it.</end_of_turn
And if a relapse of the caut occurs at the beginning of your restoration, cover that you apply a bandage of fine silk or white wax, and be more cautious between stiffness and softness, and strengthen the bandage over that which is causing the stiffness until the relapse has subsided; and then remain the bandage and pause the plaster prepared from powdered gypsum with white clay, and put on the bandage; and let the support that is placed over the fracture be stronger and more firm.</end_of_turn
The name of the bones in the arm is seen in great abundance, or a fracture in one or two bones together.
And so, restrain the limb firmly over the fracture, and when more than one fragment remains below the fracture or below the lower parts of it, restrain the limb slightly less than before, as a reminder of the situation from the beginning of the chapter
The cloths that cover the fracture should be soft and moist, not rough or dry, and the thread with which it is bound should be neither too tight nor too loose, as we have recommended.
Consider the limb and the ligament nearby for several days. And if any cause that requires rectification should arise, do so as promptly as the occurrence of the limb, and cover that you bandage the limb with cold water until the pain ceases
Leave the limb still until it has healed, and then remove the restraint
If the limb is already softened and the bone is already reunited and resembling those things, then rectify everything with your skill
Consider also if the nourishment is prohibited from reaching the limb due to excessive restraint, for it is necessary to soften that a little and leave it for several days until the nourishment returns, and strengthen that.</start_of_turn>
If no other cause of those mentioned above should occur to the patient, do not remove the dressing for about xx days or so.</start_of_turn>
And let the patient suspend their hand for their activity of movement, and make them sleep on two cushions.</start_of_turn>
You know that this fracture is restored in xxx days or in xxxii days, or the strong limb is restored in xxviii days, and all this according to the composition of the complex and the ability.</start_of_turn
Chapter XIII.</start_of_turn>
On the restoration of the fracture of the thumb and the fingers.</start_of_turn
You know that at the thumb of the hand and the joints of the fingers there must be a fracture, and that it does not occur to them except with wounds covered with a soft dressing.</start_of_turn
And when the hand is fractured or cut, it is necessary that the patient continue to hang their hand down and let it rest without moving it until the swelling subsides.
And so, the attendants extend the broken bones and the doctor should glue them together until they are well joined together with good adhesion.</start_of_turn
And it is necessary to cover the plaster and bandage, if there is no further bleeding; and so remove the pin from the limb according to the amount of swelling, and you have already covered that with a bandage.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is in the lower parts of the limb you must support the belly of the palm, and make the patient keep their hand stretched out, and command the patient to strengthen that with their palm fractured; strengthen it with the hand itself.</start_of_turn
And the bone of the limb should be supported with a bandage on the palm so that the limb is applied to the palm; strengthen it as much as it covers.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is in the outer parts, it is necessary to remove the pin from the limb and another pin from the palm side, so that the hand is open and flexible; and so restrain the limb slightly, as if rotating the hand between the fingers with the ligaments.</start_of_turn
And if a fracture occurs to some of the joints of the fingers, if it is said to be urgent, then glue it according to the coverage and strengthen it with the palm of the hand, and if you want, support the little joint of the thumb so that the fracture is elevated and not crushed.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the ring or middle or index or little finger, then glue it and bind it with the finger itself as many as are necessary; or bind them all together as a whole, which is better; or support the little pin as we have said above.</start_of_turn
Consider in your restoration, and in particular that of bleeding, the opposing and — with regard to the operation — the things that cover when any cause of those mentioned above occurs, as is repeated in the narration.</start_of_turn
Chapter XIV.</start_of_turn
On the restoration of the fracture of the thigh bone.</start_of_turn
The bone of the buttock is fractured and is declared according to the feeling as having been converted to the anterior part and to the sovereign pus.
The restoration is done in this way that the ligament is stretched over the fracture and another ligament leaves the fracture, and the patient lies down on the belly and on the face.</end_of_turn>
And then the minister extends all the ligament to its part according to its quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if it is close to the buttock, then let the ligament be firm at the fifth part, so that the extension will be in its place, and the other ligament leaves the fracture.</end_of_turn
And in the same way if the fracture is close to the heel, then let the ligament be firm at the heel, and let the extension be to the lower parts.</end_of_turn
And then the doctor should bite the bone with both hands as much as he can until he reduces that which is according to the natural shape, and the bone is joined by a good connection; the hour that he covers with a compress and a bandage, if it does not happen to the limb afterwards.</end_of_turn Maybe if it happens to him afterwards, the hour you will leave that for five days until the swelling has gone down, and then return to your care.</end_of_turn
The bandage should be so tight: cover with a bandage over the fracture a hard bandage, and bend two or three times, and remove the excess; and then cover the wound until it reaches the ankle and the buttock.</end_of_turn
And put long thread firmly between the buttock and the limb near the heel, and pass the extremities of the thread from the lower part of the pus sobirana of the two parts, and then roll over the limb and the buttock as much as the bandage allows.</end_of_turn
And then rest on the buttock in the place of that fracture and rest a star on the bone of the limb.</end_of_turn>
And then fill the gaps between the limb and the thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is solidified.</end_of_turn
And then start to tighten the bandage firmly from the middle over the place of the fracture with three or four covers, and when you have advanced to the ligament of the place of the fracture, your bandage should be less tight and lighter and softer.</end_of_turn
And then stretch two ends of the thread to the lower parts until it reaches the ankle, and tighten both ends of the star at the other side so that the ligament is not pulled from the place.</end_of_turn
And then leave the bandage on for a while, so that no swelling occurs to the limb or heel swelling or pain; and if any of these should happen, then immediately take it off and correct what has happened as soon as possible, as we have said above.</end_of_turn
Maybe if the bone is bad of the bone that we put in, the hour that we bite it off is possible; and if not, go away from it and leave it, and take care of what precedes the memory until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Each bandage is to be strengthened in this fracture of the thigh as well as in the bones, as we have said in the instructions and in the arms.</end_of_turn
Maybe indeed in the restoration of it in this way does not happen to the patient the fainting; and if it is restored alone, or if another one is applied to it, the hour that it is necessary that he close that from which he is fainting.</end_of_turn
And you must know that the thigh is strengthened in seventy days or a little more or a little less, and all this according to the diversity of complexities and of the other things.</end_of_turn

Treatment for the fracture of the heel bone.</end_
You must know that the fracture of the heel bone is very painful, maybe because of the tension of the muscles.</end_of_turn
Maybe if it happens to her the fracture is only a fissure or crack in her parts, and that is with swelling or inflammation, and about that all is at rest with the feeling.</end_of_turn
The restoration is in this way that it is ligated again what is broken of the parts as we have said until it is united and joined as much as is possible for equilibrium and facilitation and fabrication.</end_of_turn
Then press the palm of your hand firmly and place it over the round stone, if you desire; and stretch your thumb away from your stricture to the extent that is convenient.
Consider all the precautions that have been recommended in other fractures, thus as well as applying cautery and resembling those that are opposed to any mishap that may occur until health is restored
Chapter XVI.</start_of_turn>
Of the restoration of the fracture of the limb.</start_of_turn
Know that in the limb there are two bones, of which one is thick, and is called the limb; and the other is thin, and is called the bone.</start_of_turn
And as for any kind of fracture concerning which it is asked that restoration should be made, as in fractures of the forearm, and for that reason restoration of the forearm is equal to that of the limb, and the operation is one.</start_of_turn
And if two bones are fractured together, the limb is converted to all parts.</start_of_turn
And if the thin bone is fractured, the limb is converted to the parts surrounding.</start_of_turn
And if the thick bone is fractured, behold that limb, for from these things you will not be ignorant.</start_of_turn
And then administer extension, equalization, and ligation of the fragments according to the healing.</start_of_turn
Moreover, if the fracture of the limb is slight having no great displacement, that the extension be milder and lighter, and relieve by your skill.</start_of_turn
And in the limb is any cause for operation on the forearm, and that is when you have healed the edges and that you have completed your operation, then you will take hold of the ends of the fracture that are paused due to the causes that are paused alone, and it will be enough to remove the stiffness of the palm of the hand; align these with those that are small in greatness, and do not touch the edges, and let the length of these be according to the length of the limb and the degree of bending inwards.</start_of_turn
And then cover over any wound in two coverings according to their length, and place one over the part of the limb from one side and the other from the other side, and they should reach from the degree of bending inwards to the bottom of the foot.</start_of_turn
And then tie the two edges together in three places at the two extremities and in the middle, so that this structure of the limb is prohibited from leaning to the right and left, and that it remains in a good position.</start_of_turn
And now an armrest of paste is administered according to the length of the limb; and let the limb be fixed in it so that it conserves whatever movement.</start_of_turn
Moreover, keep covered more than enough what is in the fracture, and when it is like this you will do it properly.</start_of_turn
And finally consider every day the limb and study it in order to understand it better, and you will keep it from apostemas and from inflammation or from other causes resembling these; and when any cause of these occurs, then you will remove it from it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn
Of the fracture of the ankle and of the bones of the foot and of the toes.</start_of_turn
The ankle does not usually fracture; however, the bones of the foot do fracture sometimes; and as for the toes of the foot, they rarely fracture, and it does not happen to them except in cases of great force.</start_of_turn
And if the bones of the foot must fracture and sometimes those bones must be elevated between them, then you must place their heel on the prepared earth like when going.</start_of_turn
And then place the heel over what is elevated of those bones, and then plaster those, and press, and heal those until around them.</start_of_turn
And then press the plaster and stop displacement, and place under the heel of the foot a small board to which are attached two caps of plaster.</start_of_turn
And then stretch that which is under the heel to a descending stretch, since you have covered that with bandages and other causes that you do not indicate.</start_of_turn
And when three or four days have passed, then you will remove the ligament, because you will find the bones healed, or fractured or dislocated, and the operation in these is like that of the physicians.</start_of_turn
May be if anyone says they are truncated, then restore those, and soak those thus as well as I do and recommend to you in the restoration of these things of the hand. Then pause the truncated finger steady according to the length of the finger, and make a little space around it; and leave the thumb as I have recommended, and strengthen that which is below the stricture downward.</end_of_turn>
May be if these that are truncated of the bones are two or three or more, then pause over each finger the amount of its wrapped soft tissue, and strengthen the thumb at the base of the foot, and be standing on one of the heads of the thumb to keep the foot well retained.</end_of_turn>
And it is convenient for you to know that you must not omit any of the causes which we have mentioned to you in other fractures of accidents that we have mentioned; and take heed of every accident like this which covers.</end_of_turn
Chapter XVIII.</end_of_turn>
Of fracture of the bone of the thigh and of the fibula bone and of the heel bone.</end_of_turn
When the bone of the thigh is truncated, then cease that which is falling downwards, and incline that towards the side of two a little, and keep it stretched from behind.</end_of_turn
And put the mattress full under the thigh bone, and make points in the thigh bone thus as well as you hope; and keep the foot well-circulated, and elevate the two little ones little by little, until all that is outside is contained until the truncated bone returns to its place.</end_of_turn
And pause powders over the two little ones, and when you are going to urinate lean the thigh bone easily and gently, and reduce and return that as it is customary for this, and then return the powder first.</end_of_turn
And do thus for seven days or so, until that which is restored.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, take once of vinegar and strengthen over the wound of them a tube of sponge; and pour all the vinegar into the thigh bone, and keep blowing in the tube until the vinegar is inflamed within that the fracture returns.</end_of_turn
And keep full of cushion and stay until the patient has recovered as we have recommended, until he is healed.</end_of_turn>
And when the fibula bone of the foot or of the thigh is truncated, then administer in the restoration and agility of them what we have recommended for the bone of the ankle.</end_of_turn
And what is broken is not hidden in these primary fractures and that little debt, mainly to whom each one studies and uses understands this my book well; for that fracture signifies to you in the greatest possibilities of recovery in the restoration and stiffness of them, and therefore understand well.</end_of_turn
But in the heel bone when it is truncated, take vinegar and put the heel bone in that; and pause over it the covering of silk, and be covered, and keep it bound for three days or so, and be healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XIX.</end_of_turn
Of the restoration of the fracture of the bones when it is almost healed.</end_of_turn
It is convenient in that in which the fracture has occurred almost healed, especially if the bone is great as for example the bone of the thigh or the bone of the hip, or similar to this, that you keep and strengthen that which is so much as to make it flexible if the conditions of inflammation allow or if the testifiers tell you so.</end_of_turn
And if the wound heals, then cover that you keep to the retention of them what you powder over them when it is torn, if for another reason it does not exist.</end_of_turn
And start to restore the fracture in that same day, and do not prolong that, if not another accident occurs.</end_of_turn
But if another accident occurs suddenly, then leave the restoration of them until the swelling has gone down, and do not approach it on the third day and the fourth of all, because you will cause other accidents.</end_of_turn
But if the broken bone is prominent over the socket, cover that you make a hole to reduce that and to equalize that with your hands more easily and with less extension.</end_of_turn
But if the extension is not to your preparation and the equilibrium of them with the thighs is greater, then you reduce that with your hands more easily like this; and that is the torment which is made of iron, the length of which is of seven words or eight and the width is according to the quantity of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the doctor to be aware of these three or four according to the quantity that you indicate for the care of all kinds of fracture.</end_of_turn
The patient should be made as comfortable as possible without causing excessive pressure on the area being treated during the operation.
The pain is sudden and severe at the extremities, and the patient's skin should be relaxed and kept taut around the area affected
This is the way to do it:
It is called “labra volentz atelarem” in Greek, so it is very rare indeed
So that the acute elevation of the limb is covered over the prominence of the bone
And put it into a groove until the bone returns, and keep it equal with any bandage.
Therefore strive to make the limb of the fracture equal between them, and if the fractured limb is slight, do not take that for a sign of good acceptance, for the hour you must insert the limb of that bone until the instrument has power over what.
May it be that we cannot reduce the bone completely as we have recommended, however, we must take away that which covers the incision from the physicians which we have said; or saw that with one of the saws in whatever manner you can
And remove that which remains in the bone of asperities and small sores.
When the bone is reduced, and the patient finds great pain, then know that the bone has not been returned to its natural place; and therefore do what you can to comfort the patient greatly
When the restoration of the limb is finished, which you have made to the bone, and when the limb is immersed in black vinegar, properly if it is summer, and do not put pressure on the wound or any other cause where there is oil, for fear that it should cause swelling and corruption
And immediately after the restoration of the limb, administer sponges at the time of the meal to complement the restoration of the limb, and leave the wound uncovered except that you insert a drain with forceps and use bandages according to the quantity of the wound
Take great care that you do not tear the wound at the fracture, for that would be harmful to the physicians, and would cause great suffering to the patient, or that there should be inflammation or decay or softening of the tissues, for that would be healing improperly.</start_of_turn> And if the stricture of the limb should be loose, soft, different from the stricture of other fractures.</start_of_turn>
And if the wound is large or is a bad wound, and you fear that there may be other accidents on these limbs which we have recommended, and if there is pain in the area, then do not cover that area with sponges, but rather with a bandage of cloth in place of sponges and strengthen it with that.</start_of_turn
And when a day or two has passed since the wound has begun to heal, that there should be swelling in it, then you should remove the dressing which you had placed over that with vinegar, and immediately administer calamine, which we know to be useful for healing wounds, as well as other ointments that are commonly used for wounds of this nature.</start_of_turn
Advise the patient to rest and consider the wound every morning and evening until it is consolidated and stopped, and that the limb be prepared in such a way that the swelling should be easily eliminated from the body.</start_of_turn
If several days pass by and the wound is not consolidated or is not separated from the limb, then know that here we are dealing with setbacks of the small ones in order to cover up the wound.</start_of_turn And those setbacks which are separated remain and are extracted, those which are not separated adhere to the limb and cause pain, perforate me to order to insert them as it is possible.</start_of_turn
And if there should be black spots or swelling in the wound, this is a sign of gangrene or other kind of corruption and decomposition, and in that case you must immediately suspend any treatment that has been previously recommended for that.</start_of_turn
And when you see that the limb is bruised, take note of the limb just as well as the limb of the patient and the attendants, and that you do not presume that there is attraction of the limb, or the extraction of it which may result from the negligence of the physicians; leave that within the body until it is ready to fall out naturally, which will be in approximately xx days or .xxx; And treat the wound if you see it, and if not, leave it alone.</start_of_turn

Motas veguadas occur in this nodule in the remnant of healing from a fracture, especially when it is near the joints, and is usually caused by it. And it often hinders the natural movement of the limb
Therefore, consider if the nodule is new and administer in such medicines that have stopped this excessive bleeding, and see, and heart-beat, and swellings, and inflammation, and keep an eye on them; if you take some of these or all of them, and confirm that these stop bleeding, or are like glue, or are like vinegar, and rest them over the nodule to stop it, and tighten them around it for good support
And read the evacuation that you do not remove that for days; and if necessary remove that and do it again, until the nodule is gone; or stretch over that layer of lead downwards, for lead has the property of healing everything that is swollen in the limbs.
May be if the nodule is already hardened and stretched, and it is necessary to make an incision for the most important part of it, and cut that for the most solid part of it, and remove the tumor and the swelling, or break that which is like a clot within that until it is gone; and care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

From the restoration of a fracture when it is restored and then the limb is kept stiff and flexible not according to its natural movement.
When a fracture of a bone is restored, and then the limb is kept stiff, the following are not useful except for certain causes: that the ligament and the tendon of the limb have become too taut; or that there is excessive stiffness of the ligaments so that the nutrition of the limb is prohibited from running through; or for excessive swelling; or for an abnormal movement that is not in its time; or for a deficiency of healing in the body of the patient and for weakness of the limb.
And the care of this is to give food to the patient and make them drink while the healing is multiplied in them; give baths; and give ointment and let them know about it.
And keep the foot still on the limb, so that the foot does not impede the limb from receiving nutrition, or continue to embrocate it with cold water until the nutrition returns to its natural position
Capital .xxii
From the care of fractured bones when they are restored tortuously and prevent their operation from them so that they do not cover them
When an accident occurs to the limb that has already healed, with respect to the restoration of the fracture, there is suspicion of the fractured bone and the nodule, and it is for this reason that fear is shown towards the limb, however, the limb is not prohibited from its natural operation, since the limb does not cover what is said of that limb being new fractured
However, many fools of doctors and restorers have made this mistake which has caused great fear to the signal of which is mortal
However, if the fracture and the nodule are new, it is necessary to bathe them with cold water in which there are many softening herbs such as chamomile, gentian root, meadowsweet, and bittersweet thistle; and that it be applied with plaster along with other plaster of Paris or with gypsum or olive oil, and be plastered over; or that it be given the treatment of gentian root and be bound with flaxseed or hempseed, and be similar to the medicines that are not foreign to consolidation
And every day it is dissolved with prolonged rubbing that is gentle, and it is administered movement of the limb throughout the day in all hours.
However, if the curvature has already gone down again and has become strong and hardened, it is necessary to take care of it with iron, for the cover that is left over of the fracture must be dissolved, and it is indicated that the surplus of nodule from that middle be extracted from the bone that is underlying subtly, and that this be administered with ease in that which is requested and studied

Of discourse of dislocation.
Dislocation is the sudden displacement of any joint of the limb, because it is prohibited from movement, and is announced by the figure of the limb, and brings about the disease of pain and great lesions
Therefore, when an accident occurs in some dislocation, it is necessary to do everything possible to reduce it, and do not delay in doing so, for if it is delayed, the limb is swollen and strong, and it is difficult to reduce the dislocation.
E per aysso no cove que sia maugut ni stendut en la hora de la apostemacio, quar motas veguadas fa venir spasme e dolors ledentz.
When this happens, the doctor must cover the patient with a blanket of warmth, and immediately lay them inside until the afterbirth is complete; then moisten the limbs with warm water and oil, and reduce them with ease.
And all parts must be treated with the water from which the memory will remain in their place
And I have already ordered the heads of dislocation according to what is said before concerning fracture; from the upper part of the body to the lower part
Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Of the treatment of dislocation of the jawbone below.</start_of_turn>
So dislocated are both mandibles if they are not held in place; and the dislocation of both is caused in two ways: that they are slightly displaced from their places due to little movement, or that they are completely dislocated and completed, until they are softened in the part of the joint until saliva comes out from the patient's mouth and that they do not want to be able to open their mouths, and that their tongues are wrapped in their words.</start_of_turn
When the dislocation is slight, the doctor should return it to its place by itself without causing further injury.</start_of_turn
When the dislocation is complete and complicated, the doctor must immediately administer reduction of it diligently, and must not delay.</start_of_turn
And the minister must hold the patient's head, and the doctor puts their thumb of their right hand on the root of the dislocation of the jaw below the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that they put their two thumbs together inside, if the dislocation is on two sides, and that the other hands tell the patient to relax their jaws and loosen those that are clenched; and the doctor should gently grasp the jaw and bandage it until it returns to its place.</start_of_turn
And if the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are simultaneously dislocated, the doctor must administer evaporation with warm water and oil, until it is helpful to lighten the reduction of both and not to delay the reduction of both for too long, as we have said.</start_of_turn
And when they have returned and are softened, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, the doctor should stop over those little hairs of wax around the area, and apply wax and oil with a soft sponge.
And let the patient sleep on their two sides, with their head resting between two cushions, so that neither side is painful; and do not force them to swallow excessively; keep the patient's tongue moist with a sponge, until when the pains are subsided and the jaws are relaxed, the doctor can make them vomit.</start_of_turn
And when it is administered with ease, and not disturbing the eating, drinking and talking of the patient, until the jaw is healed and restored.</start_of_turn
And if it is difficult to reduce two jaws when they are dislocated at any time and do not recover their original positions, the doctor must administer cold baths and vinegar, and is highly recommended to make the patient vomit, and is highly recommended to give the patient vinegar water.</start_of_turn
When this happens often, the doctor must know that it is in vain; and that the one from whom this happened will die in a few days.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXV.</start_of_turn
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.</start_of_turn
The collarbone is not displaced from its lateral side due to its continuity with the feet; and some say that it is displaced towards the outside, and this is declared by the feeling.</start_of_turn
And the restoration of it is that the patient sits on their two feet and extends their arms.</start_of_turn And gently compress the area with your palm with great compression, so that it returns.</start_of_turn
And pause over that plaster and powder and tighten that.</start_of_turn
More often, the extremity that was previously held by the collarbone continues to be supported by it; it is not dislocated on any day; the doctor must reduce it and bandage it as we have said and as it is convenient for you.</start_of_turn
Then rest upon that swelling, sprinkle it with powder, extract it, and command the patient to remain calm and still until they are healed.
And in this same treatment, if the limb is separated from the hip bone, reduce the extremity of the muscle.</end_of_turn>
(The text provided ends abruptly without completing the sentence. The provided translation stops at the incomplete sentence.)</end_of_turn>
Regarding the reduction of dislocation of the muscle.</end_of_turn>
You know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which is one that it is dislocated from the part of the titillus to the part beyond.</end_of_turn
And the second is that it is dislocated from the part below the muscle, and that is urgent; it is not dislocated to the parts behind by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the parts in front by the nerves.</end_of_turn
And most of all it is dislocated outwards beyond the titillus, especially in those in whom the flesh is little, it is readily dislocated; more so in those in whom there are many bones, it is ejected outwards with difficulty.</end_of_turn
And it is much more common for such accidents to occur to men by percussion or falling, and the muscle of them is loosened from its aponeurosis, and is cured as soon as it has already been dislocated.</end_of_turn
Therefore when you are certain that it has been dislocated, then proceed with the treatment.</end_of_turn
And it is known that the dislocation of the muscle is when it is beyond the titillus; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy one, that you find among these different appearances; and you find at the head of the muscle a concavity towards the titillus as if there were a drop of blood, and to the patient it is not possible to reduce the hand to the hip without pain, or to make that movement at all.</end_of_turn
If it is dislocated from the heel or the ankle, and you find it to be so by touch, do not be fooled.</end_of_turn
And for this dislocation it is useful to reduce it as soon as possible when the patient is young.</end_of_turn
And the reduction is that the minister raises the hand to the part below; and immediately place the toes under the titillus of the limb, and raise the joint with force at its hip, and the minister raises the hand and extends that as well; and immediately pause that so that it returns readily.</end_of_turn
More so, if even though it does not return, since the accident occurred, for several days, cover that the patient should be bathed in lukewarm water and be administered embrocation that softens and relaxes like if there were many grains of wheat, fennel, and chamomile in the water, and be administered.</end_of_turn
And immediately the patient should be placed supine on the thighs and be kept still from the titillus of the limb until the swelling subsides between elevation and traction, and the other minister holds the head of the patient, that it is not bruised to the parts below, and another minister has the head of the patient, that it is not bruised to the parts below, because both these things must return to the hip.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, reduce it in this manner: that you find a man who is longer than the patient and who is on that side, and enter the thigh muscle beyond the titillus of the patient and elevate the titillus to the parts below until the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister pulls the hand of the patient from the parts below the belly.</end_of_turn More so, if the patient is feverish, cover him so that no other cause is suspended, so that it is known that the dislocation has returned.</end_of_turn
And it is reduced quite simply in another manner: and that is that it is placed on the ground a staff as long as the head of the patient, which is rounded like a mortar pestle, which is neither thick nor thin, and immediately put the hand of the patient at rest; because so it is supported by the head of the staff, the patient is placed according to the length of the staff, and the hand is extended to the parts below of the other side; and the body is extended from the other side with force, so that the joint returns to the hip with speed.</end_of_turn
And if the reduction is difficult for all the causes that we have said, then use this treatment: take a staff the length of two cubits, and the width of four fingers, and the thickness of it should be flattened on the surface of the tibia in this way:
And nearby on the round head they place lions' mane for so that it does not damage the patient.
And nearby they support the patient's genitals, and extend the hand or arm over the belly towards the thighs, and bind the belly over the assistants and the arms and the hand extremity.</end_of_turn>
And nearby support the arms on a stool as wide as necessary, and extend the hand towards the thighs, and the other limb is suspended from the other side, so that the joint is inside.</end_of_turn>
And when the intestines are complete according to any method that you consider, and when you have covered that you pause the genitals expect for a quantity of lanolin; and nearby put on a plaster of pounded pumice and album of alum on all the muscles, even if it is rotated downwards, and nearby tighten the genitals with stricture downwards; and the ligament is rotated over the plaster, and the hand is attached to the hip, and is laid flat, and do not touch the hand for seven days.</end_of_turn>
And cover that the patient does not eat much, until the limb is comforted, for it is more likely to recover quickly.</end_of_turn>
And nearby the food is given more than seven or eight times or is practiced a movement; and therefore if it is stopped and is not softened, the hour is already healed.</end_of_turn
More importantly if the joint is displaced slightly by moisture that happens to it or for another cause, the hour covers that a cautery is administered with three incisions, as it is said in the chapter of cautery.</end_of_turn
And if all this is done and seven days have passed, the ligament is loosened and the joint is not stopped, and the plaster and the stricture are reduced over it somewhat softened, and it is not stopped and is cathed and cannot raise the limb above its thighs, the hour knows that the nerves of it, which are at the head of the muscle, are either insensitive or extended or softened, and knows that the joint will never be fixed in place again.</end_of_turn
From the dislocation of that which is useful for you must take the foot and the heel or the buttocks, the reduction is useful with impulse and extension with the greatest, until it returns.</end_of_turn>
And it is administered in another stricture, and care that it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if it happens nearby the healing of the gravity in the limb and the delay in the movement of it, the hour recommends using a wet dressing until that gravity is alleviated and returns to its natural state.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXVII.</end_of_turn>
On the care of dislocation of the ankle.</end_of_turn
You know that the ankle joint is dislocated with difficulty and seems to return with difficulty; and that which is dislocated throughout is most of all at the front to the back, and the dislocation of it is not hidden from you that it is caused either from leaving it relaxed or from touching it according to whatever figure is dislocated, and when you adjust the ankle dislocation from the socket, which is to say that you make the dislocation manifest, that the joint is concave and cannot bend the limb, nor touch any of the muscles.</end_of_turn
And cover the ankle, and reduce the dislocation as much as possible until it returns to its place naturally, for if you see it naturally in the cautery, it is difficult for the reduction to take place, and it is not completely healed of all; and most of all when it is at the back, for it is worse of all other species of dislocation, and of greater pain, and many veins must be ligated at that time.
The restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the hand is extended with two hands, and the arms are expanded, and the master's hands are over the ankle and hold it, and the plaster is put on the joint with the nails of the master together, or with the heel of the palm within that it returns to its place.</end_of_turn
More importantly if the dislocation is at the front, the hour returns just as it bends the hand with its hand, until it pierces the ankle at the heel of the palm.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, the hour administers violent extension and force.</end_of_turn
And that two assistants extend the arms, and hold that support two assistants so that it is not left behind due to the extension.</end_of_turn
And nearby rotate the arms throughout, because it is enveloped with a fold of skin long over the hand, or ligament.</end_of_turn
When the doctor touches the joint with his hand, he should apply some oil to it so that those things which cause lubrication of the joint are facilitated; and then he should gently push the joint inwards until it returns.
Then he should reduce the swelling by covering it with a paste which is stiff and viscous due to the addition of alum, and which should be extracted with great care, and the arm should be suspended from the shoulder and allowed to rest for a few days.
And so if the joint is formed in the heel, then you should dissect the ligament of the heel and leave it like that.</start_of_turn>
And if the joint is not to be straightened, then you should repeat the packing and the ligament, and leave it like that for a few days until it is extracted; and then dissect that.</start_of_turn>
More if by chance the gravity should happen close to the reduction of the joint, and the situation is in movement, then administer oil in bath and subtle friction, and understand, until it is relieved; or rest over the joint relieved, so that there is no fatty movement; and then tie it up and leave it like that during the day and night.</start_of_turn And so on, put that in the bath; and when it has swollen, then gently massage the joint with temperate friction, and then repeat that once, twice, and three times.</start_of_turn Corruption has already reached the innermost parts of the body, within which it is limited.</end_of_turn>
And if you wish, rest over that wound of the moist cow and scald it around the border and above that; and do a few times, because that which is moist reduces to its situation.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of dislocation of the limb, that is between the arm and the hand.</start_of_turn
The limb of the hand many times is dislocated, and the reduction of the dislocation of it is light, which is different from the rest of the joints, however it must be speed in the reduction of it in the hour in which it is dislocated, since the limb is inflamed or that it happens in it inflamed caut.</start_of_turn
And the reduction of the dislocation of it is that you place the thumb of the patient on a table and extend the hand of that, and the doctor places his hand or palm over the imminent of the joint, and gently pushes that until it returns to its place.</start_of_turn
However it must be considered if the palm already rests on the belly of the hand, then the patient should place two of his hands on a table beside the extension and the reduction; and if the dislocation is previous you should place two of his hands, then the position of the hand of that intrinsically on the table, so that the hand of the doctor rests on that imminent of the joint.</start_of_turn
And so if it returns whole, it is good; and if not, then gently stretch that with the paste giving up the swelling and leaving that; do not repeat that until pain or swelling comes over the reduction of it more than days pass.</start_of_turn
However the joint remains according to its stiffness; and do not note to the patient any cause, but that the hand is softened and cannot stretch any cause; the hour is that the nerves are torn or broken, and that it is not caused by it but is stretched with a pointed cautery as in the case of it and is confirmed by what is conferred by any cause.</start_of_turn
Therefore when the limb is returned, then the doctor should pause over it the paste which has been recommended, and leave it and stretch it for five days; and then it should be dissected and left and the hand be exercised.</start_of_turn
However if its movement is late and it happens to it any gravity, then the doctor should lengthen that with cold water and with some friction a few times, until it is relieved.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXIX.</start_of_turn
Of the care of dislocation of the fingers.</start_of_turn
Some times the fingers are dislocated throughout.</start_of_turn
And when one of those fingers is dislocated at two of the palm or at the belly of it, then the doctor should stretch the finger and push out the dislocation with his thumbs until it returns.</start_of_turn
And then support the head of the finger, suspend that beyond the part from which it is dislocated, and leave that for two days.</start_of_turn
And immediately suspend that limb and extend the other until it is equal in that limb on that day.
When night falls, keep the other limb as before according to the story, and do not stop loosening that one in the day and exercising with movement, and keep that one in the night; and do this for several days until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And do the same with that which is dislocated at the wrist, and keep that limb at that part and do the first operation there, until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And do the same with that which is dislocated in other parts.</end_of_turn>

Concerning the treatment of dislocations of the bones of the two knees.</end_of_turn
When an accident occurs to any of the bones of the two knees or the ankle dislocation is complete, and so much mobility of the bones is lost in those places that treatment is not useful, for death is concealed by the illness.</end_of_turn
And a sign of this is that the evacuation of the illness is outside the will, and cannot be retained; and moist people make it softer to some parts of their body or two veins of their body, or two ribs of their body, or one of those; or if one of those bones is remauged, which is not remauged, and moist people make it softer to remove those four parts.</end_of_turn
Therefore that which is already remauged to the back is called swelling.</end_of_turn
May the treatment of them be that you consider if the swelling comes from pus, for in that case neither treatment nor healing will be of any use.</end_of_turn
May I tell you what the Ancients said about the methods of treatment which are long, of which the greatest part returns with profit; but I have already abridged that which is less useful of the many, for my proximity to your understanding exposes me to that which I have explained and exposed from various instruments which I will show you and explain that one.</end_of_turn
And of those only that which arises in the two knees properly in that which I recommend it.</end_of_turn
And that the illness be extended over its face over the edge of the bed, and be extended so that it does not touch the feet of the body.</end_of_turn
And immediately suspend that limb and extend the other until it is equal in that limb on that day.</end_of_turn
And the minister has the limb, and do not hold it in the fossa; and another minister has the other according to that form.</end_of_turn
And immediately cover over the head of the illness and leave only the toes uncovered; and extend the limb of the limb at the limb which is beside the head of the limb, and keep that one in it; and immediately strengthen the other ligament over the ankles of the limb and support the limb; and adjust all the ligaments and keep those in the other limb.</end_of_turn
And immediately the minister grasp the limb and extend the ligament to the part of the limb, and do not leave the two limbs and the ligaments of the limbs in which they are fixed, but indeed do not stop them as we have said.</end_of_turn
And the doctor puts his palms on the bone with strength until it returns, or that he puts them on a table, and immediately that he adjusts over the table the feet of the patient until it returns.</end_of_turn
But if it does not return in this way, the doctor takes a table of which the width or length is in the air of three ribs, and cuts in the wall from which we have said that it is proper for the illness to be in a place where the limb of the table is between the limb of the table.</end_of_turn And immediately stop the major part of the table on the bone, and the doctor puts the feet of the patient on the other limb, and opens up until the bone is fractured and returns to its place.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, or turn around which is revolved with the hand; and that you stay on the ground with the head of the illness at the back of the limb two limbs, the length of which is of an arm, and put the head of the limb at the back of the limb outside two limbs; and that the length which is between each limb be a palm, and that already be made in each limb fractured in which it returns, and that no limb be fixed on the ground so that it is not crushed.</end_of_turn
And let a round flask be placed over the turn, and let it be rotated in the two grooves of the two flasks.
And at the end of them is a groove in which the flask is formed, its length being equal to one palm from which it is rotated; and in the two other flasks it is similar to that.</end_of_turn>
And then tighten the ligaments that you have stretched on the patient's feet in the area where the head of the foot is, and the ligaments that you have stretched in the thighs of the patient in the area where the feet are.)</end_of_turn>
And then place every turn and let a minister hold the turn with his hand, and the doctor will grasp the spin according to what we have said.)</end_of_turn
When the spin has been returned, and the limb has been grasped, then cover that you have placed outside with a sponge of alum, and then stop; and place your hand over the outside of the sponge so that the intestine does not come out.
And so bind with the ligament which we have said, and use the patient of nourishing food until he is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if there remains any swelling in the limb at the end of the healing, then cover that you should administer medicines that soften and soothe with the administration of alum, which we have recommended; and it is administered in that limb when there is a wound of lead.</end_of_turn>
Every wound of imminent swelling at the rear of the spines of both is cured by that dislocation; and that is the bone which has already been mentioned because it does not cause any harmful consequence to it with this medicine, for its force will do you no good but to make you die.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XXVI.</end_of_turn>
Of the treatment of a dislocated ankle.</end_of_turn>
Know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the muscle do not suffer only dislocation, but that it does not happen to them except for dislocation alone, and not to the other joints of the little toe which have recession and concavity.</end_of_turn
And the ankle joint is dislocated in four ways, which is dislocated at the front, or at the back, or at the side, or at the heel.</end_of_turn
And mostly it is dislocated at the front, and little at the side or at the heel.</end_of_turn
The sign of the dislocation at the front is that when you adjust the limb of the healthy patient with the limb of the patient, the thumb is longer and more prominent than the healthy one, the limb cannot bend the knee over the ankle, and the limb is bent over the heel as soon as it is placed on the cushion, so that the head of the bone has already passed over here.</end_of_turn
The sign of the dislocation at the back is that these are counter to this accident.</end_of_turn
The sign of the dislocation at the side is that the limb expands its heel according to custom, but however it does not bend the ankle where it hurts, and if you force it to go forward it cannot go over that which is painful; and the urine is retained and the swelling is postpartum, and you must walk the limb over the heel.</end_of_turn
The sign of the dislocation at the heel is that it does not expand the ankle, nor does it allow bending that ankle which bends the swelling, and the limb is shorter than the other, and the swelling is softened, and the head of the bone is over that place.</end_of_turn
More reduction of these species of dislocation is that you consider, when the dislocation is old and ancient, that it is already ancient since you have not given it that treatment; for in that treatment there is no efficacy at all; and therefore you must not consider that there is any harmful consequence from it.</end_of_turn
More in that one in which the dislocation is recent, and is one of the four species of dislocation, you must keep the limb still so that you can return the joint and extend it at the front and at the back, and rather at the right and left, for its force will return and will not require any other treatment.</end_of_turn
More, if it does not return in this manner, you must prepare strong ministers and extend the limb of the patient from the lower part, or from the thighs, or from the ligament which is bound over the limb under the ankle; and another minister extends the hand of the patient with his thumb which rests on the tips of the toes; and hold tightly with a minister the heel of the limb, and have another minister hold the limb.</end_of_turn
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And reduce the swelling or blister to its concavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the swelling from bursting.
And extend all of those downwards until the patient is elevated to the height of the ground and remains suspended.
And this kind of extension is common to all four of them.
And therefore if the dislocation returns to where we have said, it is good; but if not, it is necessary to perform all the means that we have mentioned for its proper care
In the reduction itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is at the ankles, cover that the patient is supine on the lateral side; and place your hand over the area between the head of the thigh and the area that is left to be supported; and extend the ligament from the part of the angulation to the higher part of the furcula.
And another minister should strongly support the knees of the patient, and firmly grasp the large area of the painful thigh and extend outwards for violent extension, so that that which has returned to its place.
And this kind of treatment is lighter care than the one with which this limb is reduced than the others
More if you excuse yourself and do not obey the order with this kind of treatment, then cover that both feet of the patient are held together with a strong ligament, that is to say, over the ankle and over both toes and both ankles
And the length of each part is equal to the quantity of four fingers, and the painful limb should be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers
And the patient should be suspended over the head of the foot, and that should be in the major part; and the length of the limb from the ground should be equal to the quantity of two thighs
And command a a strong young man to reduce the head of the thigh, and that should be suspended with the patient another young man, and the other young man should support the thigh with force pushing, so that the joint returns to its place with speed.
And in the reduction itself, when the dislocation is at the outward part, cover that the patient grasps over the heel as we have recommended in the treatise; and strengthen the ligament over the painful limb itself and over the feet of the patient
And two cushions should be placed, one under the foot and the other under the head; and two cushions adjusted to the middle of the limb that has been placed over which a damp cloth is covered, so that the patient is not dampened because the limb is between the patient’s thighs, for otherwise the extension towards the lower parts should not be violent.
And each minister should extend their part, and the doctor with their hand grasps the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is at the ankle, cover that the limb should be extended gently, as we have mentioned in the treatise about the limb; and the doctor should place the palm of their right hand over the painful ankle, and with the other hand should hold that which has been held back, and in that holding pause that which was extended towards the lower parts towards the toe.
And if the dislocation is at the back, cover that the patient should not be extended towards the lower parts, but should be elevated above the ground; having covered that it should be held firmly, just as we have said if the ankle joint is dislocated outwards, as we have said of its position concerning two fingers; and it is about its face and the ligaments should be extended, as we have said, without any haste.
And cover that a bandage should be administered on the area around the joint.
Therefore when the reduction is accomplished as we have said — and the sign of the reduction of the limb is not concealed from you, that is to say that you extend two fingers of the patient, and when you have once again bound and the patient extends their limb and expands that excuse, you know that the limb has returned as we have said — and you adjust two cushions and hold tightly and extend with a bandage so that the ankle is not bruised in any part; and keep the patient still for three days or four
And remove the ligament and the bandage, and compare one limb with the other.
The hour has come, if indeed those wasts in the garments have already settled down, that the dislocation has already ceased, and now let us leave the patient in peace.
And if there is any cause of discomfort, then return and plaster that [joint] again, and extract that according to your first structure, and leave that for three days.</end_of_turn>
Then loosen that [bandage], and make the patient walk slowly for a few days until comfort is restored.</end_of_turn>
[End of text]</end_of_turn>
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.</end_of_turn>
The ankle is dislocated in three ways: when it is displaced outwards, inwards, or downwards; but not upwards.</end_of_turn
And the sign of dislocation is that the patient applies pressure to the area with their hand; when the ankle is actually dislocated.</end_of_turn
And the restoration of all these positions is that you make the patient move their limb freely, except that you hold the limb firmly in place if necessary; bind two fingers to the face of the limb, and place the foot of the limb between the thighs; and further bind the ankle of the limb to the palms of your hands, and keep those bound over the ankle for strength, and another servant shall extend the foot until the ankle returns to its place.</end_of_turn
And the sign of recovery is when the limb adheres to the area without pain and without limping.</end_of_turn
And then plaster that [joint] and bind the limb to the area, and leave them bound together with a bandage for three days or four, and then remove them.</end_of_turn
And do not let the patient walk for several days until they are healed and comfortable.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if the dislocation has been reduced by you, the hour must administer strong extension to the ligaments which preceded the narration in the treatment of the thigh.</end_of_turn
End of Document.</end_of_turn
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.</end_of_turn
The ankle has several veins which are slightly dislocated for a small removal, and some veins are displaced according to custom, and the dislocation is caused either by the outwards or inwards parts.</end_of_turn
And the sign of dislocation is that sometimes the ankle swells from the part from which it is displaced.</end_of_turn
The treatment for displacement is gentle restoration, and that it is easily extended with the greatest ease and is quickly healed.</end_of_turn
But in the treatment of dislocation according to custom, you must make the patient move their limb freely, and hold that limb firmly in place with force from behind the two fingers of that which are in the middle of the limb.</end_of_turn
And put your right hand on the heel of the foot and your left hand on the front part of the foot in the place of the ankle.</end_of_turn
And pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and push with your left for two veins, and extend with your left; and hold the foot firmly with your right hand at the base of the bandage.</end_of_turn
And do that for two veins as we have counted.</end_of_turn
And hold the foot to the bandage for the third vein, and you are at the ankle.</end_of_turn
So if it returns in one vein or two according to this manner, and if sometimes the foot swells, that is good; but if not, the hour must repeat the operation until it returns.</end_of_turn>
Moreover, if the reduction is prohibited for you in this way, the hour must make the patient lie on their side on the ground, and elevate a little piece of soft material under the foot, and hold them between the patient’s thighs, and you have already bound around the limb with a bandage so that the patient does not injure themselves.</end_of_turn
And the other servant must hold the patient’s thighs, and another servant must extend the foot with their hands or with the ligaments that lie on the ankle of the foot; and extend whichever minister you like against the extension of the limb, and the piece of soft material should remain between the patient’s thighs to prevent the limb from being pulled outwards from its extension.</end_of_turn
The doctor grasps the dislocation at the hip joint, while another assistant holds the sound limb away from the painful area, so that the dislocation can be reduced with ease.
Therefore, when the dislocation has been reduced and you have declared its soundness, then cease the plaster and gently stretch that which was strongly bent, and unite the limb to the limb that was flexed.</end_of_turn>
And take care that you fear or guard the nerves that lie behind the heel, so that the ligament above that should not be tight and the other should be gentle.</end_of_turn>
Then rest for two days or three; and if the ligament is softened, remove it.</end_of_turn>
And on the fourth day or the fifth, remove it and forbid the patient from walking for forty days.</end_of_turn> May be it is necessary to go forward despite this space, but it is not in vain that the dislocation is not dissolved and corrupted, and take what does not receive care.</end_of_turn>
And if by chance the patient has a relapse of the gout, cover that you administer in the cessation of the disease whatever is before our narration, in other places of care and embrocation, until it has been rectified.</end_of_turn>

Take that which is dislocated and grasp it slightly without excessive tension; and what is not difficult, abstain from it.</end_of_turn
If the dislocation is in the heel bone of the two feet, then cover that the patient should sit down on the soft earth or on a table, and be as if he were going.</end_of_turn
And place your foot on the ground, and pause the limb over what you see of the joints, and prevent that limb from bending until it returns, and that you see that it is already healed and does not reappear in the vicinity.</end_of_turn
And place under the foot of the patient a board that covers the whole foot, to which are attached two heads, and strengthen that which is stretched downwards and closed for three days; and then remove that and make the patient walk for a month, until it is healed and the restoration is assured.</end_of_turn
Chapter .xxxv.</end_of_turn
On the varieties of dislocations that are caused by swelling or fracture or any other lesion.</end>
When any of these causes occur, and you are dealing with the treatment of that and the restoration of it, many things are seen that cause death.</end_of_turn
And for this reason we do not cover that you should presume about the treatment of that and its restoration, but rather that one who is skilled in the art, with long experience, merciful and compassionate, punctual, not arrogant or presumptuous; and that he should use in the beginning of medicines that do not cause relapse so only, and read the patient to the divine judgment, rather than to that to which you hope for health from the loss, from the alleviation of the disease, and in which there appears any hope.</end_of_turn And so strive so much to make the reduction in the beginning of the disease, preventing relapse at all costs.</end_of_turn
And so if the limb returns as we want, then administer a regimen that relieves the pain that accompanies the swelling and dries up the moisture.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation is in a fractured bone and the fragments are separated, then you must pierce the membrane of the bones, and do as we have said in the simple diseases of what is before said concerning them.</end_of_turn
And keep and avoid as you are able the harmful things that you are commanded by your fear according to my prediction; for what is better for you than to have recourse to your Creator, and may it remain to your glory, and may it be more profitable to you in the end.</end_of_turn> Thus ends the words of Albucasim perfectly praising God from whom no blessing is withheld.</end_of_turn Amen.</start_of_turn>
