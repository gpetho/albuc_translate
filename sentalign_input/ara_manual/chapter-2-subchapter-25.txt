Chapter Twenty-Five
On warts growing at the tip of the nose.
Often a wart grows at the tip of the nose, then enlarges and increases with time until its appearance becomes ugly.
Therefore, it should be cut off at its first appearance and completely excised. Then, either cauterization or a caustic medication that acts as cauterization should be applied to the area. If its excision is delayed until it grows large, examine it.  If it is hardened, solid, dark in color, and has little sensation.
Do not apply iron to it, for it is a cancerous tumor. I have often seen that when this tumor is cut, a great affliction returns upon its owner.  If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that complete excision is possible,
Then have the patient vomit and cut it without hesitation or delay. Treat the site with something that dries and constricts until it heals.
