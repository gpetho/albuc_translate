When the teeth appear not according to their natural position, and the form is unsightly, especially in young women, then you must know if the tooth is born after the other tooth, and is not in the right place, and it cannot be filed or smoothed: then scrape it; and if it is aligned with the tooth, take this instrument of which this is the form, and it resembles a small beak, and is made of sharp iron at the tip:
And cut it little by little over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is visible that it can be filed, then file it with such a file as this form shows:
and it is like the file used for making needles; and file the tooth little by little over several days lightly, so that it does not move until it falls; then smooth it at the end with some kind of scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, then you must file the roughness until it is even, so that it does not hurt the tongue or corrupt speech.
