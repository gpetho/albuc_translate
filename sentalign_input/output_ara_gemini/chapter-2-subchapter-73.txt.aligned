As for hemorrhoids, it is a swelling of the mouths of the veins until much blood flows from it constantly.	Haemorrhoids are an inflation of the heads of the blood-vessels leading to abundant and constant bleeding.	0.67932224
So when hemorrhoids become chronic, they become warts, and I have mentioned in the classification their types and signs, and we mention here what accepts treatment from them and what does not accept treatment.	When haemorrhoids are chronic they turn into warts. I have already mentioned in their place the kinds of wart and their symptoms. Now here I shall say which kinds permit of treatment and which do not.	0.86647224
So I say that if the hemorrhoids and warts are in the depth of the uterus and have not appeared to the senses, then there is no treatment for them with iron.	I begin by stating that haemorrhoids and warts in the depths of the uterus that are not palpable are not able to be treated operatively.	0.69842654
So it is necessary that the woman enter a cold room then stretch the warts with tweezers or with a rough cloth and cut them from their roots.	So you should get the woman into a cool place and then draw on the warts with forceps or catch hold with pieces of rough cloth, and cut them away from the roots.	0.84841734
Then sprinkle on it, when the blood flows, one of the styptics that stop the blood without cauterization, such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, and the like.

Then if the bleeding continues, make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts, and the like.	And if the haemorrhage persist for a long time make her sit in an infusion of sumac and pomegranate rind and oak-galls and the like.	0.8257201
Then take barley flour and knead it with honey and vinegar and apply a bandage with it on her back.	Then take barley flour and beat it up with honey and vinegar, and apply to the back a plaster made of this.	0.9320259
Then if the bleeding stops, and if not, then adhere to cupping the back and the breasts without scarification.	And if the bleeding cease, good; but if not, apply to the loins and breasts cupping-vessels without scarifying.	0.7607411
Then take wool and immerse it in purslane juice or plantain juice or blackberry branch juice with gallnut drink and apply it to the area.	Then take wool and dip it in the juice of red cynomorium or plantain or wild eglantine, together with syrup of oak galls, and apply to the place.	0.784783
Then when the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals.	And when the swelling has subsided treat the place with ointment until it heals.	0.8967183
As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of snakes, rough in appearance.	Now red pustules resemble the heads of thyme, and are of rough appearance.	0.7407974
So it is necessary to cut what appears of it according to what I mentioned about the warts exactly and treat it until it heals.	All that appears on the surface should be cut away in the manner mentioned for treating warts; and dress the wounds until healed.	0.6901966
