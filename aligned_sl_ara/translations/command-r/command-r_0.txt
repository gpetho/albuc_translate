When I had completed for you, my sons, this book which is a part of the science of medicine in its entirety and brought it to perfection with regard to clarity and intelligibility, I saw that I should complete it by adding this chapter, which is a part of manual practice.
For manual practice, although neglected in our country and time, is indeed its very perfection; so much so that the science behind it was almost extinct and its traces obliterated. Only a few drawings remain in the works of ancient scholars, corrupted by hands and distorted by errors and confusion to such an extent that their meaning became obscure and their benefit remote.
I decided to revive it, and so I composed this chapter in the form of an explanation, clarification, and abridgement, and I included illustrations of cautery instruments and other tools required for manual procedures, as these are essential aspects that enhance clarity.
The reason why there is no skilled practitioner in our time is that the art of medicine is a lengthy process and one who wishes to practice it should first study anatomy, as described by Galen. To understand the benefits, forms, temperaments, connections and disconnections of the organs; to know the bones, nerves, muscles - their number, exits and locations; and the pulsating and stationary veins.
Therefore, as Abuqarat said: 'Physicians by name are many, but in practice few; this is especially true regarding manual procedures.' We have mentioned some of these points earlier in the introduction to this book.
For anyone who is not knowledgeable about the anatomy we have described, will inevitably make mistakes that may lead to people's deaths - something I have witnessed often among those who claim expertise in this field without proper knowledge or understanding.
For I have seen an ignorant physician perform surgery on a cystic tumor in a woman's neck, inadvertently severing some of the blood vessels of the neck, causing the woman to bleed profusely until she died right before his eyes.
I have also witnessed another physician extract a gallstone from an elderly man, the stone being large in size; however, he acted hastily and extracted it along with a piece of the bladder wall. The man died after about three days, and I had been called to perform the extraction; upon examining the gallstone's size and the patient's condition, I correctly estimated that this would likely be the outcome.
I have also seen another physician, who earns their livelihood by practicing medicine under the patronage of certain powerful figures in our town.
There was a case of a young black boy with a broken leg near the heel and an accompanying wound; the physician, in their ignorance, quickly bound the fracture to the wound with tight bandages and splints, not allowing any room for the wound to breathe.
Then he released him to his own desires, leaving him for several days and instructing him not to loosen the bandages until his leg and foot had swollen significantly and he was on the brink of death.
I was called to his aid, and quickly unbound the dressings; he immediately found relief from his pain but the damage had already taken hold in that limb, and I could not restore him.
The corruption continued to spread throughout the affected limb until it ultimately led to his demise.
I have also seen another physician who operated on a cancerous tumor; after several days, it became inflamed and the patient's condition worsened significantly. This is because when a cancer is purely of black bile origin, it should never be treated with surgery.
Except if it is in a member that can bear to have all of it excised.
For this reason, my son, you should know that work done by hand is divided into two categories: an action that brings safety and an action which results in damage in most cases.
I have warned you in every part of this book about the actions that carry risk and danger, so you should avoid them and refuse to perform them.
So that the ignorant may not find a way to speak and make accusations, be cautious and vigilant for yourselves, and gentle and deliberate for your patients.
Use the better path that leads to safety and a commendable outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to heal.
Purify yourselves from anything that you fear might bring suspicion upon your religion and your life, for it will preserve your honour more and raise your status in this world and the hereafter.
As Galen said in some of his advice, 'Do not treat the sick with evil, lest you become physicians of evil.'
I have divided this article into three sections.
Section One
On cauterisation with fire and sharp medicinal agents, categorised and arranged from the head to the foot, including illustrations of instruments, cautery irons, and everything needed for work by hand.
Section Two
On incision, suction, bloodletting, cupping, surgical procedures, arrow extraction and the like, categorised and arranged, including illustrations of instruments.
The third chapter.
On reduction, dislocation, treating sprains, and other matters; arranged in an ordered manner from the head to the foot with illustrations of instruments.
The first chapter.
On cauterisation.
Before we describe the procedure, it is necessary to mention its benefits and drawbacks, as well as in which humoral constitution it should be employed.
Speaking about the benefits and drawbacks of cauterisation is a lengthy discussion, an intricate science and a hidden secret; several sages have addressed this matter.
They disagreed on it, and I have abbreviated their discussion for fear of being too lengthy.
In general, cauterisation is beneficial for all bad humoral constitutions that involve an excess of matter or none at all; except for two cases: a hot constitution without excess matter and a dry one without excess matter.
Regarding a dry constitution with excess matter, there is disagreement among scholars: some say that cauterisation is beneficial in this case, while others argue the opposite, stating that cauterisation should not be employed for ailments arising from heat and dryness, given that fire's nature is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to treat an ailment arising from hot and dry humours with a remedy that has a hot and dry nature. Those who argue against cauterisation state that burning with fire might be beneficial for ailments caused by heat and dryness in some people's bodies. Because when you add the body of a human being and its moisture to the nature of fire, you render the body cold.
And I agree with his statement because my experience has revealed that to me many times, but one should not conceive of this matter unless they have trained and practiced extensively in the realm of cauterization. He became aware of the diversity of people's temperaments, the state of diseases within their bodies, their causes and symptoms, as well as their duration.
As for the other temperaments, you need not fear them, especially in cases of cold and wet diseases, as all physicians agree upon it; they do not differ about the benefit of cauterization in such cases.
Know, my sons, that one of the secrets of healing lies in cauterization with fire, and its superiority over caustic medications, for fire is a singular essence whose action does not extend beyond the part cauterized, causing little or no harm to any other connected organ.
Whereas cauterization with caustic medications may extend its action to other organs, perhaps causing illness that is difficult to treat or even resulting in death; fire, due to its nobility and the nobility of its essence, rarely does such a thing unless it is excessive.
This has been made clear to us through experience, due to our lengthy service, attention to practice, and comprehension of the matter's underlying truths.
For this reason, I have dispensed with lengthy explanations; were it not inappropriate for a book such as mine, I would present to you a profound secret about fire, its operation on the body, and its ability to expel diseases through philosophical and demonstrative reasoning that is beyond your comprehension.
Know, my sons, that they have differed concerning the time that is suitable for cauterization and deemed springtime as the most favorable period.
I say that cauterization is appropriate at any time because the harm done by time is outweighed by the benefit gained through cauterization. Especially if cauterization is needed for severe, intense pain that cannot be delayed due to the fear of subsequent complications which may be more serious than any minor damage caused by time.
And do not consider in your minds, my sons, what the general public and uneducated physicians assume: that cauterization which cures a certain illness will never recur; this is an incorrect assumption.
This is not the case, as cauterization is akin to medication that alters the temperament and dries up the moistures which are the cause of pain.
However, cauterization is preferred over medication due to its rapid success, strong effectiveness, and powerful influence.
The illness may possibly recur at some point in time depending on the patient's temperament, the severity of their condition, and the accumulation of excesses in their body due to neglecting their diet and other such causes.
Unless the illness that requires cauterization is a mild one, occurring in an organ with few excesses and moistures. For example, cauterizing a tooth for pain, or something similar; the pain may not return, and this is more likely in minor cases.
As for the common people's saying that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, this statement is correct but not in the way they mean it; they believe that no treatment can be effective with medication or otherwise after cauterization, but this is not the case.
The meaning of the saying that cauterization is the last resort in medicine is this: when we have employed all methods of treatment for a disease and these treatments do not work, then as a final measure we apply cautery, which does work; hence arose the saying 'cauterization is the last resort in medicine.' No, it does not mean what the common people and many ignorant physicians think.
The ancients have stated that cauterization with gold is better than with iron, and they said this due to the moderation of gold and its noble nature; they also claimed that the site of cauterization does not become ulcerated. However, this is not absolutely true.
For I have tested this, and found that it only has this effect on some bodies but not others; cauterization with gold is better and more effective than iron as they said, except when you heat the golden cautery in fire, you cannot determine how hot it is due to its red color.
But it quickly becomes cold, and if you increase the heat it melts in the fire and sticks together, causing the practitioner to become occupied with this; thus cauterization with iron is faster and more convenient for practice, God willing.
I have arranged this section on cauterization into chapters, from the head to the foot, so that it is easy for the student to find what he requires, God willing.
Chapter One.
For the head, there is one type of cauterization.
This type of cauterization is beneficial for an excess of moisture and cold in the brain, which causes headaches, frequent nasal discharge towards the eyes and ears, excessive sleepiness, toothache, and sore throat. In summary, every disease arising from coldness such as paralysis, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and other similar diseases.
This cauterization is to be done after first commanding the patient to purge by taking a laxative medicine that purifies the head for three or four nights, according to what is warranted by the strength of the patient, their age, and their habits.
Then command him to shave his head with a razor, then have him sit in front of you cross-legged with his hands placed on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose, between his eyes. Wherever your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery iron which is depicted here:" [image caption]
Expose a piece of bone the size of a cumin seed or the size of a chickpea. Lift your hand, and if not, then reapply your hand with the same iron or another one if it has cooled. Until you see the piece of bone I mentioned to you, then take some salt and dissolve it in water. Soak a cotton pad with this solution and place it on the spot for three days.
Then apply a cotton pad soaked in butter and leave it on until the crackling of the fire ceases, then treat it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals, God willing.
They say that the longer the wound remains open, draining pus, the better and more beneficial it is.
Some have mentioned to cauterize the skin down to the bone and hold the iron until some of the bone's thickness burns, then remove what has burned from the bone afterwards and treat it.
Others said that cauterization should be excessive, to have a strong effect on the bone, so as to extract from it something like a carat or a small token. They claimed that this releases vapors from the head and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then it is treated until it heals. I do not see these two types of cauterization at all, except in some people and as a matter of chance. Omitting them seems better to me. If the skull becomes detached, then the head weakens whenever its natural connection is broken, just as we have observed in other body parts.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is safer and better, in my opinion, so I will use it. By doing this, one remains safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
On cauterization of the head also.
If there is a chronic pain in the head, and this persists for some time, especially if cauterization has been done to one spot as described above without any benefit from ear drops, collyrium, snuffs, ointments or dressings, then look into it. If the patient's head is naturally strong in structure, not weak, but they feel intense cold, cauterize another spot above that one a little bit. Then cauterize each horn of their head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the described amount of bone is exposed. Cauterize another spot at the back of their head, known as "the axe". Go easy on this one and do not expose any bone since the patient will feel severe pain here more than anywhere else in the head. I will mention this cauterization again when we get to it.
The iron used to cauterize the temples and occiput should be finer than that with which we cauterize the vertex of the head, and this is its picture.
Chapter 3.
Non-chronic migraine.
If in the side of the head there is pain with headache, and this pain extends to the eye, let the patient vomit up the drugs that clarify the brain, and use the other treatments I have mentioned elsewhere for diseases; if they do not work then cauterize it in two places. Either with the caustic drug or by means of an iron.
With regard to cauterization with the caustic drug, you should take a single clove of garlic and peel it and then cut off its ends from both sides; next, make an incision in the painful area on the temple using a broad lancet so that there is space under the skin large enough for the clove.
Push it under the skin until it is buried, then bind it firmly with bandages and leave them in place for fifteen hours; after that remove the bindings and take out the garlic and let the wound be left open for two or three days before dressing.
Apply a lint soaked in butterfat until the area becomes suppurative, then treat it with ointment and continue this treatment until it heals, God willing; if you wish to do so using some of the caustic drugs I have mentioned earlier in section eighteen about such drugs.
As for cauterization with an iron, it is performed thusly: heat the iron shown here:
And it is called the stud cautery because its head is like a nail with some rounding, and in its center there is a small protrusion.
Then you place it on the painful spot, holding your hand as you turn the rod little by little, and the amount burned should be equal to half its thickness. And you lift your hand so as not to burn the artery beneath, lest it bleed; then you soak a cotton pad in salt water and place it on the spot, leaving it for three days. Then you moisten the cotton pad with butter, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this headache with the knife-like tip of the iron, being careful to avoid cutting the artery in this non-chronic headache.
Chapter Four
On treatment of chronic headaches.
If you treat the headache with the methods mentioned earlier, or those described in the previous chapters on diseases, and it does not improve, then you see that the cause is something beyond what these initial cauterizations with medicine or fire can address... You should heat the knife-like iron until it whitens, then mark a line on the painful spot that is about half a finger in length or thereabouts; you leave your hand once and while pulling, cut through the artery down to the bone.
But you must be careful not to come into contact with the movable jaw during chewing, lest you burn either its muscle or nerve, causing a spasm.
Be cautious and vigilant to prevent the bleeding of the artery you have cut, for in doing so there is great risk. Especially for those who do not know what they are doing, and have no proven expertise; in such a case, it is better to refrain from action.
The management of accidental arterial bleeding will be discussed in detail later in the book, God willing; if you encounter a condition that is not suited to this cauterization technique.
If you believe the patient's condition can tolerate it, proceed with cauterization on the center of the head as described; treat the wound so that it may heal, God willing.
As an alternative, you may employ the cauterization method we discussed in the chapter on 'Milking the Artery with a Double-Knife Cautery'; it is a superior and more effective form of cauterization.
Chapter Five.
On cauterization for earaches.
If a chill causes an earache and treatment with laxatives and other methods we have mentioned in the relevant chapter does not provide relief, then heat your cautery tool known as 'the dot'; this is what it looks like:" [Insert image here]
Apply the heated cautery tool, 'the dot', around the entire affected ear in a circular motion; or around both ears if they are both painful. Keep the cauterization away from the base of the ear, marking your target spot with ink; apply ten dots or so of cautery to each affected ear, then treat the spots as necessary until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six.
Where is the power?
The power that is treated with cauterization is of the type that occurs due to phlegm, as mentioned in the chapters on diseases.
One should avoid cauterizing the type of condition that occurs due to nerve dryness and contraction.
When treating this type of power with earpicks, nasal inhalants, and gargles, if your treatment is not effective, the patient should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make sure to cauterize on the opposite side of the affected area because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization process involves cauterizing once just below the upper tip of the ear, under the head's horn slightly, and again on the temple, with a length equivalent to that of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cauterizer until it burns half the thickness of the skin. This is what a cauterizing iron looks like; it's a type of scalpel, as you can see, but slightly more delicate. The scalpel should be slightly thicker than usual, and then you treat the area as mentioned previously until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
On cauterization for chronic apoplexy.
If the stroke is severe and you treat it with what we have mentioned, but your treatment is not effective and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize them four times. On each side of the head, cauterize once. Then, one more in the middle of the head as mentioned earlier, and a final one at the back of the head as previously instructed.
The recipe for the cauterizing irons is as previously described. You may also cauterize once on the abdomen, which should be even more effective. Then, treat it with the method outlined above.
Chapter 8.
In treatment for forgetfulness.
For forgetfulness caused by phlegm, the patient should first be given large quantities of aegeratum and brain-purifying grains.
Then, the patient's entire head should be shaved and a mustard poultice, as described in the chapter on poultices, should be applied to the back of their neck. This can be done multiple times; it is a form of cauterization.
Perform this treatment in the same manner as described there. If the patient recovers, that is well and good; otherwise, cauterize them three times at the back of their head in a straight line from the top of the skull to the nape of the neck.
Ensure a gap of one finger's breadth between each cauterization. Then, treat the cauterized areas as outlined before. If you wish to increase the dosage and the patient can tolerate it further, then cauterize them once more in the middle.
If you wish to increase the dosage further, cauterize them on both sides of their head and treat it until they recover. The cauterizing iron should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter 9.
Stroke and relaxation of the entire body.
One should proceed to purify the head with iyarajat and what we have mentioned, then shave the patient's head, cauterize in the center of the head, at each corner of the head, and on the back of it.
And three times on the vertebrae of the neck; if you need more for a body relaxation condition, and the patient can endure it while having a strong illness, cauterize four times on their back's vertebrae. Be thorough with cauterization until you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand and treat it as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing; the iron should be olive-shaped.
Chapter 10.
On the cauterization of epilepsy.
Epileptics with phlegm-induced seizures should first purify their brain with major iyarajat and other treatments mentioned in the previous chapter if they are adults who can tolerate medication.
For children who cannot tolerate medication, use mouthwashes and chewables to purify their brain days beforehand with diet improvement.
Shave their head, then cauterize once in the center as previously described and another at the back of it. If the patient is strong and can endure it, cauterize as mentioned for stroke patients on neck vertebrae and back vertebrae; the iron should be olive-shaped like before.
If the patient is a child, make the cauterizing iron delicate and of this shape.
Chapter 11.
In cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is due to corrupted humours and thick phlegm, apply the cauterizations that we mentioned for the patient with hemiplegia.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess leaning towards black bile and the patient's body is moist, give them what purifies their brain as mentioned previously in the chapter on humours.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of linen like a circle and place it in the middle of their head while they are seated cross-legged holding each end. Then take one pound of old sheep butter.
Then heat it over a moderate fire to the point where the finger can tolerate its heat when inserted, then empty it into the circle on their head and leave it until it cools. Do this for the patient once a week along with the rest of their good treatment until they recover, God willing.
If you wish, cauterize them with small dots in great numbers without holding the iron in your hand but rather make it like a sniff; this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply to it cotton soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter 12.
On cauterizing the discharge from the eye.
If you recognize the initial onset of cataract in the eye through the signs mentioned before, then start treating the patient immediately and let him take medicines that clear his head and protect it from all moisture. Let him perspire in a bathhouse after fasting for some days.
Then let him shave his head and cauterize the center of his head, then perform two more cauterizations on each temple, if cataract has begun to affect both eyes or just one eye respectively.
After that, seal all the veins and arteries under the skin with the cauterizing iron; make sure to cover the entire temple area lengthwise and widthwise while being careful not to let blood escape.
If you notice any of this, then cut it off immediately using whatever treatment is available to you; we will discuss the wisdom behind sealing arteries and preventing blood loss in a later chapter.
One may cauterize the back of the neck, under the two bones, with intense heat.
Chapter 13.
On cauterizing chronic lacrimation.
If lacrimation is chronic and persistent, stemming from the veins and arteries on the exterior of the head outside the skull, and you are certain that this is due to superfluous cold, thick phlegm, then cauterize it exactly as described earlier in the chapter on cataract onset. Cauterize the center of the head, two times on each temple, and twice in the back of the neck underneath the two bones. If necessary, add one more cauterization on each side towards the tail end of the eyebrow near the edge. Use a small iron for this last step.
Chapter Fourteen.
In cauterizing the nose.
If you treat it as we mentioned in the section and treatment is not effective, then quickly send the sick person to a specialist; let him drink *coccagea* for three nights then shave his head and cauterize the middle sinew with an oily cauterizer. Then cauterize with the nailed cauterizer two cauterizations above the eyebrows, slightly under the hair, and be careful not to cut the artery; this is an image of the nailed cauterizer.
Chapter Fifteen.
In cauterizing the relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid with one cauterization using this crescent-shaped cauterizer.
You may cauterize slightly above the eyebrows with two cauterizations on each side, keeping away from the temples; each cauterization should be as long as the eyebrow.
Do not overdo cauterizing with your hand but only to the extent that a third of the skin burns, and this image shows what the cauterizer should look like.
Chapter Sixteen.
In cauterizing the eyelid.
If the eyelashes turn inwards, causing eye damage, there are two types of cauterization to treat this condition. One method is cauterization by fire, for which you should instruct the patient to stop plucking their eyelashes so that they grow long and even before starting treatment.
If you extract it when it is growing, then bind its eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until it grows back. When it has regrown and healed, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of a bay leaf.
The marking should start near the eyelashes, then place under the eyelid some cotton soaked in egg white or in the juice of the seed of althaea, then heat this iron tool as shown [in the picture].
Then cauterize according to the marked shape in small portions over many applications, until the entire surface of the skin shaped like a bay leaf is burnt, especially its visible part. The sign of proper work is seeing the eyelid retract and hair rise off the eyeball.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days, then apply some cotton with butter until the scab is removed, then treat it with an ointment until it heals, if God wills. If any hair regrows after a while and the eyelid sags again...
So repeat the cauterization on that spot as you did first, if hair regrows in the lower eyelid then burn it until it returns to its natural place and does not touch the eye again. As for cautery with a burning medicine, this is when you ask the patient to let their eyelashes grow long and even...
Then make a bay leaf shape from paper, then take one drachma (or equivalent) of each of common soap and unslaked lime, grind them all together well and do this quickly so it doesn't dry out... Then spread some of it on the paper you made like a bay leaf, and place it on one or both eyelids, putting under each eye cotton soaked in egg white as before, with the patient's head in your lap...
Place your index finger over the medicine and press it slightly as you move it, every time the patient feels a stinging sensation from the medicine because they feel like fire is stinging them; so long as there's that stinging feeling leave the medicine where it is and keep moving it with your finger; when the stinging stops remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Look, if you see the eyelid raised like it would be when exposed to fire or cut; unless do put medicine on the spot that wasn't affected and didn't turn black until your work is done and the eye heals; then place cotton with butter on it so as to remove any scabs from burns.
Then treat it with palm ointment or another until it heals; and you should be extremely careful when working to make sure no medicine falls into the eye; if the eyelid relaxes after days pass and there might be something in the eye.
Then put medicine on the spot that relaxed from the eyelid, specifically as you did first; then treat it until it heals; this is an image of a myrtle leaf.
Know that people's eyes may differ in size and bigness so based on this, adjust your treatment accordingly; the correct way is not hidden from those who are practiced in this craft.
Chapter 17.
On cauterizing the fistula that appears in the corner of the eye.
If you treat the fistula as mentioned in the disease sections and your treatment doesn't work, then cauterization should be done like this.
Instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, and have a servant hold their head between your hands firmly so that it does not move or shake.
Then, place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or the saliva of a berberis on their eyes and heat this iron.
It should be hollow, shaped like an eagle's feather tube from one end which will be used for cauterization. If you wish, the other end can be perforated and if you prefer, it could also be solid like a rod - although this hollow design is better for your procedure, God willing.
Then, squeeze the fistula if it is open and remove any pus, drying it off. If it isn't open already then you must open it to extract any pus before applying the very hot iron upon it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
Keep your hand away from the eye, moving slightly towards the nose when cauterizing to avoid any mistakes or agitation of the patient which could cause you to drop the iron onto the cornea and damage it. Should you reach the bone in the first cauterization then well done, but if not, return with the iron a second time should you need to.
Leave it for three days then apply a cotton pad with butter and treat it using a drying ointment until it heals. Should forty days pass without healing then employ an intense caustic medication to expose the bone, debriding as will be described later, God willing.
An alternative method of cauterizing a fistula, as described by some ancient authorities: Incise the fistula and place within this incision a thin funnel like so.
You pour into it the weight of a dirham of molten lead, and you hold your hand on the funnel with a good grip, tightly closed. The patient must not move at all so that the molten lead does not run into his eye; and you should place on the patient's eye some cotton wool soaked in egg white or water.
For the lead burns the spot of the fistula and heals it in a wonderful way; if the fistula is healed by what we have mentioned, namely cauterization and treatment, otherwise, there must be recourse to puncturing the nose and returning the fistula into the nasal passage as will come up in its specific place.
Chapter 18.
On cauterizing the split lip.
A split in the lip, called a fissure, often occurs, especially on boys' lips as it happens frequently; if you treat this fissure with what we have mentioned under its division and treatment and the therapy is not effective, then heat up a small spatula-shaped cauterizer of this kind.
Its inner cavity is as thin as a knife, then you place it hot with haste in the fissure itself until the cauterization reaches to its depth; then treat it with caustic alkali so that it heals God willing.
Chapter 19.
On cauterizing the fistula in the mouth.
If a swelling appears at the base of the gums, or on the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then suppurates and bursts, and from the discharge of pus a fistula forms; if you treat it but the therapy is not effective in its treatment, then you should heat up a cauterizer of an appropriate size for the fistula.
You enter it hot through the fistula hole and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depths and furthest point, doing this once or twice then treat it afterwards with what we mentioned earlier in treatment until it is healed if God wills it.
If the discharge stops and it is healed, but if not, then one must examine the place and remove the rotten bone according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In treatment of loose molars and relaxed gums.
If the gums relax due to moisture and the molars move, you treat them with medication but it doesn't work, place the patient's head in your lap then heat the iron which is pictured below after placing the pipe on the molar.
You insert the heated iron through it with the wheel and hold your hand for a short time until the patient feels the fire's heat has reached the molar's root then you lift your hand and reinsert the iron multiple times as needed, then the patient rinses their mouth with salt water.
They hold it for an hour then spit it out, the loose molar becomes fixed and relaxed gum tightens while rotten moisture dries up.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In treatment of toothache.
If toothache is due to cold or worms and medication doesn't work then cauterization has two methods, either with butter or fire.
As for cauterization with butter, you take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or a shell, then you take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the end of the spatula, dip it into the boiling butter, and place it on the aching tooth quickly; hold it there until it cools.
Then you repeat this several times until the strength of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. If you wish, you can dip a piece of wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth; put the heated iron above it so that the heat reaches deep into the tooth.
And as for cauterization with fire, you take a copper or iron tube—its body should be somewhat thick so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth; then you heat up the iron rod shown [in Figure 3], place it on the same tooth, and hold your hand there until the rod cools down. Repeat this several times.
Then the pain will go away either that very day or the next; after the cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with good butter and hold it there for an hour before spitting it out. This is a picture of the iron rod.
Cauterize with whatever end you wish, depending on what is possible; this is a picture of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterization of the scrotum.
If the scrotum is caused by phlegm and cold moisture, and it does not respond to maturation with medicines; if you want a quick maturation, heat up the hollow iron rod shown here which has openings at both ends.
To let out the smoke during cauterization, place it [the cautery iron] protected on top of the same swelling once and again if needed until you reach the depth of the swelling; if the swelling is small then make the iron equal to its size.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton pad soaked in lard until what was burned by the fire goes away, then treat with ointment and lint until it is healed, God willing.

On cauterization for hoarseness of voice and dyspnea.
If moisture prevails in the bronchial tubes, especially when combined with a cold temperament, the patient should first be purged by cathartics; then cauterize [them] at the nape of the neck where the oesophagus begins.
Take care not to cauterize down to the oesophagus, and do not burn more than half of the skin; then cauterize [them] again at the junction of the neck where it starts to curve sharply downward. The iron should be pointed like a nail in the shape I described earlier.
Then treat it as mentioned before until healed, God willing.
Chapter 24.
On cauterization for diseases of the lung and coughs.
If the cough and disease of the lung are caused by cold moisture, and if the patient has no fever or phthisis, but [instead] a chronic condition, then cauterize two sites above the collarbones where they begin to curve downward gently and another one in between the breasts over the sternum.
The cautery is nail-shaped as previously described, and if you wish your cauterization may be done by dotting with the instrument called 'the point', whose image has already been presented in dotting for earache. The dots should number about thirty.
Then treat it as previously mentioned until it heals. You may make a cautery with three prongs in this shape, and hasten the cauterization because you can cauterize three areas at once with it. This is an image of the cautery.
Chapter 25.
In axillary cauterization.
If the head of the humerus dislocates due to slippery moisture, or it is not set in place when reduced from dislocation until this becomes a habit of recurring dislocation, then it dislocates with the slightest movement as we have observed, the jaw should be opened first. Then the patient should lie on his back or on their right side, and then lift the skin inside the armpit upwards with your left hand if the joint has dislocated inwards.
Then heat the cautery with two prongs, which is depicted thus.
Then cauterize the skin with it until you penetrate to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will be four cauteries. You may also use a three-pronged cautery, in which case the shape will be six cauterizations, and the prongs should be as thin as veins.
This is an image of the three-pronged cautery.
And one may be added to this number, making eight cauterizations; then the crushed bulbs with salt are applied on the cautery sites. The patient is then obliged to rest and not move the affected limb for some time until it heals. If dislocation is upwards, which rarely happens.
A cauterization, or several punctate cauterizations with a nail-shaped instrument over the shoulder results in strengthening of the joint, removal of moisture, and healing.
Chapter 26.
On cauterization of the stomach.
If the stomach becomes cold and moist, deviating from its normal state, with increased discharges into it, and treatment with various remedies is not effective, then the patient should lie on their back, stretching out their legs and arms, and three cauterizations are applied. A cauterization below the xiphoid process, equivalent to one finger's breadth, is applied with a nail-shaped iron. Two further cauterizations are then made on either side of this first one, such that the cautery sites form a triangle. They should be sufficiently spaced out to avoid any confluence in case of suppuration. The depth of each cauterization should reach two thirds of the skin thickness, and their shape should be circular.
In this manner and to this extent, without any addition.
Alternatively, you may cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the abdomen, following this same method.
The cauterizing iron used for this single, large cauterization should be circular in shape.
The stomach can be cauterized with dots for those who cannot bear the complete cauterization. This is done by marking dots on the stomach in the required quantity using ink, and then cauterizing it with a dotted cauterizer. It should then be treated with the treatment previously described until it heals.
Chapter 27.
In cauterization of the cold liver.
If the liver becomes painful due to cold, dampness, or excessive gas and deviates from its normal temperament, even after being treated with what we have mentioned in this section without improvement. The patient should lie on their back, and three dots should be marked with ink in this particular shape and size on the liver just beneath the ribs where the elbow ends.
Each dot should be spaced by the width of a finger, and the cauterization should follow the length of the body in a straight line. Do not press too hard with the cauterizer.
The depth of the burn should be half the thickness of the skin, no more. The patient should be standing while being cauterized, but if they cannot stand, they can lie down with their legs extended and arms raised. This is an image of the cauterizer.
You may use the knife-like cauterizer if you are careful and skilled, but be cautious not to burn too deep, as you might burn through the skin entirely and reach the intestines, which is possible because the skin there is thin.
Chapter 28.
In duck, burn liver with cautery.
If an abscess appears in the liver and you wish to determine whether it is located within the parenchyma or the capsule, then if it resides in the parenchyma, the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is within the capsule of the liver, there will be severe sharp pain, and you see that its treatment has exhausted physicians, then the patient should lie down on their back, after which you mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the iron in the fire, this iron being of the same shape as a mile, here is its illustration. Burn it with one application of the iron until all skin is charred, and end by cauterizing the capsule so that all pus will be released; then treat as you would an abscess until healed.
This type of cauterization should only be undertaken by those with extensive experience in the medical arts, and who have repeatedly treated such diseases experimentally; then may one attempt this procedure, though abstaining would be preferable.
Chapter 29.
On cauterization of fistula.
Early authorities have described cauterization with the root of thornbush for a cold fistula, proceeding as follows: Take one long dry thornbush root, choose the longest you can find and ensure it is about as thick as your finger; dip this in oil, then light it on fire. Then cauterize it with one application between the articulation of clavicle and neck, two small applications below carotid arteries and slightly towards the side under the beard; two large applications above breasts between third and fourth ribs.
Two cauterizations are also made between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly leaning backwards; another cauterization is done in the middle of the chest and one above the stomach. Three cauterizations from behind: one between the shoulders and two on either side of the spine below the cauterization that is made between the nipples.
You should not go deep with your hand when cauterizing, but rather it should be done on the surface of the skin superficially. Some ancient scholars mentioned that some people used an iron rod similar to a sword. They would heat it and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the tumor.
And the pus is drained as mentioned in liver tumor cases. And there is great risk in this kind of cauterization; either the patient dies instantly, or a fistula develops at the site that cannot be cured.
Chapter Thirty.
Cauterization of the spleen.
If you treat spleen disease with the aforementioned methods of treatment in classification and it doesn't work, there are three correct ways to cauterize: You can make three or four cauterizations lined up along its length.
They are done in the shape of liver cauterizations as previously described, and there is a space between each one equivalent to the thickness of your finger or slightly more. The iron rod should be similar to what was mentioned before for liver cauterization, you don't go deep when cauterizing, and the patient lies on their back.
The second way is done at the elbow; you lift the skin opposite to where the spleen ends on the patient's left arm, and your lifting of the skin should be as wide as their body so that the cauterizations are lined up with the length of the body.
Then insert the two probes very hot so that they pass through the skin on the other side, then remove the cautery iron and there will be four cauterizations; if you wish to cauterize with the other cautery iron which has three probes.
Then treat the cauterized spot after leaving it to discharge pus for many days; this is more effective than all other treatments that have been mentioned before.
Chapter 31.
In cauterization of ascites.
Cauterization is especially beneficial for ascites with edema, if you treat the patient with various treatments as mentioned in the chapter and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize them four times around the navel and once on the abdomen.
Another cauterization on the liver, one on the spleen and two behind their back between the scapulas; one opposite their chest and another opposite their abdomen. The depth of the cautery should be close to the thickness of the skin. Then leave the cauterizations open to discharge pus for a long time.
Do not neglect the patient's treatment after cauterization; give them whatever is necessary to combine both treatments, so that recovery comes quickly. The image of the iron used for cauterizing the back should be nail-shaped as previously described and the one used for the front of their body should be olive-shaped.
Chapter 32.
In cauterization of the feet and legs.
If the feet swell in a patient with ascites and fill up with yellow fluid, then cauterization should be done on the back of the foot at the depression between the little toe and ring finger.
Hold your hand with the cautery iron and do not bend it. Then lift your hand and never bring it back, for [the wound] will discharge yellow water. The cautery iron should look like this.
Then cauterize on both legs in two places, each leg twice. The cautery should be done with the blade-like end of the iron and it should extend along the length of the leg; one above the knee and another below towards the middle of the leg. On each thigh, there will also be two cauteries.
Leave the cauterized areas open, without treatment, for a long time until it discharges water. Then treat them with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If diarrhea is caused by cold and moisture, weakening the digestive and absorptive powers of the stomach and intestines, and treatment with various remedies has not been effective, but you find the patient can tolerate cauterization and they are physically strong, then cauterize them with a large iron on their stomach. As explained before, cauterize the stomach with a circular iron and four light cauteries around the navel using the gentle spiked iron. Apply one large cautery on the coccyx, or two if needed.
If you find excessive moisture and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize with one iron on the pubic bone and another on each flank. You might add two small cauteries close to the large one on the stomach. This treatment is very effective and beneficial, God willing.
Chapter 34.
On the cauterization of piles in the rectum.
If there are chronic piles in the rectum, either numerous or just one, and they consist of thick, cold humours or corrupted fluids, and treatment with what we have mentioned in the division is not successful, then cauterize the patient three times on the lower part of the spine, just below the waist, somewhat triangularly.
Cauterize under the navel to the depth of two fingers. If you judge that his stomach has become cold and his food is not being digested, and if you see his face becoming swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large iron, as before, and also on the liver. And another on his spleen with a cautery iron shaped like a nail. Leave the cauterized area open for some time, then treat him until he is healed, if God wills it.
Chapter thirty-five.
On the cauterization of warts.
After cutting it, if you cut the wart, heat up the cautery iron which is shaped like a stylus, then insert it while hot into the same cut-off wart, pressing hard with your hand until the iron reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If there are many warts, cauterize each one with a single cauterization as described above, then treat them with the appropriate ointment until they are healed. If you cauterize it with a large iron on a piece of cotton, this will be more beneficial.
Chapter thirty-six.
On closing the fistula which is in the haunch and its surrounding areas.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and procedure we have described in its proper place, and is afraid of it, perhaps he may be cured by cauterization. If a fistula occurs in one of the haunches and becomes chronic, with pus and noxious fluids issuing from it, then you must first probe it gently with a slender sound.
Then ascertain its depth with the sound, then heat up an iron which is shaped like a stylet; introduce it heated into the fistula in line with the direction of the tract and to the same extent as the probe has gone in. Then cauterize again and again until all those noxious substances are burnt out - once or twice or three times according to your needs.
Take care not to burn a nerve if there is one, or a large vessel, and if the fistula leads into the substance of the bladder or that of the intestine.
So take care of all these places, and you do this only if the fistula is in a fleshy place, and when you have judged that it will not break out again; then treat the place until it heals. If the place has healed over and no more material issues from it, and remains so for some time - then know that it has been completely cured.
And if the material does not cease, then know that it is still opening out again, or there is some damaged bone in its tract, or something of that sort which will be mentioned where appropriate.
Chapter 37.
On cauterizing the ureters.
If there is pain in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's intercourse decreases as a result, it is advisable to cauterize on both flanks over the kidneys with one cautery mark on each kidney using the studded cautery instrument mentioned earlier. We may even cauterize for a third time at the same site, resulting in three aligned marks; this would be more effective.
Chapter 38.
Cauterization of the bladder.
If there is weakness and relaxation in the bladder due to cold and moisture, such that the patient cannot hold urine, cauterize it once at the lower part of the navel over the bladder where pubic hair begins, and another on the right side of the navel, and a third on its left side.
After cauterization, leave a space on each side equivalent to the size of the tip of the thumb. Cauterize again at the lower back or twice if necessary; use the studded cautery instrument as previously mentioned.
Chapter 39.
Cauterization of the uterus.
If there is material in the uterus due to cold and moisture, causing hindrance to conception, corruption of menses, and difficulty with its flow or pain upon its arrival, it is advisable to cauterize three times around the navel as mentioned previously for bladder cautery. And one cauterization on the coccyx at the lower back or two if necessary, using the studded cautery instrument.
Chapter 40.
On dislocating the hip.
Humid and sticky humors may settle there [the hip] by mistake, becoming a cause for dislocation of the joint; its sign is that one leg becomes longer than the other when measured against each other, and you find in it a vacuum at the site of dislocation; therefore, the patient should be cauterized over the very hip joint itself with a cautery having the shape of a semi-circle.
After you have outlined with ink around the joint as it turns so that the same joint ends up in the middle of the circle, and use for cauterization a crescent-shaped iron similar to the one used for the abdomen; if this iron is not available, then cauterize three times using the large olive-shaped iron.
Make the cauterization as deep as the thickness of all the skin, then treat [the patient] until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter forty-one.
On cauterization for sciatica.
If there is pain in the hip joint, and its cause are coldness and moisture, and you treat it with what we have mentioned earlier but do not see improvement and this condition becomes chronic then you should purge the patient of thick humors using stinking seeds or prickly pear seeds among others.
Then you cauterize the patient, and there are two types of cauterization: either with caustic medications or by fire; cauterization using fire can be done in many ways, one being to apply three triangular cauterizations over the hip joint itself resembling this figure:
They should be as deep as appropriate, and the distance between each cauterization is to be about one finger thick; use an olive-shaped iron for this purpose. You may apply another cauterization in the middle over the head of the joint itself so that you have four in total, or if you wish you can just do a single cauterization using the semi-circle iron described previously under 'On dislocating the hip'.
For the circle to encompass all of the hip and burn through all the thickness of the skin, this is how cauterization should be done in sciatica if the pain is localized to the hip itself without extending into the thigh or leg.
If it extends into the thigh and leg, cauterize with two cauteries on the thigh at the place where the patient indicates pain. Perform one cautery above the heel four finger-widths laterally; the cautery tool should be chisel-shaped, and the depth of the burn should be equal to the thickness of the skin only.
If the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize as indicated with a needle-point three or four times or more if necessary. If the pain is felt below the knee toward the leg, cauterize there once using a chisel-shaped tool.
Take care in all your cauterizations not to burn any major nerve or artery, lest you cause the patient grave harm or a long-term affliction.
I have seen two cases where cauterization was performed above the heel, and it was carried too far, resulting in gangrene of the leg up to the foot, with perforation and corruption of the entire limb; diarrhea and death ensued thereafter. If the pain is present on both sides, cauterize them according to these very instructions.
Some ancient scholars have described a method of hip cauterization using an iron cup-shaped tool with a diameter of half a span; its rim should be as thick as a date stone or slightly less. Within this cup, there is another smaller one, and within that, yet another.
The distance between each cup should be the length of a thumb; they are open at both ends, and their height is that of one or two fingers. A handle made of iron is attached firmly to the cups, as shown in this diagram.
It is then heated in the fire until it reddens and sparks, then placed on the right hip area with the patient reclining on their healthy side. Three round cauterizations are performed at once, after which they are left for three days before being dressed with butter. The wound remains open for several days.
If the wound is very large, treat it with ointment until it heals. The author of this book states that this type of cauterization was rarely used due to its unsightly appearance and the trauma it caused, as well as finding few patients who could endure it. However, for those who can tolerate it, it is an effective form of cautery when applied in the right place.
Regarding cauterization with caustic substances, you should prepare two cups similar to those used for door latches, made from copper or iron.
Their edges should be raised by the equivalent of two finger-widths or so, and the distance between them should be approximately the thickness of a finger. They should be open at the bottom and closed at the top, held together in this manner.
Place them on the patient's right hip while they are lying on their healthy side, and bind their hand tightly. Then pour between the two circles some sharp liquid, which has been slightly warmed by the fire, and hold it there for an hour. The patient must endure its stinging and burning sensation, as it is akin to a fiery sting.
Until the stinging subsides, then remove your hand with the tool and wipe all over the hip with fresh water. Leave it for three days, applying butter to reduce burn discoloration; leave this on for several days until pus begins to flow - this is most beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold that can hold water as you did for the hip, equally effective. This is an acute condition and I have discussed its treatment in detail in my article on medicinal remedies.
Take one part each of saltpetre and quicklime, grind them together, and put them in a new pot with only one small hole at the bottom just large enough to admit a rod; beneath this place another glazed pot.
Pour over the saltpetre and lime enough fresh water to cover them by a finger's breadth after kneading them well with your hand, then leave the pot until all of the caustic liquor has drained into the glazed vessel below; collect this liquor and pour it over more fresh lime and saltpetre.
It then becomes very caustic, capable of being used in many medical procedures and for cauterizing all parts of the body because it acts just like fire itself; among medicinals that are also used to cauterize the hip are: thorn-apple, barberry honey, lime mixed with soap and rubbed on.
Galen relates a story about an ancient man's treatment for hip pain, sciatica and similar complaints; he speaks highly of it, claiming that no other treatment is needed as this remedy heals in just one application.
So highly does he rate it that he says a patient might be carried into the bathhouse suffering and emerge cured! The recipe is as follows: take some fresh Indian Hellebore, though if this isn't available you can use the dry but recently harvested kind; grind it finely with a little fat and apply to the hip where it hurts, or on the leg or thigh.
You stretch it and leave it for about three hours or until the patient no longer feels the burning sensation. Then, bring them into a bath; when their body is wet, put them in a tub. The pain will go away, and they shall be healed by God's will. If not, repeat this process after ten days.
They will be healed by God's will, and know that no one should use cauterization with these medications unless the body is first purged. Discorides stated that goat dung used for cauterization effectively treats sciatica.
Cauterization should be done as follows: take wool and soak it in old oil, then place it on the deep spot between the thumb of the hand and the wrist, closer to the wrist. Then, take dry goat dung.
Ignite the dung with fire until it becomes hot coals, then place them on the wool and leave them there until they cool down. Continue to repeat this process until you reach halfway up the arm towards the hip; the pain will cease by God's will. This type of cauterization is called "goat-dung cautery".
Chapter 42.
For cauterization of back pain.
Back pain can occur due to various causes, such as a fall, a blow, excessive purging, and so on. It results from the accumulation of cold, moist material in the back, which is why cauterization is only used for this particular type of ailment.
For back pain caused by the accumulation of cold matter, after purging the patient with stinking sowbane or similar, three rows of cauterization should be applied across the affected area on the back in a pattern resembling that of a table. Each row should contain five or more cauterizations; adjust this number according to the patient's tolerance and strength.
The cauterization is done with a point-shaped cautery iron, and if you wish, you can perform three or four cauterizations with an average sized nail-like cautery iron like this.
Chapter 34
On cauterizing the beginning of the hump.
This disease often afflicts small children, and the first sign in a child is that they experience shortness of breath when moving or standing up. You will also find at the end of their vertebrae a lump which has risen higher than the other vertebrae.
So, if you see this and want to stop it, cauterize it with a round-shaped cautery iron like this. The cauterization should cover both sides of the vertebra evenly, and if you wish, you can perform two or three rows of cautery around the vertebra with a point-shaped iron, making sure the points are close together. Then treat the area until it heals using the methods we have mentioned.
Be careful not to use cauterization on the hump that is caused by nerve spasms.
Chapter 45
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pain is caused by cold dampness settling in any part of the body, then when it occurs in the legs doctors usually call this gout specifically.
So, if cold gout is treated with the methods we have mentioned in this section and the pain does not go away, then cauterization will relieve it. This involves cauterizing around the joints of the legs many times after inducing vomiting, using an average-sized olive-shaped iron like this.
If you need to cauterize a spot on the face, do so with the cautery iron for spots. If the pain rises to the knees or to other joints—which often happens—then burn each knee three or four times on either side with this very cautery iron.
If you need more than this cauterization, burn it and do not deepen your hand with the cautery; rather, let it be toward the thickness of the skin only. If the pain rises to the hips or back, then use what we mentioned about cauterization in its proper place.
If the pain is only in the hands, cauterize around the forearms like two rows going around them. If the pain remains in the fingers, then cauterize each knuckle and the palm of the hand with one spot each. If the pain rises after a few days to the elbows or shoulders...
Burn them on either side and the patient should not be without good management and taking medications, for if he follows a healthy diet and expels phlegm then he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On cauterization for hernias.
If a hernia occurs in the groin and some of the intestines and omentum descend into the testis, being only an initial and recent case, then you should advise the patient to abstain from food for that day and take some purgatives so as to evacuate his bowels.
Then have the patient lie on his back before you and tell him to bear down so as to push out the omentum or intestines; then return these with your finger, mark with ink beneath the hernia on the pubic bone a sign like half a circle whose edges point upward toward the body.
Then heat this iron, which is pictured here.
It turns white and sparks, then return the intestines or tripe to its cavity. Next, an assistant places his hand on the spot so that the intestine does not protrude again. With the patient's legs apart and a cushion underneath him, another assistant ties up his legs.
Another assistant is on his chest, holding his hands. Then lower the iron to the same mark and press down with the iron standing straight; hold it until you reach the bone or repeat this once more if you do not reach it with the first [press].
Be careful to prevent the intestine from protruding while you iron, lest you burn it and thereby cause either death or great harm for the patient. Know that your work is unsuccessful if you do not reach the bone with the ironing; the irons for children should be delicate according to their size, as should those for adults.
After three days, treat the ironed spot with butter until the marks of fire disappear; then treat it with other ointments until it is healed. The patient should lie on his back for forty days so that the wound may close.
His diet during treatment should be such that it softens his stomach, to prevent the intestine from protruding when straining at stool or urination. If he wishes to get up after forty days, use a tight bandage and hold for another forty days; reduce fatigue, fullness of food and drink, and loud crying.
If this regime is followed, he will be completely healed by God's will. I shall mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its proper chapter, if God wills; as for a hernia that occurs elsewhere on the abdomen and has just begun, if you wish to prevent it from increasing then cauterize the hernia with a round iron according to its size. Let the skin that is burned be like two-thirds, then treat it as we mentioned; it will not increase, God willing. Some of the ancients have said to cauterize the hernia with a triangular cautery iron shaped like this.
After learning about the hernia with ink, and when you see a line that is horizontal on top of the hernia, and another one going down, bring your hand to the middle and perform one single linear cautery, and the first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter 46.
On cauterization of wounds.
If there is pain in some of the limbs due to a fall or a blow, and this pain persists for a long time without any relief from medication, it should be cauterized with a single point cautery iron; each limb should be cauterized according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And if the pain and numbness persist, then cauterize again after the first one; if it does not heal, repeat the cautery because such pains usually move from limb to another nearby, so you should keep up with them by cauterizing until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On cauterization of leprosy.
As for lepers, they may greatly benefit from cauterization, especially the kind of leprosy that is caused by putrefaction and melancholic humour.
If you want to cauterize it, look at it; if the leprosy is in its early stages and you have treated it as mentioned before, but it has not deteriorated or stopped, and you are afraid that corruption might spread all over the patient's body, then perform five cauteries on their head. One in the middle of the crown, one below towards the forehead at the end of the hairline, two on the temples, and one behind on the occipital bone; go over these points carefully with cauterization so that it has a slight effect on the bone.
And flakes will fall off, thus facilitating the exhalation of thick vapors; cauterize it as well on the spleen, in a manner similar to what we have explained before. However, if leprosy persists and becomes apparent, you should proceed with the cauterizations that we mentioned for the head. Cauterize the side of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, one large cauterization on the coccyx at the base of the tailbone, and another above it in the same area, as well as two on each hip. Two on each knee, one on each patella, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the clavicles, cauterize it at every joint of the fingers of both hands and feet with a single cauterization; as well as on each heel, and the ulna of each arm.
Take care not to burn the nerves at the back of the heels, you may cauterize one on the pubic bone, another on the stomach opening, and a third on the liver; know that the more you increase the number of cauterizations, the better and more beneficial it will be.
Know that the patient will not feel pain from cauterization, just as a healthy person would, due to their bodily numbness; and you should have cauteries of various sizes, both large and small, depending on the body part or joint, as explained before regarding the properties of iron.
Then treat the cauterization with fine caraway flour and honey and all other treatments until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-eight.
When cauterizing an anesthetized limb, if said limb does not heal after treatment with medications, ointments and dressings, cauterize the same numb limb with more cauteries according to how large or small it is; but let your cautery be slightly deeper in the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with the ointment until it heals; and some numbness that occurs in the hand or foot, in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerve which moves that limb may be cauterized to remove the numbness.
One should not attempt this unless they have an understanding of the anatomy of limbs and where nerves exit to move the body.
Chapter forty-nine.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
If the leprosy has progressed and no medical trick helps it, cauterize upon it with a cautery that is slightly deep according to how thick the skin is until the whiteness goes away and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil and aconite leaves; pigeon or woodpecker blood, one part of each mixed together, applied to a rag and the location is covered until it heals.
Chapter fifty.
On the cauterization of cancer.
If cancer is in its initial stages and you want to stop it, cauterize around it with a circular cautery as though tracing a circle; some wise men have said that a deep cauterization at the center of the cancer will suffice but I disagree because I expect it would ulcerate which has indeed happened multiple times.
The correct procedure is to cauterize it with a circular brand, as we mentioned, or with multiple brands.
Chapter 51.
Cauterization of abscesses.
If an abscess has been slow to mature, either because of the humor that produced it or due to the patient's age if they are elderly and have less blood volume, or perhaps because of the season, and you wish to hasten its maturation, cauterize all around it with many small brands.
Then leave it, for it will hasten to mature. If you wish to retard its maturation by cauterization, heat the brand that is depicted below.
Lower it into the center of the abscess until it penetrates the skin, and let the brand be on that part which is closest to the ground so as to facilitate the flow of pus. Then treat it as necessary until it heals.
Chapter 52.
Cauterization of gangrene.
Gangrene is a corruption that advances within the body, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood. When you encounter gangrene in a location suitable for cauterization with fire, heat many small and large nail-like brands according to what suits the area affected by the gangrene.
Cauterize it on all sides so that all corruption is excised and nothing remains of it whatsoever, then leave it for three days before applying crushed sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until all scabs are removed along with all corruption.
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth. If, after three days, you see that the flesh is growing properly without any corruption, otherwise repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas; sometimes gangrene can be treated using strong medicine.
It acts in place of fire, faster in its benefit. I have mentioned the treatment with strong medicine in the section on surgery; you can refer to that when needed.
Chapter 53.
On the cauterization of inverted and non-inverted nails.
This condition often occurs on the soles of the feet and is a rough growth that causes pain to the foot. Cauterization can be performed in two ways: either with fire or with sharp/caustic water (a corrosive solution).
When cauterizing with fire, you should use a hollow iron tool shaped like an eagle's feather (with a thin edge), heated to red-hot and made specifically for the size of the nail in question. Place this hot tool directly on top of the affected nail, then rotate your hand around it until the heat has reached deep into the nail bed.
Leave it for three days, during which time it will start to discharge pus. Then bandage the wound with a mortar and pestle preparation of wild marjoram leaves pounded together with salt; leave this bandage on overnight. It should then become detached from its root. Treat the affected area with an ointment that promotes flesh growth until it has fully healed. This is for non-inverted nails.
This condition also frequently occurs on the surface of the body, especially on hands and feet. You should take a copper or iron tube (or one made from an eagle's feather), place it over the nail or wart, then pour a small amount of corrosive solution into the tube.
Hold your hand and turn it with a slight pinch of your hand to make the edge of the tube act on the root of the nail, so that the sharp water finds its way to dive into the root of the nail, and the patient bears the sting of the sharp water for an hour.
Then you leave it, and the nail comes out with its roots; thus, you do one by one until all those in the body are dealt with. Then treat their spots after they come off with ointments that make flesh grow.
Chapter 54.
On cauterizing tremor.
If someone has tremors due to a chill affecting their nerves, quartan fever, or other causes, they should be cauterized four or five times on the vertebrae of the back, with each vertebra in between being cauterized too, and once more on the chest. And a cauterization on their stomach with the olive-shaped cautery instrument; thus, the tremor calms down and speeds up the maturation of the cold disease.
Chapter 55.
On cauterizing boils that occur in the body.
Foul boils may appear in the body due to cold, thick, and corrupt substances; thus, at their first appearance, they should be cauterized with a light touch on top of each boil using an acacia stick whose end was lit by fire or the root of long-leaved hellebore, or a biconvex lens-shaped iron.
Abscesses can also be cauterized at their first appearance in this manner, preventing them from increasing further; the causative factor dissipates and the patient recovers from it. However, it is essential that this occurs after the patient has been purged by venesection.
Chapter sixty-six.
To tie off the bleeding that occurs when an artery is severed.
Frequently, bleeding from a severed artery occurs in an external wound or when cutting into a tumor or cauterizing an organ and the like, making it difficult to sever [the blood flow].
If this happens to someone, quickly place your hand over the pulse of the artery, put your index finger on it, and press firmly until you can feel that the blood is being contained under your finger without escaping from it; then take several small and large olive-wood cauterizing irons and blow on them in the fire until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large depending on the wound and location where the artery has been torn open, lower the cauterizing iron onto the same vein after swiftly removing your finger and hold the iron there until the bleeding stops.
If the blood gushes forth when you remove your finger from the pulse of the artery and the iron cools, quickly take another iron from those that are in the fire and continue to do this with one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn any nerves that may be present there, as this could cause another affliction for the patient; also know that if an artery is bleeding it cannot be severed unless by one of four methods: either cauterization as we have said, or amputation if it has not already been cut. If it is amputated, its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop; either bind it tightly with thread or place upon it medicines that are designed to cut off blood flow and secure it firmly with bandages.
And for those who attempt to stop it with a ligature or by tightly binding with cloth, or by placing burning substances and the like, it will not cease to bleed except rarely. If this should happen to anyone, and neither doctor nor medicine is present, let them proceed immediately by placing the index finger on the very mouth of the wound as we have described.
It is tightly bound to compress the blood and cause it to drain from above the wound, over the artery, and onto the index finger which should not be removed by cold water, very cold indeed, always until the blood coagulates, thickens, and ceases to flow. During this time you must observe what is required in terms of cauterization or medicine.
Chapter Two
Regarding lacerations, punctures, venesection, and other surgical procedures.
Khauf said: "We have mentioned in the first chapter every illness that can be treated by cauterization with fire or caustic medicine, its causes and reasons, its instruments, types of cautery irons, and we did so by chapters from head to foot.
I will follow the same path in this chapter to make it easier for the student to find what they seek.
Before I begin, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains even more peril than the first in regard to cautery.
For this reason, it is essential to issue stern warnings because the work in this chapter often involves bloodletting, which can be life-threatening when opening a vein or performing incisions on tumors, abscesses, treating wounds, extracting arrows, incising stones, and other procedures that carry risk of harm, fear, and death.
And I advise you to avoid what may cause suspicion, for in this profession various types of people will come to you with different ailments; among them are those who are tired of their illness and have become indifferent to death.
Due to the severity of his suffering, the prolonged affliction, and the signs indicating death due to the disease, among them are those who offer you their wealth, hoping for a cure despite their fatal illness. It is not appropriate for you to assist anyone who comes to you in such a state.
Let your caution exceed your desire and eagerness; do not proceed with anything until you have certain knowledge, verified by you, about the outcome and its praiseworthy consequences. In all your treatments of the sick, employ advanced knowledge and forewarn them about potential outcomes and their impact on recovery.
Through this, you will gain praise, glory, and admiration. May God grant you wisdom, my sons, and guide you towards what is correct and successful; for that lies in His hands, there is no god but Him.
I have organized this chapter into sections, following the order of topics presented in the cauterization chapter from head to foot, so that finding what you need will be easier for you, God willing.
Chapter One.
Treating the build-up of fluid in the heads of infants.
This ailment often occurs in infants at birth if the midwife presses their head too forcefully, or it may also arise from an unknown hidden condition.
I have not encountered this condition in anyone other than infants; all those I've seen have succumbed to it quickly. Therefore, I believe we should refrain from treating it. Among them was an infant whose head filled with fluid and continued to grow larger each day. The boy could not bear to sit due to the swelling of his head and the increasing moisture until he perished.
This moisture may gather between the skin and bone, or it may collect beneath the bone on the peritoneum. If the moisture is located between the skin and bone and the swelling is small, you should make a single incision across the middle of the head, about two finger-widths long, to drain the moisture. This is an illustration of the scalpel.
If there is more moisture and greater swelling, make two intersecting incisions as illustrated below.
If the moisture is beneath the bone, indicated by open sutures on all sides of the head and water flowing inwards when you squeeze it with your hand, then you should make three incisions in the middle of the head as illustrated.
After making the incisions, all the moisture will be released. Then you should suture the incisions with cloth and bandages, and then dress it from above with a compress of oil and wine until the fifth day. After that, remove the bandage and treat the wound with cauterization and ointments. Do not leave the head unbound; instead, keep it tightly bound in moderation. Finally, feed the patient dry food with little moisture.
Until the member gains strength and heals, another way to treat it is by incising where you can see the bone of the swelling and where water collects. It may be at the back of the head or towards the front or on either side.
Incising should be done where the swelling is apparent and water has accumulated, but you must take care not to cut an artery or it will cause bleeding that could kill the patient alongside the release of moisture.
Chapter two.
Ligate the two arteries behind the ears known as al-hisayan.
Should one experience a severe attack affecting the eyes or chest, which becomes chronic and does not respond to medicinal treatment, then ligating these two arteries is the most effective course of action.
When you wish to ligate them, you should first shave the patient's head with a razor and then rub the area with a coarse cloth to make the arteries visible. Next, you must secure the patient's neck by tying it with their garment. Look for the place where the pulse beats; its location is behind the ears in two sunken spots which are rarely hidden except in some people.
Mark them with ink, then ligate them with a sharp scalpel all the way to the bone; this should be done across the width of the head. If you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery and slice it from below upwards, making the cut approximately two fingers' breadth in length.
If the artery is ligated, blood will spurt out in a pulsating manner forward and upward repeatedly. If you cannot feel the artery, then measure three fingers from the ear, mark this spot with ink and slice it open all the way to the bone. It should...
You may expect the wound to discharge up to six ounces of blood, although sometimes more or less is possible depending on how strong and healthy you judge the patient's arteries to be. Look at the wound; if any peritoneum remains attached to the bone, cut it away.
To avoid the formation of a hot swelling, secure the wound with a bandage made from linen rags; treat it thereafter with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Section on the arteries in the temples.
In a patient with chronic migraines or acute attacks caused by hot and humid conditions, and an increase in the temperature of the muscles around the temples, or severe and persistent headaches, and after treatment using various medical approaches has failed to provide relief, we have found that ligation or cauterization of the arteries in the temples, as described above, can be effective.
The procedure for ligation involves shaving the hair from the temples and identifying the pulsating artery that is visible there; it can usually be easily located by its pulse, although in some rare cases it may not be immediately apparent.
Alternatively, if it is very cold and the artery is difficult to see, the patient should wrap their neck with a piece of cloth and you should then rub the area with a cloth or apply a hot compress until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the scalpel, as shown in this illustration. Using the scalpel, carefully remove the skin until you reach the artery; then insert a hook and gently pull it upwards to extract it from beneath the skin, taking care to separate it from any surrounding connective tissue on either side. If the artery is thin, twist it slightly with the tip of the hook. Next, cut off a section of the artery that is long enough to ensure its ends retract and do not bleed when pulled; if it is not completely severed, there will be no bleeding at all. Then allow the patient to bleed until between six and three ounces of blood have been lost.
If the artery is large, it should be tied off at two places using a strong double thread; this should ideally be either silk or strings from a lute to ensure that putrefaction does not occur before the wound has healed and cause bleeding.
Then you cut the remainder between the two ligaments, and you do this either at that time or after a while; if you wish to cauterize it all the way to the bone with a double-edged iron cautery, until its ends are severed so as to serve exactly the same purpose or better, just as we said.
Unless the patient has a fever or is in a bad temper, because cauterization helps to remove moisture and thus makes it all the more beneficial; after ligating the arteries you should stuff the cavity with old cotton wool and bind it firmly with dressings; after release, treat with drying medicines that promote flesh growth and with bandaging until healing occurs, God willing.
If during the operation any bleeding from the artery occurs, you should promptly tie it either by cauterization or filling up the cavity with zinc ore and pressing your hand firmly until the blood stops flowing; if you have nothing else at your disposal then place a finger there until the blood coagulates.
The cavity should be rinsed with very cold water to reduce the inflammation, and it is then bound as required; a much easier method than ligating the artery is cauterizing the tendon using this double-edged iron after you have marked off its two ends using ink.
Heat it red hot and apply it to the bone so that the tendon is severed at two points, thereby ensuring a wider gap between its ends; for if it is cauterized in this way, it will never rejoin.
The two blades are sharp, resembling small scissors; but they should not be as sharp as a knife for if so, cooling will occur too quickly and the flesh will not sever fast enough. A little thickness in them is preferable because heat can then linger on their surfaces.
I cut the flesh quickly, and this action is better than any other, lighter and easier. The distance between the two knives should be about the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
In the treatment of excessive, persistent tear production in the eyes.
If the tears are persistent and flowing from the vessels on the outside of the skull, and no medical treatment or medication has been effective, and you notice the patient's face turning red. They feel a sensation like ants crawling on their forehead, and their eyes are weak and watery; the lashes have deteriorated, and their eyelids have become rough due to the sharpness of the tears. In such cases, early treatments resorted to this procedure, which they call "treatment with the sword," involving shaving the hair from the patient's forehead.
Then, you make three parallel incisions on the forehead, along its length; each incision should be about two fingers in length. The first is made in the middle of the forehead, aligned with the nose's length. The second is slightly further away from the muscle movement in the temple, and the third is on the other side.
You must be careful not to cut the two arteries on either side and keep your hand away from where the jaw connects. Each incision should be about three closed fingers apart, and you should have prepared sponge pieces or many dry cloths to absorb the blood.
Then, you insert a double-edged scalpel, as shown in this image. Starting from the incision next to the temple, you lift and separate all the skin between the two incisions along with the membrane on top of the bone using this double-edged scalpel. You then repeat this action from the middle incision to the third one before removing the scalpel. Also inserted into the first incision is another instrument called a sharp scalpel on one side and smooth, non-sharp on the other. This is its picture: .
The sharp side faces upward towards the meat attached to the skin, and its smooth side is directed toward the bone. Push it until you reach the middle incision and sever all the vessels that come down from the head to the eyes without cutting into the surface of the skin.
Then do the same in the middle incision to the other one, and after a moderate amount of blood has flowed out, squeeze those areas where the blood has congealed, then proceed into each incision with a plug of old cotton wool and place on it a pad that has been soaked in wine and oil or vinegar and oil.
To avoid hot swelling, on the third day you remove the bandages and use frequent poulticing with lukewarm water; then treat it with basilicon ointment of rose oil; and whatever else you would employ to heal wounds until it is healed, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In treating tears and discharges into the eyes from within the head.
When someone has experienced many severe, acrid and continuous discharges such that their eyes appear shrunken and small; their vision is weak; and the eyelids are ulcerated with loss of lashes from them. And there is in the deep recesses of the head a sharp, painful ache and paroxysms of sneezing; then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges are coming from many profound vessels; and the best treatment for it is this: order the patient to have his forehead shaved then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is in the deep recesses of the head a sharp, painful ache and paroxysms of sneezing; then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges are coming from many profound vessels; and the best treatment for it is this: order the patient to have his forehead shaved then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Raise the incision slightly to the side, beginning from the left temple to the right temple and cut down as far as the bone. Keep your hand away from muscles of both temples which move while chewing until all blood is dried by sponges.
Separate the lips of the incision with old cotton or a twist of linen, then tighten from above using bandages and soak the bandages in wine and oil so that no hot swelling occurs; once you loosen it and find the hot swelling has disappeared, you should scrape the bone until some flesh begins to grow.
Then treat it with the drying remedy that promotes flesh growth, such as a salve made from two parts wheat flour and four parts calamine; this should be applied to promote flesh growth in wounds like these.
Chapter Six.
Treatment for when something falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or something similar to it, such as iron and glass; plant seeds like chickpeas and pits, etc.; or liquid substances such as water, vinegar, etc.
If an animal falls into the ear, and it is a pebble or something similar that cannot grow in the ear, expose the ear to sunlight; if you see the pebble, drop some violet oil or lamp oil on it then try removing it with head movements or by sneezing with musk. Close the nostrils when you sneeze after placing a cloth or wool collar around your ear and stretching it upwards; often, it will be removed with this treatment. If not, try to extract it using fine forceps like those depicted here.
If it [the probe] comes out with forceps, otherwise attempt to remove it with a fine, flexible, blind hook. If that does not work, make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole well.
Plug the area around the tube with softened pitch mixed with oil, so that there is no way for air to pass except through the tube; then blow into it strongly and repeatedly until you have removed [the probe]. If this does not work as described above, take a small amount of nabatean gum or prepared bird lime and place it on the end of an ear curette.
After wrapping some tight cotton around it, gently insert the curette into the ear hole after drying the ear of moisture. If you fail to remove [the probe] by all that we have described so far then proceed immediately with incision before severe swelling or spasm occurs.
The incision procedure is as follows: first, cupping for the patient and withdrawing blood according to his strength; then sit the patient between your hands and turn their ear upwards, making a small incision at the base of the ear by its cartilage in the lowest position.
The incision should be made in the shape of a crescent moon until you reach the [foreign body], then remove it with any instrument at your disposal. Suture the wound quickly and treat it so that it heals.
If the object that has fallen into the ear is one of the grains that can grow and swell, attempt to remove it using the methods we have mentioned. If this does not work then take a thin, fine scalpel like so:
Attempt to remove that type of grain that has fallen into the ear, doing so only when you are certain that it has softened with the ear's vapors until it becomes several small pieces; then extract them with a blind hook or a delicate forceps or by suction.
As mentioned, it is easy to extract [the grain]. As for water that has entered the ear, the patient should first use a syringe or blow their nose; they should then fill their ear with some old cotton and lie down on the side where the water has entered. If this causes the water to come out...
If not, take many flat and smooth stones the length of your fingers; heat them slightly over a fire, and have the patient put one in their ear. They should hop on their other leg from that side and strike another stone against the one in their ear.
Continue doing this with one stone after another until all the water has been extracted; it is also possible to remove water by taking a piece of papyrus or feather, inserting one end into the ear and lighting the other end on fire so that most of it burns up; then repeat with another feather.
Do this several times until all the water has come out, or suck it out with a tube as described above for the stone; if there is an animal inside and its body is small like a flea or similar, then treat it in the same manner as mentioned previously; but...
If its body is large enough to be felt, try to extract it with forceps and hooks; this is easier than dealing with all other objects that get stuck in the ear... As for removing worms that have developed inside the ear after treating it as mentioned in the section on catarrhs without success...
You should look at the ear in sunlight; if you see any worms, remove them with forceps or fine hooks. If nothing is visible, take a tube like this one.
Narrow at the bottom and wide at the top; insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can bear it, then suck strongly. Do this several times until all the worms come out. If they do not emerge, seal around the tube with wax, as I described for stones.
If they still do not come out, use the ear drops I mentioned, which ancient authorities have tried for killing worms. You can find that in the chapter on ear drops. Pour oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument; here is a picture of it: [image omitted]
You can make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole and wide at the top. You may wish to have the nozzle inside the tube made of tight-fitting copper, or take a probe and wrap some cotton tightly around one end. [image omitted]
Then pour in the oil, juice or whatever medicine you want from among these remedies while the tube is still in place inside the ear. Next insert the probe with cotton on the end above it and squeeze gently by hand until the oil is forced into the interior of the ear and some sensation can be felt there.
The patient should be inside it, and whatever you pour into the ear has been warmed slightly over a fire; take care that what is dripped in is not too cold or hot as the ear cannot stand that.
Chapter seven.
On the treatment of sudden blockage in the ear.
Some children may be born with their ear canals unpierced.
Also, some people may suffer from blockage in the ear canal due to a wound or growth within it. This blockage can be deep inside the ear canal and not visible to the eye.
If the blockage is slightly outside of the ear canal and visible, it should be noted that blockages deep inside the ear canal are often difficult to heal. As for those which are visible, you should expose the patient's ear to sunlight. Examine it, if you see the blockage present then open it with a delicate scalpel which should appear as such: [image of a scalpel]
The tip should be slightly wide and have a limited thickness, while the rest of the scalpel is smooth on both sides to avoid harming the ear. If the blockage was caused by growth in the ear canal then you can use a delicate hook to grasp it before cutting it away with great care until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep inside the ear then take a delicate and smooth probe, warm it slightly over a fire, and insert it into the ear canal. If you feel resistance against the probe along with difficulty hearing for the patient, then rotate the probe gently.
Be careful to avoid damaging the membranes of the ear and insert a wick into the ear which is appropriately sized for the canal, you should have soaked it beforehand in Egyptian ointment. Continue this process over several days until you are certain that healing has occurred or take a dry wick instead, soak it in water then sprinkle powdered green vitriol upon it.
Apply the treatment and if you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot inflammation, it is necessary to remove the wick and replace it with another one that has been prepared in rose oil ointment made with almond oil until the hot swelling subsides. Then treat it until it heals.
If there is bleeding, soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear while continuing with other treatments that stop such bleeding as mentioned in the chapter on fomentations.
Chapter eight.
On the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry, and you should hold them with a hook or needle, then cut them at their roots with a scalpel before applying powdered zinc to the area.
If there is any bleeding, cauterize them with a small lentil-shaped iron; cauterization after cutting is best. The warts often return if their roots remain, and if you cauterize with fire it will burn the roots, preventing recurrence.
Chapter nine.
On the treatment of coldness in the eyelids.
Often, something resembling a cold sore in severity and hardness appears on the eyelids.
This is why it is called a 'cold sore', which is a buildup of thick moisture between the upper and lower eyelids. If the cold sore protrudes from the eyelid surface, moving in all directions, it is easy to treat by making an incision across it.
First, carefully peel it away from every side until it is completely removed. Then hang it on the hook and cut it off. If you cannot make a clean cut without cutting through the eyelid, do not worry as this will cause no harm to the patient. In case of a large incision, stitch it up and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, do not worry about it as the ointment will heal and repair it. If the eyelid margin is turned inwards towards the inner surface, turn the eyelid inside out and hang the margin on a hook without needing to make an incision, then cut it away from every side.
If you cut through the eyelid, it will cause no harm. Then wash the eye after removing the margin with salt water and treat the area with something that promotes healing until the patient recovers.
Chapter 10.
Treatment of entropion, which appears in the eyelid.
Entropion is a lump of flesh found in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it mostly affects young boys. It makes their eyes heavy and they often catch colds at dawn; they cannot bear to look at sunlight. Because tears flow quickly towards them.
And for this reason, you see them always leaning on their faces and sleeping on them; their eyelids are under the eyebrows, moist and swollen, with the entropion visible to the eye. When you press the area between your fingers, you can feel the entropion between them. The procedure is as follows: have the patient place their head in your lap.
Take a piece of linen and prepare a wick from it; make a circle out of this wick, large enough to enclose the entropion on every side. Place it over the entropion and press with your fingers from all sides in order to gather the entropion at its center.
Then, in the center of that moisture, make a transverse incision with a scalpel; this cut should not be wider than those made for bloodletting. In depth, however, you must incise through all layers of skin until reaching the scrotum.
In most cases, the scrotum will protrude from the incision as a white fatty mass; you then grasp it with a cloth wrapped around your fingers and extract it outwards while rotating your hand right and left until the testicle comes free. Be careful not to increase the size of the cut lest the scalpel touches the eye and injures it.
If the scrotum does not appear at first incision, you must increase it slightly with care until the scrotum protrudes; then pull it out as we described before. Afterwards, dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the wound, securing it with bandages. Some people prefer to crush salt instead.
Apply this salt inside the incision so that any remaining moisture is dissolved; then treat it until healed. If, however, a hot swelling appears at the site, you must treat it with soothing dressings until recovery.
Chapter 11.
On the types of eye enucleation.
If, on the eyelid of an eye, new eyelashes grow in an abnormal direction beneath natural ones and persist; they will harm the eye, causing various ailments such as constant tearing or relaxation of the eyelids, corneal opacity, and thickening to a degree that renders the eye useless.
Eye enucleation can be performed in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or using sharp medications as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery; or it may involve cutting and stitching, or even a probe, which I shall now describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap and then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it does not flip, insert a needle with thread from below the eyelid and pass the needle through with the thread from above, doing so near the very eyelashes themselves; pull the thread upwards along with the eyelid.
Turn it with a stick, then make an incision on the inner side of the eyelid away from the excess hair using a sharp knife, cutting from the larger tarsus to the smaller one; remove the thread and place beneath the eyelid a small pad of cotton or cloth, then mark the eyelid with ink.
It should be shaped like an ace of spades card, but the size should correspond to how much you want to lift the eyelid, as this can vary among people; some may require a significant portion of the eyelid to be cut away depending on its degree of droopiness.
Others may require less cutting, all depending on the degree of eyelid relaxation; then make an incision with a knife along the two marked lines, starting from the larger tarsus to the smaller one, and let each incision be near the natural eyelashes, about as thick as a stick.
Insert the hook into one corner of the skin and peel it all off, then join the two lips together with sutures using a thin wool thread; wipe away any blood and attach any remaining threads to the eyebrows with some sticky substance.
You can do this if you wish, or not; the sutures and threads will remain for about three to four days, then treat it accordingly. If you prefer, leave the wound unstitched and treat it with something that dries and contracts it, as the eyelid will rise when the wound heals shut; however, suturing is preferable.
This method of raising the eyelid has been mentioned by previous scholars, although it requires effort from the patient. It is a good procedure and carries no risk. Another approach to raising the eyelid is to mark an outline on the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have described. Then lift the eyelid with three hooks, which can be separated or grouped in this manner:
Then you cut away the excess eyelid with small scissors in this manner, cutting carefully:
If you are unable to secure the hooks, and they do not feel stable, take a needle with thread and insert it into the center of the outline. Then, introduce another thread close to the larger canthus, and a third one near the smaller canthus. Gather the threads between your fingers with care, then gently lift the eyelid.
Lift the marked skin as described previously, then suture the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals. If there is a hot swelling when you cut or incise, soothe that swelling with cirrhotic ointment or similar soothing salves.
Sometimes the lower eyelid may turn inward; in such cases, you should employ what we have mentioned about cutting, suturing, and raising using cauterization with fire or sharp instruments. Raising with fire or sharp tools is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and suturing.
The procedure with reeds is as follows: first, evert the eyelid and make an incision on the inner side as described earlier. Then, prepare two thin reeds or wooden sticks of a length equal to that of the eyelid, but less than half the width of a lancet in thickness.
I have trimmed both their extremities on each side where the threads are attached, then bring them together gently over what is left of the eyelid and firmly tighten both tubes from either end; leave it for a few days: the tightened skin will die, turn black and putrefy.
Until it falls off by itself, but if this takes too long then trim it with scissors and treat the wound until it heals. When it is healed, the eyelid will be raised, not puncturing the eyelashes of the eye. This is an image of the tubes which you must make in precisely this shape and these specific length and width:
Chapter 12.
On raising ingrown eyelashes with the needle.
If it is one or two eyelashes, the procedure consists of taking a thin needle and passing through it some fine smooth silk thread whose length should be about six inches; then gather its ends together and tie them in a very delicate knot.
Pass another even finer thread through the loop, tying its ends if you wish; then have the patient rest his head on your lap and sit near a window so as to see clearly this delicate procedure. Insert the needle with the loop into the root of the extra eyelash.
Pass it through the eyelid quickly so that it emerges above the normal eyelashes; then pull the thread upwards towards the loop and insert into said loop any excess eyelash, one by one if there are more than two.
Pull the eyelash out along with the loop, taking care not to damage normal eyelashes; should you fail to do so, gently tug the loop downwards using the thread that runs through it until said loop emerges from its original puncture wound.
Then return the hair into it and pull both ends; do this until they rise in the upper hole so you can see them with your eyes. Then untie the noose, remove the thread, take out [the hair] and tighten the eye, leaving it tightened for two or three days until the hair is fixed in place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add a long natural hair to it so that they can both rise together, or leave it until its length grows after some time, then you will be able to lift it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the treatment of strabismus that occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
The condition that causes this strabismus is called lagophthalmos, and it can be either natural or symptomatic. The symptomatic kind results from the healing of a wound, tear, burn, or similar.
To treat it, cut that healing tissue and separate its lips; place a linen wick between them, tie it until healed. It should not be treated with anything drying or astringent.
If you do that, the strabismus will return worse than before; instead use things that relax, such as fenugreek, and poultices with water in which mallow stalks, flax seeds, and eryngo ointment have been boiled, mixed with some fats, and applied to the wick for treatment.
The key to treating it is to use every trick in the book so that it does not heal in its original form, and the procedure we mentioned earlier serves only to partially treat strabismus rather than fully restore the area back to how it was.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the treatment of strabismus that is in the lower eyelid.
This strabismus which is from the bottom is called true strabismus and it can be natural or occasional. The occasional one results from a wound, cut or cauterization and suchlike things.
The method of treatment is to take a needle with doubled thread, pierce the flesh and go through from left to right until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh; then stretch this flesh upwards by means of the needle, cut it off with a broad lancet.
If the eyelid returns to its normal shape, well and good; otherwise take a stylus and place it over the cut, turn back the eyelid with it and make two incisions on the inside of the eyelid towards the end of the incision you made so that they meet forming an angle. When they have met, their shape will resemble this: [The text is followed by an Arabic diagram]
This shape is like the Greek letter lambda; then you remove that flesh to the extent which is sharp and lower than what follows the eyelid, then gather together the separated parts with two stitches of wool thread, afterwards treat it as we have mentioned previously by using relaxing medicines and twisting until it heals.
If strabismus is caused by a wound, stitching or cauterization, then one should make a simple incision without touching the eyelashes also as mentioned before and separate the lips by twisting as we have explained previously.
In conclusion, the treatment of strabismus whether it is from above or below follows the procedure according to what presents itself in terms of its structure as its appearance varies widely and one who has mastered this art finds ways of treating them with any means possible.
Until the form returns to its natural shape or approximates it, and the same illness guides you as to what action and instrument are needed in most cases.
Chapter 15.
Adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may cause many people to have the upper eyelid adhere to the white of the eye, preventing it from moving easily and hindering its natural functions. So you should insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid.
And you lift it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a delicate scalpel that is not as sharp as regular scalpels but rather slightly blunt so as not to disturb the patient during the procedure and prevent the scalpel from slipping and injuring the eye with its sharpness. The cutting should be done as if you are peeling off the adhesion.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the adhesion is completely healed, then wash the eye with salt water or instil into it a solution of zinc sulphate in water as drops. Afterward, separate the eyelid from the eye with a piece of cotton wick.
Apply over the eye a piece of woollen cloth soaked in egg white, then after three days use ointments until it heals.
Chapter 16.
Excision of the pterygium and excrescences on the eyelids.
There are two types of pterygium: the first is nervous, resembling a thin hard membrane; the second is non-nervous, resembling a white solid moisture which when touched with iron or hooked with a needle breaks apart.
If the hooks do not stay in place, there are two types [of procedures]. Both begin from the superior palpebral arch and gradually move until they cover the cornea and prevent light and eye movement. The method for cutting them involves having the patient lay their head on your lap.
Then they open their eyes and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then you hook the pterygium with a slightly bent hook and stretch it upwards. Then take a needle, insert a horsehair or cow hair and strong thread into it, bend the end of the needle slightly, and pierce it into the middle of the pterygium.
Pass the needle through and tie the thread to the pterygium, stretching it upwards and removing with the hair the part of the pterygium next to the pupil as if you were spreading it with the hair until the end. Then cut off any remaining tissue at the root of the eyelid using a fine scalpel or small scissors.
To avoid the risk of constant tear drainage, you may stretch out the pterygium with just a hook or thread as we said before and then peel it off with a scalpel. You can also use a smooth-edged knife like this one.
Take care not to touch the corneal membrane with the scalpel, as this can cause a rupture of the pupil. After cutting, place some powdered salt or scurf zinc in the eye and leave it for another day before treating it accordingly until it heals.
If the pterygium is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle into it or hook it, this type of pterygium can often be treated with medication as described in the classification section, and it will heal. If you want to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a gentle, smooth, finely-edged scalpel like this: And remove the pterygium with it from above, gently scraping. If you see that it loosens and crumbles, and the scraping has an effect, then drop some of your solution into the eye - either zanjari eyewash, or red eyewash, or powdered salt - and bind the eye shut until the following day.
Then, repeat the procedure until all is removed - unless you encounter a hot swelling in the eye; in this case, leave it and treat the hot swelling until it heals. Then resume scraping until it also heals. As for any protruding flesh of the conjunctiva...
If the protrusion is causing severe harm to the eye, then attach it to a hook and cut off some of it; do not overdo the cutting lest you cause excessive tearing. Then drop red or zanjari eyewash into the eye until it heals.
Chapter 17.
On the excision of granulation tissue and any excess flesh that grows in the eye.
In the eyes of some people, red, overgrown flesh may grow to cover the cornea or come close to it; sometimes even spilling over onto the eyelids. The eyelids themselves may even turn outwards, resembling wild roses.
The procedure is as follows: the patient places their head in your lap, opens their eyes wide, and you pluck out all of that red flesh with hooks suited to the purpose.
Or you may grasp it with forceps or tweezers, then cut away the flesh bit by bit until all of it is removed. Take care to avoid harming the eye during this process; use either a scalpel as described earlier for pterygium removal, or small scissors. Such as is used to grasp the cords and their appearance will be explained in the next chapter after this one.
So when you complete the cut, if both eyelids are removed, fill the eye with powdered salt or instill into it red oxide and similar caustic medications, and apply to the outside of the eye cotton soaked in egg whites to prevent hot swelling.
If any part of the eyelids remains and bleeding persists, which may cause hot swelling, leave the eye and treat it with medication to reduce swelling; then return to the procedure until healing takes place. Do likewise in the case of excess flesh that appears in the eye from this type of injury.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye, either by nature or due to illness, with iron instruments; do not undertake any of these procedures until you see that the organ can tolerate such an operation.
Chapter 18.
On grasping the cords from the eye.
The cords are red veins that grow on the eye and obstruct vision, causing the eye to weaken over time. First, examine whether the eye with the cords is strong and free from other ailments.
In that case, perform the procedure of grasping. Have the patient place their head in your lap; then suspend those veins using one or two hooks according to your skill level. The hooks should be flexible and fine, like this image:" [image]
Alternatively, use two double hooks joined by a single body, as shown in this image:" [image]
Then carefully pluck out those veins with fine scissors, and wipe away the blood now and then until you see that those veins have gone and all the blood has drained from them; take care not to harm the eye with the tips of the scissors, and let your work be done at midday facing the sun.
Be very careful in your work so as not to cut any other veins, and when you have finished, drip into the eye either green or red collyrium to consume with its sharpness what remains of the vessels; if it is not possible for you to extract all of them at that moment, then bind up the eye with a dressing to ease the pain.
Leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and you are sure that there is no more hot swelling, then repeat this same procedure on the eye until it heals; this is an illustration of these painless scissors.
And leave it [with the patient's head resting in a student's lap while another dries away any tears and examines closely both the front and rear of the eye, while you] are at work; originally, the eye was opened with fixed or triangular spreaders held by an assistant.
It should be sharp, and the patient's head rests in a student's lap while another dries away any tears and examines closely both the front and rear of the eye; you may choose to start extracting from the top or bottom of the eye, but it is best to extract two vessels on the upper side, one at the far end of the brow and the other nearer its beginning.
Hold the spreaders between your middle and index fingers, then hook the hooks underneath them; next take hold of them between your little finger and ring finger, and lift them gently so you can see that all the vessels have been raised, cut from below with scissors or a small lancet if you wish.
Insert the needle into the sinew, then tighten all the sutures until it rises above the wound, but do not cut them short; for blood and pus will come out on you.
Then cut with scissors what extends beyond the cornea from above and below, so that nothing remains embedded except in the cornea; if you can lift it off the cornea by peeling with the needle, do so, for this is better, though it may not be feasible in some cases.
And if you cut it, the pain in its socket will persist for days; let the pain subside and the hot swelling go down, then resume the operation.
Chapter 19.
On replacing the nasal cartilage.
Physicians call the nasal cartilage fistula; if you treat it with cauterization or sharp medication as described above, and it does not heal, there is no other way but to make an incision over the swelling when it has ripened and drain all the moisture or pus in it.
until the bone is exposed; if you see it has become rotten or blackened, then scrape it clean with this tool:
It is called the 'rough-headed' and is made of Indian iron; its head is round like a button, and it has been finely engraved like a file or rasp. Place it over the affected bone area, then turn it between your fingers while slightly compressing it until you feel that all the rotten matter has been scraped away.
Do this several times, then treat the area with drying and astringent medications; if the wound heals over, flesh grows back in it, the discharge ceases, and no recurrence is observed for forty days without any swelling or further complication.
Know that he has healed, otherwise there is no other choice but to return the fistula to the nostril in this manner: and that is by uncovering the bone again with either iron or sharp medicine. Once the bone is exposed, take a probe like so:
The end of the iron is triangular and its shaft conical, tapering to a point as you see. Place it on the bone itself near the canthus of the eye. Keep your hand somewhat away from the eye; then turn your hand with the probe until the bone is pierced through and the patient feels it.
When he finds that air escapes from it when he holds his hand over his nose, then treat the area with astringent and drying medications as I have told you. When the flesh grows back and the site hardens, the matter which used to drain outward will return into the nose; this should be less bothersome for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On the repair of an eyelid tear.
If the entire eyelid is torn but there is no damage to or loss of vision, it should be easy for you to treat the patient. Then cauterize at the margin of the wound; place a cupping glass on the back of the head without incision and suck gently.
Then apply to the eye a poultice made of acacia, aloe vera, frankincense and asphodel; bandage firmly over the eye with several compresses. The recipe for the compress is as follows: take many soft rags, fold each one four times, then make many compresses from them.
Place them one on top of the other according to what is needed for the eye; then bandage firmly with a strong cloth, applying the cupping glass again by suction only. Remove the glass and leave the eye tightly bound day and night.
If the bandage loosens during this time, it should be tightened. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night as we said. If you see that the eye has returned (to its normal position), otherwise, repeat the dressing, pads, tightening, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter 21.
On the excision of the eyeball.
If an eyeball becomes dislocated and protrudes outside the eyelids, resembling a removed eyeball, and this is unsightly for the person, thus requiring its excision, then proceed as follows.
Insert a needle at the base of the eyeball, from below to above. Then insert another needle with a doubled thread through it, passing it through from the orbit. Leave the first needle in place.
Then cut the doubled thread at its bend and tie it to a part of the eyeball around the needle, tightening it well. Leave the first needle in place and remove the second one with the thread. Place some woolen material soaked in egg white on the eye, leaving it there until the threads fall off along with the eyeball. Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it.
Allow the wound to heal, you may tighten the eyeball from all sides with a cloth bandage until it becomes more protruded. Then apply a thin lancet to its base, allowing the humour aqueous to flow and the eye to subside and shrivel in its socket. Then tighten it again until the wound heals.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of corneal opacity.
This ailment, known as kumna, is an accumulation of fluid in the eye resembling tears but not actually teardrops. To treat it, have the patient sit upright on a chair and then take hold of their head with both hands.
Gently move their head until you see the fluid gather at a point below your eye, where it will remain without moving and allow light to enter. This will enable the patient to once again view objects clearly as before. If this does not occur and the fluid fails to descend despite our efforts, we know that it is water. Should it still fail to come down following all of these steps,
If not, have the patient sit in front of you and then take a thin scalpel and make an incision above the corneal membrane just where the conjunctiva meets it at the cornea's circumference until the fluid is released.
Once the fluid is discharged, instil warm water mixed with honey or water boiled with fenugreek and honey into the eye, then continue to treat it using other methods until recovery occurs.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
As we have already discussed the different types of fluid and which are suitable for examination in a clear manner, you may take that as correct. You should now get the patient to sit across from you with their legs crossed facing a light source close to the sun.
Secure the healthy eye with a blindfold and tighten it well, then raise the eyelid of their affected eye using your left hand if it is on the left or your right hand if on the right.
You then place the tip of the probe near the cornea with a thickness like a writing pen, in the white part of the eye from the side of the smaller corner; you then push the probe with strength while turning it by hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel that the probe has reached an empty space.
The depth to which the probe should go is equal to the distance from the child's head to the edge of the black part, which is the cornea of the eye; you will see the copper in the same field of vision as the eye due to the clarity of the corneal membrane, then move the probe upwards towards where the water is.
Then press it downwards once after another; if water drains out immediately, then the patient will see what has been uncovered to his sight at that very moment with the probe still in their eye; then wait a little while before removing any more fluid without taking out the probe.
Once it stops draining, gently remove the probe while twisting it slightly with your hand; then dissolve some fine Andranian salt in the water and use this to wash out the inside of the eye, afterwards place a compress or cotton wool pad soaked in the solution over the outside of the eye.
You may add rose oil and egg white to the solution, bind it with a compress over the healthy eye; we and our contemporaries instead use ground caraway seed with egg white for this purpose. If the probe fails to enter due to the hardness of the cornea, some people have eyes that are very hard indeed. It is necessary to use the scalpel known as the "needle", of which this is an illustration: [image caption omitted]
With this you make a small puncture in the conjunctiva only, do not push too hard; simply tap it lightly for the probe to pass through as mentioned above. Once your work is complete, prepare a secure resting place for the patient where they can sleep on their back in a dark room.
One must refrain from all movement and coughing, and their diet should be composed of foods that soften the body's nature. The head must not be moved to the right or left at all, and the bandage should remain in place until the third day. Then it is removed in a dark room, and one's vision can be tested.
Present them with objects, then reapply the bandage until the seventh day. This should not be done during treatment or immediately after surgery; rather, it must be avoided before that time, as water rises quickly due to intense gaze.
If a hot swelling appears, one must remove the bandage before the seventh day and treat it with remedies to soothe the swelling. Once it subsides, then one's vision can be freed, and a veil should be placed over their face, training their sight from underneath for several days while still in that dark room.
They should leave the house gradually and adjust to their surroundings, but know that the pupil cannot forego observation over several occasions before proceeding with treatment. I have heard from some Iraqis who spoke of a special draining instrument used in Iraq to absorb water during surgery.
I have never seen anyone in our country use such an instrument, nor have I read about it in any of the ancient texts. It is possible that this practice has emerged more recently. Here are illustrations of different types of surgical instruments for those who may be unfamiliar with them: [insert image captions here].
They are made specifically of copper, with the tip being this particular thickness and having a triangular shape that is sharp.
Chapter 24.
On treating flesh growths in the nose.
Different fleshy growths may develop in the nose, some resembling a many-legged scorpion, others being hard and cancerous with a dark color, while still others are soft flesh without any discolouration.
If the growth is soft, benign and not cancerous, then you should have your patient sit facing the sun with his nostril open; insert a hook into that fleshy mass and draw it out; cut off whatever portion can be reached by means of a sharp small knife on one side only.
Keep doing this until you know all the flesh has gone; if some remains that cannot be cut off, then scrape it gently with one of the small instruments so as not to leave any behind; stop when bleeding becomes problematic or a hot swelling occurs.
If it is facing you and requires attention or if the swelling is malignant, then proceed to cauterize until blood flow ceases and all flesh has gone; after cutting, apply vinegar and water or spirits inside the nose; should it open up and moisture begin to drain down into the throat,
then you know the patient is cured; if moisture does not drain as it should, then realize that there are more fleshy growths higher up attached to fragile bones beyond the reach of your instrument for cutting purposes; in which case you must take a thread made of somewhat thick linen.
Tying many knots along its length, leaving about a finger's width or less between each; the patient should then find some way of inserting one end of this thread into his nostril using an applicator stick or whatever he can manage having made it like a bolt and drawing on it until it reaches the nasal cavity.
It comes out of his throat, and boys in school often do this, which is easy to do if one wishes; then the two ends of the thread are gathered, one end that came out by the mouth while the other remained inside the nose.
You then use the thread's knots to separate the flesh, doing so until you know that the meats have been cut by the thread's knots; then the thread is removed and placed in the nose after wiping away any blood with a wick soaked in Egyptian balm; this is done for three days or more.
So that the ointment consumes all that remains of the meat; then, as a final thing, insert into the nose a lead pipe for several days until it heals; if further treatment is needed to dry up any moisture, this can be used.
This is an image of the nasal dropper with which oils and medicines are instilled into the nose:
It is made of silver or copper, resembling a small lamp with an open spout and channel.
If you wish, the tube can be made closed like a reed, and the dropper's spout flat.
At the end is a handle as you see, which you hold when heating oil or other liquids and fluids in it.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Frequently, a wart grows on the tip of the nose; over time it becomes larger and more unsightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it at its first appearance and remove all of it completely. Then proceed with cauterization or apply a caustic medicine that acts as an alternative to cautery. If excision is missed until it becomes large, then examine it; if it has hardened into a stony mass, is pale in color, and is insensitive.
Do not approach it with an iron instrument, for it is a cancerous tumor, and I have often seen those who excised this tumor suffer from great harm as a result. Even if the tumor feels soft to the touch, is not pale in color, and you believe that complete excision might be possible. So purge the patient, cut it out without hesitation or delay, and treat the area with a drying, astringent agent until it is healed.
Chapter Twenty-Six
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If these parts become separated by a wound or the like, know that when such separation of these cartilages occurs, it rarely responds well to treatment except in certain individuals.
Whenever one of these parts is affected, examine the wound; if it is fresh and moist with blood, then approximate its lips by suturing them together before treating it to promote healing. However, if the separation has resulted in a clean-cut division between both sides, it is necessary to de-epithelialize each side by removing a layer of skin from its surface until it bleeds.
Then, approximate the two lips by suturing them tightly together and dust them with a powder composed of asafoetida and frankincense. Cover this powder with a layer of galbanum-containing ointment or another adhesive ointment, leaving it in place for two to three days before removing the sutures.
Change the medicine and leave it until the threads fall off on their own, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The description of suturing is to bring together separated parts in contact either by needles as described for abdominal suture or thread as previously mentioned.
Chapter 27.
On removing tumours appearing on the lips.
Many people have small hard tumours inside their lips, some resembling chickpeas and others smaller or larger. The lip should be turned outward and an incision made over each tumour; then it is to be hooked with a needle.
You cut it from every direction, then stuff the wound with powdered alum until the bleeding stops, and then gargle with vinegar and salt. Treat the area with a styptic until the wounds heal.
Chapter 28.
On cutting away redundant flesh of the gums.
Redundant flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients called epulis; it should be hooked with a needle or held with forceps and cut away at its base, allowing the resulting flow of blood to continue for some time before applying powdered alum.
Or one of the drying styptics; if this redundant flesh returns after treatment, it often does so repeatedly and should be cut away a second time and cauterized, for it will not return after cautery.
Chapter 29.
On filing the teeth with iron.
Coarse and unsightly crusts may form on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums; they can turn black, yellow or green. This can lead to decay reaching the gum tissue and disfigurement of the teeth.
The patient should sit between your knees, their head in your lap. You must scrape the tooth or molar where you have detected these crusts and this gritty substance until nothing is left of them; do the same with the blackness, greenness, yellowness and any other [discoloration] until it is clean.
If the condition disappears after the first scraping, so much the better; otherwise repeat the scraping another day and then a second time and third until you reach your objective. Note that molars require different types of scrapers with various shapes depending on what is required for the job.
Because the scraper used to scrape the inside of a molar is different from the one used on the outside, and still another kind for in between molars; each has its own shape. You should have all these types of scrapers ready at your disposal.
Chapter Thirty.
On Extracting Teeth.
You should treat a molar for pain using all available methods, and be reluctant to extract it; there is no replacement if you do extract it, given that molars are precious teeth. Nonetheless, if extraction becomes unavoidable...
If the patient is determined to have a molar extracted, you should make sure that it is indeed the painful one. Patients are often misled by the pain and believe that it originates in a different molar, leading them to extract a healthy one; only for the pain not to subside until they remove the diseased tooth. We have seen this happen repeatedly at the hands of barbers.
When the pain of a tooth is confirmed, you should then make an incision around the tooth with a scalpel that has some strength until you loosen the gum from every side. Then move it gently with your fingers or small forceps at first, little by little, to shake it.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps and have the patient's head between your knees, holding him steady so that he does not move. Then pull out the tooth in a straight line so you do not break it. If it does not come out, take one of those instruments and insert it underneath from each side gently, moving it as before.
If the tooth is hollow or has a cavity, you should fill that hole with a cloth and pack it well with the end of a slender rod so that it does not crumble when you grasp it with forceps. You must carefully incise all around the gum from every side.
Be careful not to break it, leaving part of it behind, as this may cause more harm than the original pain. Avoid doing what the ignorant barbers do in their extraction and rushing to remove it without using the methods we have described.
Frequently, they cause great harm to people, the least of which is that a tooth breaks and its roots remain intact or partially embedded. Or it may be removed with some of the jawbone, as we have seen many times before. The patient should then rinse their mouth with a wine drink or vinegar and salt. If there is any bleeding from the site, which often happens, you should then crush some zinc and pack it into the wound.
Otherwise, remove it if the cement does not help you. Figure of fine forceps that are used to move the tooth first: they should have long branches and a short handle, be thick so as not to bend when you grip them on the tooth. This is the figure of the large forceps.
They should be thick-handled, so that when you grip them they do not give way or bend; the branches should be short and made from Indian iron or steel, well tempered at the ends with teeth which interlock at the tip for a firm and tight grip.
The branches may also be made in the form of a file, which will likewise make them strong when gripping.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the extraction of root teeth and removal of broken jawbones.
If part of the root remains after extraction, you should place a piece of cotton dipped in oil on it for one or two days until the area relaxes, then introduce an elevator or forceps. Their branches resemble the beak of a bird called a roller, here is an image of the forceps.
They may be manufactured like a file internally, or as a rasp. If they do not succeed in removing it with these forceps you should dig at the root and uncover all the flesh with a scalpel, then introduce an instrument resembling a small lever which is depicted thus:
With a short branch and somewhat thick, but not too much so that it does not break. If the root comes out with this instrument then well and good; if not, assist yourself with these other tools which are depicted thus: the first has a triangular branch with some thickness.
Another elegant triangular figure.
And we may also employ this two-pronged instrument, of which this is the figure.
And with other instruments and iron tools, which we have previously mentioned in the inventory of dental equipment, we may also employ this large hook-like instrument, of which this is the figure.
The end of which is triangular and slightly curved, with a bit of thickness to prevent breakage, and it should be untempered. Know that there are many dental instruments, and other instruments in general are countless; an experienced and skilled maker may invent his own tools according to the requirements of the work and the diseases themselves.
For some diseases, the ancients did not mention specific instruments due to their varying types. If a bone in the jaw or one of the mouth's bones is broken or becomes infected, search for it at its location using one of these tools or tongs mentioned previously for extracting roots.
We may also employ this pair, as shown in the figure:
It should be slightly thick to secure the bone and prevent it from slipping until the bone is extracted, then we treat the site with appropriate medications for healing. If there's a small amount of putrefaction in the bone, remove its putridness and blackened parts until it becomes clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter thirty-two.
On the extraction of teeth that have grown on top of others.
If teeth grow in an unnatural way, the appearance is marred; this is particularly true when it occurs in women and slaves. You should examine to see if a tooth has grown behind another.
If you cannot remove the tooth with forceps or by pushing it out, and if it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument, which is shown here.
It is similar to a small beak, made of very sharp Indian iron. You should cut the tooth over many days due to its hardness and to avoid shaking other teeth. If it is protruding and firmly attached, use a file like this one from India.
It should be made entirely of Indian iron, with a very fine engraving on it, like the file used for making needles. File down the tooth gradually over many days to avoid shaking or dislodging other teeth. Then smoothen and shape it using some files.
If a tooth has broken and is causing discomfort to the tongue during speech, you should also file it down until the rough edges are removed, making it smooth and even so that it no longer irritates the tongue or impairs speech.
Chapter 33.
On securing loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loose and mobile due to a blow or fall, making it difficult for the patient to bite into any food without them falling out, you should first treat them with astringent medications. If this treatment is not effective...
The solution is to secure them with a thread of gold or silver, though gold is preferable as silver becomes blackened and decays after some time, while gold remains unchanged forever. The thread should be of medium thickness, just enough to fit between the teeth.
The illustration of the interlacing shows how you take the thread and insert its loop between two sound molars, then weave with both ends of the thread around the mobile teeth, be it one or more, until you reach the sound molar on the other side.
Then you weave back to the side where you started from, and gently yet skillfully tighten your hand so that it does not move at all. Make sure to pull on the thread at the roots of the teeth so that it does not loosen, then cut off the excess thread with scissors, gather them, twist them with pliers, and hide them between the sound molar and the mobile tooth.
So as not to injure the tongue, you should leave it like this, tightened for as long as possible. If it loosens or breaks, tighten it with another thread so that it may serve you thusly for a lifetime. This is an illustration of teeth and how they are interlaced in two sound molars and two mobile ones, just as you see here.
If one or two teeth fall out, they can be put back in their place and interlaced as described above, where they will remain. However, this must be done by a skilled dentist. Alternatively, a bone from the cow's leg can be carved into the shape of a tooth and placed in the empty socket. It is then tightened as we have said, and it will remain, providing long-lasting enjoyment.
Chapter Thirty Four.
On cutting the ligament that appears beneath the tongue, which prevents speech.
This ligament that appears beneath the tongue could be either natural, present at birth, or accidental due to a healed wound.
The procedure is as follows: open the patient's mouth and have their head rest on your lap. Lift their tongue, then cut that neural band transversely so that the tongue can be freed from its hold. If there is some rigidity or complexity in this process due to a healed wound, insert a hook into it and cut it transversely until the band is severed and the knots are untied.
Be cautious not to cut too deeply into the flesh and sever an artery there, causing excessive bleeding. Afterward, have the patient rinse their mouth with rosewater or vinegar diluted in cold water. Place a linen wick under the tongue, which the patient should hold each night.
To prevent it from healing again, and in case blood flow is excessive, place powdered zinc oxide on the area. If this fails to stop the bleeding, cauterize the spot with a biconvex iron suitable for such use. Then treat it with other standard treatments until the wound heals.
Chapter 35.
On removing the frog that forms beneath the tongue.
A small frog-like growth may form beneath the tongue, impeding its natural function or even causing an obstruction with bone filling up the mouth. To address this, open the patient's mouth facing towards sunlight and examine where the swelling is.
If it appears dark in color, or even black, and is hard without any sensation for the patient, do not interfere as it could be cancerous. However, if it leans towards being white with moisture present, insert a hook into it and cut it open gently with a scalpel, removing all of its contents.
If the blood is too strong while you are working, place powdered lead acetate on it until the bleeding stops. Then return to your work and remove the whole thing. Afterward, rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with the rest of the appropriate therapy until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Treatment of swollen tonsils.
And any other tumors that grow in the throat, which can include glands within the throat resembling those outside, called tonsils; if you treat them as mentioned in the section and they do not heal...
If the tumor is hard, dark in color and insensitive, do not expose it to iron. And if it is red, its origin thick, also do not use iron for fear of bleeding; leave it until it matures, either bursting from itself or be cauterized.
And if it is white, round and its origin thin, this should be removed; the operation consists in looking before you begin whether its hot swelling has ceased completely or diminished to some extent.
At that moment, seat the patient facing the sun and his head on your lap; open his mouth and take a pair of forceps in hand which will push his tongue down by means of this instrument (drawing follows).
It is made of silver or copper, thin as a knife; if you depress the tongue with it and see the tumor, take a hook and insert it in the tonsil, pulling gently outward without tearing any mucous membranes along with it.
Then you cut it with an instrument, which has this appearance. It resembles a pair of scissors but its two ends are turned inwards and the edge of each is very sharp. It can be made either from Indian iron or Damascene steel.
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel, which has this appearance.
It is sharp on one side and unsharpened on the other, so after cutting out one tonsil, you cut out the other in exactly the same way. Then, after the operation, you rinse your patient's mouth with cold water or vinegar diluted with water.
If there is any bleeding, then rinse with water in which pomegranate peel or myrtle leaves have been boiled, or something similar that has an astringent effect, until the bleeding stops. Then treat your patient to ensure they recover. Other swellings may grow in the throat other than the tonsils and these should be cut out using the same method as for removing the tonsils.
I treated a woman for a swelling that had grown inside her throat, tending towards blackness and with little sensation. It was about to block the throat entirely and the woman could only breathe through a narrow passage. She was unable to eat or drink water.
She was close to death, if she had survived another day or two. The swelling had grown two branches that emerged from her nostrils. I acted quickly and pushed a fishhook into one of them then pulled it so that a decent-sized piece came away with it.
I then cut it where I could reach from her nostril and did the same for what emerged from the other nostril. Then, with her mouth open, I pushed down on her tongue and pushed the fishhook into the same swelling, cutting off a piece of it. Only a little blood came away.
The woman's throat began to swell, and she immediately drank water and then ate some food. We kept cutting that tumor repeatedly over a long period of time; the tumor would replace what was cut until this situation lasted too long for both of us.
I devised a plan, cauterized the tumor inside her throat with hot irons to stop its growth; then I left that area and traveled away, never knowing what God did for her after my departure.
Chapter 37.
On the excision of tonsils.
The tonsil, which is also known as the grape, if it descends into the uvula and becomes swollen, white, rectangular, and elongated, then it's called a pillar; but if it's thick at its base and round, then it's called a grape. If treated with what we have mentioned in the previous chapter, yet treatment fails.
And I saw that the hot tumor had subsided from her, and she became thin; thus it is necessary to excise her tonsils. Any of them which are grouped together in a round mass without length, dark red, bluish, black, or devoid of sensation should be avoided during excision.
In such cases, there is a risk to the patient's health; thus if you see them in the manner I described with its whiteness and length, make the patient sit facing the sun, compress their tongue using the tool which will be explained later on, then insert the hook into the tonsil.
Pull it downwards, and cut it using one of the two tools mentioned earlier in the section on excision of tonsils; you should only excise what exceeds its natural size without exaggeration because if you remove more of them, this would damage their voice and speech.
Then, after the excision, you may use what we have described for the removal of the tonsils and treat them until they heal. If the patient is reluctant to undergo the procedure, then it is advisable to employ a clever approach to cauterizing without fear or hesitation. The method of cauterization involves using a sharp instrument; this can be done by placing the patient's head in your lap.
Then, depress the patient's tongue with the tool we mentioned earlier. Take some of the caustic water, which I described in the section on cauterization, and mix it with unslaked lime to form a paste that is neither too thick nor too thin. Fill the depression of this instrument with the mixture; here is an illustration: [image of the instrument].
The end of the instrument, where you place the medicine, should have a concave shape similar to that of a mortar spoon. You position the tool, with the medicine, on the uvula while the patient lies on their side; this allows saliva to flow out from their mouth and down their throat, preventing any from entering the esophagus which could cause harm.
Hold your hand over the medicine and apply pressure to the uvula for approximately half an hour until it turns black and the effect of the medicine subsides. As an alternative, you may wish to wrap a piece of cotton around a mortar spoon, dip the cotton in the medicine, and use this.
Insert the mortar spoon, with the cotton on its end, into the tube above until the cotton adheres to the uvula; repeat this process several times until you achieve the desired degree of cauterization of the tonsil. Then leave it be; after three or four days, the tonsil will wither and fall out. If necessary, reapply the medicine.
After cauterization, wipe around the tonsil with a piece of cotton soaked in butter and dry off any excess medicine from its surroundings. Then have the patient rinse their mouth with cold water; treat externally with compresses and internally with enemas until it heals. This method of treatment is safer than excision and less fearful.
The uvula may also be treated with a gentler method than cauterization and excision. It can be treated with fumigation in the following manner: take fuoding, hyssop, sage, rue, wormwood, chamomile, feverfew, and similar herbs; gather all or some of them together in a pot and cover with vinegar.
and boil [the herbs] in a pot sealed with 'hokhmah' clay, and make a hole in the middle of its cover. Place on it the hollow instrument made as follows: It is made from silver or copper...
Insert the end with the pomegranate-shaped knob into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to reach the uvula via the tube until the uvula swells considerably. Then repeat this several times until it shrivels up. Be careful not to do this treatment when there is a fresh swelling.
This often makes the swelling worse, so you should only do it when its hot swelling has subsided. If this instrument is not available to you, take a reed and attach an eggshell to one end of it to prevent burning the patient's mouth.
This is because the eggshell prevents the hot steam from burning the mouth, which makes this a good and safe treatment.
Chapter 38.
On extracting thorns and other objects lodged in the throat.
Often, a fish bone or a thorn becomes lodged in the throat; you should remove any that are visible and can be seen by pressing down on the tongue with an instrument.
To ascertain what is in the throat, and whatever may not be apparent and has become lodged within it, you should make the patient vomit before their food can be digested in the stomach; for something stuck there might come out with vomiting or else the patient swallows a piece of turnip or lettuce root.
Or they swallow a mouthful of dry bread or take a piece of soft sea sponge, tying it to a thread and then swallowing that; when it reaches the site of obstruction you pull on the thread sharply - do this repeatedly.
And often the thorn or bone will adhere to it and be drawn out; if it does not come out as mentioned before, then use an instrument made of lead in this shape: .
It should be a little thicker than a rod, with a hook on one end which the patient gently inserts into their throat while holding their head back and taking care not to touch their larynx lest it provoke coughing; instead, they push forward with it to dislodge the bone or thorn - or else the physician might insert it by hand,.
The patient is better able to insert it, since they know the location of the obstruction and can push downwards or draw upwards with the instrument as seems best until it comes out,.
Chapter 39.
On extracting leeches stuck in the throat.
If you have treated the leech as mentioned in the previous section on medicinal treatment and it has been ineffective, then look into the patient's throat when the sun is shining after pressing down their tongue with the instrument described to you,.
If your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook or with a gentle and firm forceps; if you are unable to do so then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat until it reaches close to the leech, thereafter introduce inside the tube an iron rod heated by fire.
Do this repeatedly, and the patient must abstain from water all day; then take a basin filled with cold water, open his mouth in it, rinse his mouth with it without swallowing any of it, and move the water around periodically with his hand.
For the leech will fall out of its place when it senses water; if it does not come out as described, then vaporize the throat with urine and galbanum using the instrument I mentioned for cauterizing the uvula; do this repeatedly until it falls out.
The method of action in cauterization is that you take a vessel with hot coals heated by fire, the vessel being covered by a lid which has a hole in its center; then attach the end of the instrument to that hole and place the incense inside, after which the patient must put his mouth on the other end of the tube and seal it tightly so as not to let any incense escape until he knows that the incense has reached his throat.
For the leech will fall out of its place, but if it does not then the cauterization must be repeated several times; meanwhile the patient should abstain from thirst and eat salty food with garlic without drinking any water -- this treatment is bound to make it come out. This is an illustration of an instrument for extracting a leech from the throat once it has been spotted.
It resembles grappling hooks as you can see, but it has this curve that enters into the throat; its two ends are similar to a bird's beak with the roughness of a file. Once it clamps down on something, it does not let go.
Another instrument is used to depress the tongue, which is a wide iron ring sized to fit within the mouth over the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth vertically on its side, keeping the mouth open against the patient's will and they are unable to remove it until it is taken out.
The instrument that opens the mouth in this precise manner has an iron ring, wide enough to fit within the mouth over the tongue.
Chapter Forty.
Which treats the treatment of abscesses, their incision, and drainage.
Abscesses are many and varied, as will be described one by one in this book. They differ in their incision and drainage due to two factors: the first is the type of abscess itself and what it contains in terms of humours.
The second factor is the location of the abscess in the body, as an abscess occurring in the head differs from one occurring in the buttocks, and an abscess in a fleshy area differs from one in a joint; each has its own rules for treatment.
There are abscesses that should not be incised until the pus within them has matured and is complete, while others should be treated before full maturation, such as those close to joints.
If an abscess occurs near a joint and is left untreated for too long, resulting in the surrounding area becoming gangrenous, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, leading to disability of that limb. Or the abscess could occur near a vital organ.
If you delay the treatment until full maturation, you risk damaging that vital organ. Or it could be close to the buttocks; in this case, you would treat it while still raw. It is essential to incise abscesses near the buttocks before complete maturation to prevent gangrene from penetrating deep into the anal region and causing a fistula.
When the wound becomes such that it does not heal, and you should know the time to open up tumors which have fully matured when pain subsides in the tumor, fever has gone away, redness and inflammation have decreased, and all other signs.
You should make the opening in the lowest possible position of the tumor to allow for easier drainage downwards, or in the thinnest part of the tumor where it is most prominent and projecting; when tumors occur towards the hands and feet, then you should open them lengthwise on the body.
In positions where muscles, tendons, nerves and arteries are present; in general, for all flat surfaces without flexure, if the surface is one that bends then you should open it at a position which allows for this movement. If tumors occur on fleshy parts of the body then it is better to leave them untouched.
Until it has fully matured as we have mentioned, for if you open it before that time then its pus will flow continuously and be very dirty and filthy; possibly the edges of the wound may harden up and the ulcer bed may close over. Some tumors must be opened across the body when necessary or according to what is required by the affected part.
In small tumors you should use only a single incision, but in large ones make wider openings or many incisions according to the size of the tumor; some tumors may require the skin over them to be scooped out and cut away if it has become like old cloth.
When it has reached the limit of what can be cured, such as often occurs in large carbuncles and abscesses; some of these may be opened with a three-cornered incision, while others are cut away like a holly leaf or armpit tumor.
And some are used with the circular incision and the crescent-shaped incision, and so on among incisions; and what does not have a head, such as smooth, flat tumors should be drained only by simple incision, and if the tumor is large and has gathered much pus and become swollen it is necessary to proceed gradually, not hastening to extract all of the pus at that time.
Remove some of it, then tighten the tumor on another day and remove some pus as well; do this repeatedly in stages until all the pus is expelled.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person, for the animal spirit often becomes weakened along with the pus being expelled all at once, so that perhaps the patient might die without your realizing it; therefore be very cautious in this matter.
After draining these tumors, you should clean the wound and examine it; if the tumor incision is small or the incision simple and single, use lint made from old linen or cotton; but if the tumor is large and the drainage incisions numerous...
...then you should insert a pledget into each incision until they connect with one another; and if some of the skin has been cut away from the tumor or hollowed out, it is necessary to pack this area with old cotton or linen floss without moisture, tightening it on the third day.
Then remove the packing and treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals; but if blood should issue while you are working, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a linen cloth in them, applying this to the bleeding area several times.
If bleeding persists, you should employ the remedies and treatments that we have described in many places throughout this book and its divisions; if it is wintertime and the tumor site has many nerves, you should soak dressings with a warm oil-and-wine preparation.
You place it on the spot, and if it is summer and the spots are fleshy, you should cover them with dressings soaked in water and oil or a mixture of water and oil, all cold. When the third day arrives as we said before, then you should remove the swelling and massage it.
You use for its treatment something similar until it heals, and this is what you need to know about the general treatment of swellings. As for the detailed way, I have mentioned each swelling and how to treat it, categorized and summarized.
Chapter Forty-One.
On incising swellings that appear on the scalp.
Swellings appear on the scalp, small in size and resembling tumors with thin walls like those of a chicken egg sac. Their types are many; some are fatty while others contain a moist substance similar to sludge.
Some contain a moist substance resembling bran and soup, while others are hardened and solid. None of them pose any danger in incising and extracting, unless you encounter an artery during the process.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe with an instrument, depicted below and known as a "madss," until you know what they contain. If it contains moisture, then make an incision lengthwise, simple and like this: [image of the incision].
Start the incision from line ~B~ to line ~C~. Once the moisture is drained, peel and cut away the entire sac that contained it, leaving nothing at all because often it returns if any part remains.
Soak a piece of cotton in lard-based ointment, if available; otherwise, soak it in brine solution and fill the wound with it. Leave it for another day as this will eat away at any remaining parts of the cyst. Then reapply the cotton with Egyptian balm once or twice more if needed.
Once you are certain that there is no trace of the cyst remaining, treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the swelling contains a fatty mass, make an incision like so: [diagram showing a series of cuts and then arrows indicating direction]
A hardened cyst with calloused edges - insert the hooks into the wound's lips and peel it away from all sides, making every effort to remove the membrane that encapsulates it. Should you encounter a severed artery, follow the procedure described previously; likewise for any tumours formed as a result of incisions made.
The treatment process remains the same as mentioned before, and incisions made on hardened tumours are simpler to perform since there is little blood or moisture present within them. Some of these head-based tumours found in certain people may contain no moisture at all - I have operated on one such tumour myself, located in [diagram showing a tumour's location].
The tumour in this elderly woman's head was like a hard, rough white stone - it could not be broken even if someone were to throw it at the ground; it would still cause a fracture. This type of tumour is unlike any other found on heads and is distinct from those usually seen in young boys' heads, which are softer.
Make an incision at the base of the ears, a simple cut, and ensure that you create pockets in their lower parts to allow for the drainage of any contents downwards; then treat them as necessary with appropriate therapies.
Chapter Forty-Two.
In the dissection of pigs, tumors that appear on the neck often occur in this area and under the armpits as well as in the groin region. They may also appear elsewhere in the body; some of these are single growths while others are multiple. Some develop from others.
Each tumor is encapsulated by a membrane specific to it, just as in cysts and head tumors, which we have described. There are many types of these tumors; some are hard, others contain moist matter, while yet others are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
Those that I have seen, which are in good condition upon palpation and whose appearance is close to the color of the skin, can be moved in any direction; they do not adhere to the neck nerves or veins nor are they depressed. It should be dissected by making a simple incision from above to below the body, in this shape: a line from point C to point B.
Peel it away from all sides, stretching the skin flaps with a hook or hooks, or many hooks if necessary, as we said for head tumors; extract it little by little while keeping it on a strap to avoid cutting any nerves or arteries, and let the scalpel not be too sharp.
So as not to increase the cut or disturb the patient and cause you to sever what need not be severed; should you cut a nerve or artery and this obstruct your work, place powdered alum or some hemostatic powder in the wound.
Compress the wound and leave it until the inflammation subsides, the wound relaxes, and suppuration begins; at that point, the bleeding stops so return to your work and finish it, then explore with the index finger for any remaining small tumors, which you cut out and excise.
If there is a large vein in the root of the tooth, it should not be extracted from its root but instead tied with a thick, double thread and left to fall off on its own without harm. Then, stuff the wound with old cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment, and treat it.
And if the tooth is extracted whole, it should be necessary to bring together the lips of the wound and sew them immediately after making sure that no remnant remains. If you see that there is a remnant due to the root of the tooth...
It should be necessary to proceed by cutting its root and base, and employing sutures as we mentioned. For teeth that contain moisture, they should be dressed simply where the area of maturation is evident, with the dressing placed on the lower side as previously stated.
After the simple dressing, apply ointment with twisting movements to consume any remaining decay. Once you see that the wound has healed, treat it with salves that promote flesh growth until it is fully recovered.
Chapter 43.
On cutting open the larynx for a swelling that occurs inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the larynx, but I have not seen anyone perform it in our country. This is how they described it: As for those with throat disease, they should avoid incising the larynx as it will bring no benefit.
This is because all the veins, lungs, and trachea will be affected. For those with a hot swelling in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no issue with the bronchus, then incising the larynx must be employed to escape from the harm caused by suffocation.
Therefore, if we wish to do so, we should make an incision in the larynx below three or four circles of the trachea with a small transverse incision between two circles, just as wide as an incision in the peritoneum but not in the cartilage. This is indeed a suitable location for an incision.
Since it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant, if the surgeon is cowardly, he should lift the skin of the throat with a hook and then make an incision in the skin until he reaches the trachea, avoiding any blood vessels that may be visible.
Then he should make an incision in the peritoneum as described, and can identify the trachea by the phlegm that comes out of it along with any rupture, as well as the loss of voice. The wound should be left open for some time; once the risk of suffocation has passed, bring together the edges of the skin wound.
Its outline is like that of the cartilage alone, and then one should use medicines that promote flesh growth until it heals. The author of this book says: 'The meaning of all these words we have narrated is as follows: when they see a patient whose throat has been blocked by any such tumor as mentioned above.'
If the patient is close to death and their life hangs in the balance, it will be necessary to make an incision in the larynx so that he may breathe through this wound somewhat and escape from suffocation. This is why they were instructed to leave the wound open until the most serious part of his illness has passed; this period should last three days or thereabouts.
Then, they were told to stitch and treat the wound until it healed. I personally witnessed a case of a servant who took a knife and used it to cut part of her trachea; when called upon to treat her, I found her groaning like someone who had been slaughtered. When I exposed the injury...
I found that the blood coming out of the wound was minimal, so I knew she had not cut an artery or vein and the wind was escaping through the wound. So I quickly sutured the wound and treated it until it healed. The only thing that happened to the servant was hoarseness in her voice; there were no other issues.
She returned to her best health after a few days, which is why we say that laryngotomy carries no risk.
Chapter 44.
On incision of the swelling that appears in the throat from outside, which is called pharyngeal elephantiasis.
This swelling, which is called pharyngeal elephantiasis, is a large mass that matches the color of the body and occurs more frequently in women; it is of two types.
It can be either natural or symptomatic; the natural type is untreatable, while the symptomatic kind has two subtypes: one resembling a lipoma and another similar to a tumor caused by arterial thrombosis, which carries risk when incised. You should never treat such cases with an iron instrument, except when the tumor is small; if you examine and probe it with a probing needle and find that it resembles a lipoma without being attached to any vessels, then you may perform an incision as you would for a lipoma. Remove it along with the capsule if it has one, otherwise excise all of it and then treat the site as necessary.
Chapter 45.
On the incision of lipomas.
Commodities have many types; all their kinds were mentioned in the division. It should be noted here the difference between a commodity and an abscess, for it is complex: I say that an abscess presents with heat and fever along with terrifying pains until the seething of phlegm subsides. The abscess then continues to grow, and at that point the fever and severity subside. A commodity does not present with heat or fever or pains; it is contained in a serous sac which acts as its own specific envelope and has skin-coloured tones. It starts out about the size of a chickpea and grows into something the shape and volume of an egg, but may be larger or smaller.
There are two types: either fatty or containing fluid, and the colours of the fluids are many as mentioned in the division. Therefore, when treating a commodity one should first probe it with an instrument called 'the sounder', as depicted in the chapter that follows.
Compare the size of the tumour to that of a bone, then remove the sounder and observe its wake; if liquid flows out regardless of colour, make an incision as simple as described for other tumours. If no fluid follows the sounder, know that it is fatty.
Make a cross-shaped incision upon it as I have informed you, then suspend it with hooks and carefully peel away the skin from each side; preserve the sac if possible such that you can remove it intact alongside the commodity.
If the sac tears while you work and it proves impossible to extract it whole, then remove it piece by piece until none remains; for if even a shred persists - be it large or small - the commodity will return with greater severity.
If it overcomes you and only a small amount remains, cauterize the wound upon finishing with some sharp, caustic grains; compress the wound and place something that reduces heat above it; treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If the tumor is large, mark its lips and treat it with something that causes healing.
If you encounter a large or small vein that threatens to bleed, quickly cauterize the spot with powdered verdigris and leave it compressed for two or three days until the wound suppurates and the blood calms down. Then return to cutting away what remains of the tumor.
Chapter 46.
On the forms of instruments.
Instruments that act in the incision and division; of these are three types of probes, large, medium, and small.
Large probe.
Medium-sized probe.
Small probe.
Made of squared-off steel, with a tight fit to speed insertion into tumors. These are the probes, also known as scalpel blades; they too come in three types: large, medium and small. Large probe.
Medium-sized blade.
Small blade.
Suitable for examining tumors, wounds and fistulas as well as hidden places to discover what bones or other things are inside them; they should be round, smooth and highly polished like a spindle, made from Chinese brass, Spanish steel, regular brass, iron or silver; the best of these is made from Spanish steel.
Probes may also be made from black lead and are suitable for exploring sinuses with curving passages, as their pliability allows them to follow those curves. These probes come in three types: long, medium, and short.
The size of the probe should be chosen according to the depth of each sinus and the width of its passage. The thickness of the lead probes should correspond to the dimensions of the sinus, wide or narrow.
A medium-sized lead probe:
A small lead probe:
Hooks, of which there are many types: there are simple hooks with one barb, and these come in three sizes - large, medium, and small; there are blind hooks, also in three sizes; there are double-barbed hooks; and there are curved double-barbed hooks. There are three types of triple-barbed hooks, and each type is suitable for its specific use. Large single barb hook: Medium single barb hook: Small single barb hook:
Large blind hook: Medium blind hook:
Small blind hook:
Large double-barbed hook: Medium double-barbed hook: Small double-barbed hook:
Figure: Large Hook with Three Barbs.
Figure: Medium-sized Hook with Three Barbs. Figure: Small Hook with Three Barbs.
These are the incising and slitting scalpels used for cutting open organs and tumors, of which there are three types: large, medium, and small. Figure: Large Scalpel.
Figure: Medium-sized Scalpel.
Figure: Small Scalpel.
The cutting edges of the blades should be kept sharp, while the other ends can remain blunt. The latter is done so that they may be used to peel away an organ when there is a risk of cutting an artery or nerve, and also to give some comfort to the patient as they will feel less pain during the removal of the tumour.
These are the probes, which also come in three types: large, medium, and small. Figure: Large Probe.
They should be made of copper, similar to the applicator used for eye ointments; at one end there is a wide spoon-like feature with two layers, and within its head is a scalpel blade hidden inside resembling a bird's tongue which can slide in and out as you wish, as shown.
These are the scalpels that can be held between the fingers when cutting open tumours without the patient feeling them, and they too come in three types: large, medium, and small. Figure: Large Scalpel.
Images of the cautery instruments used to stop bleeding, which are of three types: large, medium and small. This is an image of a large one.
These cautery instruments are made of copper or porcelain, slightly elongated and flat. It is essential to have these tools available in different sizes - large and small - for quick bloodletting when necessary or when medication is not readily accessible.
However, these cautery instruments are not used for bloodletting in all areas of the body; they are specifically employed in fleshy regions such as the calf and thigh muscles, arm muscles, breasts, abdomen, groin area, and other similar soft tissues.
They may also be fashioned into smaller tools, akin to pistachio shells, as shown here:
These tools are used for bloodletting when bleeding occurs at the site of venesection or after severing a vein or artery. They can also be made round, as depicted here:
Chapter 74.
On the treatment of male breast diseases.
For those who dislike the appearance of male breasts, similar to female breasts, which may swell at a young age, resulting in an unsightly large chest - they should make an incision on the breast in a crescent shape as illustrated:
From line ~B~ to line ~C~. Then strip away all the fat, then fill the wound with healing ointment, then join the lips of the wound with stitches and treat it until it heals; if the breast sags downwards and becomes relaxed due to its bone, as happens in women.
You should make two incisions in its upper sides, resembling the shape of a crescent moon, with each one connecting to the other at their ends so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one, like this:. From line ~B~ to line ~C~, then you strip away the skin between the incisions and remove the fat; and use what we have mentioned of stitches, ointments, and whatever else is needed for treatment until it heals.
If you do not manage to remove all that needs to be cut, due to the patient's agitation or because of bleeding, then it is necessary to pack the wound with cotton soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it eats away any remaining fat; then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Eight Forty.
On incising tumours that occur under the arm.
The tumours that occur under the arm are of the hard cystic variety, enclosed in a sac; some contain fluids. Those which do contain fluids should be incised with an incision resembling a crescent moon like this.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~, then when it has discharged all the pus from the tumour, pack it with old cotton and leave it until the next day; then remove the cotton.
Treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type known as 'pigs' nodules,' then make an incision upon it, as we mentioned for incising pigs' skin. If the wound persists and the pus continues to spread, use cauterization as described previously.
Chapter 49.
On incising the tumor that appears before an artery or vein, which is called aneurysm.
If the artery is wounded and the skin above it heals, this often results in a tumor; similarly, if the vein is affected, it can result in swelling and a tumor.
The signs by which a tumor and swelling can be recognized as arising from an artery or vein are as follows: if it is from the artery, the tumor will be oblong and deep within the body; when pushed with your finger, you will feel a pulsating sensation.
A tumor arising from the vein will be round and on the surface of the body; incising these tumors is dangerous, especially in the armpit, groin, neck, or other sensitive areas of the body where they are very large; it is advisable to avoid treating them with iron.
Those which are also located in the extremities or on the head should be avoided as well; if it is a swelling of the mouth of the artery, make an incision upon it lengthwise through the skin and then open the incision with hooks before stripping the artery free from the surrounding tissue.
Once it is exposed, insert a needle underneath and pierce through to the other side; then draw the artery taut with thread tied at two points as previously described for extracting the arteries from the temples; make an incision with a scalpel between the two ligaments until all blood has drained out.
The tumor is dissolved, and then you should use a treatment that generates pus until the membranes fall off. Then treat it with appropriate salves until it heals.
If the tumor is due to a rupture of the vein, you should take as much of the tumor and skin as possible in your hand. Then introduce a needle below where you have taken it with your hand, piercing it with a doubled thread until you bring it out on the other side. Then tie the tumor securely with the thread, as I mentioned to you for tying a grape, on both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads will slip, introduce another needle with another thread under the entire tumor where the first needle crosses it.
Tighten the threads in four places, then make an incision down the middle of the tumor until all that is inside comes out. Then cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied. After this, place on it a dressing you have soaked in wine and oil. Then use the treatment of friction and salves until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor that appears due to nerve compression.
Just as a tumor appears in an artery or vein due to a blow, excessive strain, or the like, so too does a tumor appear in a nerve; this is most often seen at the wrists and heels.
In every place where the joints move, there is a hard tumor resembling the rest of the body. In most cases it is painless, and if pressed firmly the patient will feel something like numbness. The tumor does not lie deep in the body.
It is beneath the skin, moving in all directions and not going forward or backward. Those that are in the joints should not be treated with iron, for it might cause lameness. But those that are in the head or forehead...
Incise the skin with a scalpel, and if it is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it off at its root; but if large, suspend it on a hook and strip it away, then remove it and bring the edges of the wound together by stitching it up, treating it until healed.
Chapter fifty-one.
On the excision of warts that appear on the abdomen.
Many people have warts on their abdomen and the rest of their body, called *fungal* because they resemble mushrooms in shape: thin at the base and thick at the head with an inverted lip; some are small while others grow very large indeed.
I have seen a man with two warts on his abdomen, resembling mushrooms in shape and colour; they were very thin at the base but thick at the head with an inverted lip that had split open; moisture constantly oozed from them, and I excised both: one weighing around eighteen ounces, the other six.
To excise a wart, consider the patient's condition: if they are moist and the wart is white and thin at its base, incise it with a broad scalpel; have red-hot cauteries ready as blood will often flow heavily upon excision.
If blood proves difficult to control, cauterize the wound immediately; if the patient is fearful of the iron, take a lead suture and tie it around the wart as described above: leave it for two days then increase tension on the lead until you have pulled it off.
Whenever the wart is affected so that it stops and falls off on its own without any effort, if the wart has a thick root then there may be some fear and risk in cutting it, especially those located in the abdomen; however, it might still be possible to cut half or part of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent its return, and then treat the wound until it heals. Be cautious about cutting a wart that is dark in color, with little sensation and an unsightly appearance; for it is a cancerous tumor, and we will discuss cancer later on.
Chapter 52.
Treatment of the umbilical hernia.
An umbilical hernia can have many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum on the abdomen, causing omentum or intestine to protrude as in other types of hernias; or from blood being released from a vein or artery as previously discussed; or from trapped gas.
If the cause is a rupture of the peritoneum and omentum protrusion, the tumor will appear flesh-colored, soft, painless, and visibly distinct. If the cause is protruding intestine, it will be even more distinct as described. When pressed with your fingers, it disappears then returns; there may also be gurgling sounds and it becomes much larger when going to the bathroom or experiencing severe fatigue. If caused by moisture, it remains soft.
It will not disappear when pressed by hand, nor increase or decrease in size. If caused by blood, the tumor appears black alongside these signs. If due to overgrown flesh, the tumor is firm and solid, remaining at a constant size.
If it is due to wind, its touch will be soft. In such a case, one should refrain from treating it as there is fear and risk involved, as I have previously informed you in the chapter where I discussed tumors arising from the artery and vein.
If the tumor is due to the intestine or omentum, then you should instruct the patient to restrain themselves and stand erect with their body stretched out. Thereafter, outline the entire navel using ink. Then, instruct the patient to lie down on their back with you by their side. Subsequently, incise around the navel at the spot marked with ink using a wide scalpel. Stretch out the center of the tumor upwards using a large hook, and then tie the incision site securely with a strong thread or silk suture.
The suture should be tied in a loop knot. Then, open up the center of the stretched tumor above the suture and insert your index finger into it while asking for the intestine; if you find that the suture has grasped it, loosen the loop knot and push the intestine back inside the abdomen. If it is omentum, stretch it using a hook.
Cut off its excess portion, and if you come across an artery or vein, bind it tightly; this is a good practice. Return to your work and take two needles with strong threads attached to them. Insert the needles into the incision you made around the tumor, crossing them at right angles, then pull the tumor towards the needles in four different spots.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the tightened flesh becomes gangrenous and falls off on its own or cut it away once it has softened and become gangrenous. Afterwards, treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals completely; this method is applicable when the tumor originates from overgrown tissue within the navel.
If there is moisture in it, you should scoop out the tumor as we have said and remove the blood or moisture that you find within it, then treat it with something to seal the wound.
Chapter 53
In the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medications, warning against treating it with cauterization for fear of ulceration; we also spoke about cancer that originates in the uterus and warned against treating it.
The ancients have stated that when cancer is in a position where it can be completely removed, such as cancer of the breast or thigh and similar organs capable of expelling it whole, especially if it's in its early stages and small; however, if it has advanced and become large, you should not approach it.
I have never been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that; the treatment, if it is accessible as we said, is to proceed by cleansing the patient of black bile multiple times, then make an incision if there is an obvious fullness in the veins.
Then you make the patient exert themselves until they are capable of enduring the treatment, afterwards you apply suitable hooks to the cancer and scoop it out from every side along with the skin thoroughly so as not to leave any remnants of its roots; allow the blood to flow, do not stop it quickly.
Instead, you should squeeze the area and drain all the thick blood with your hand or any available tools; if during treatment a great amount of bleeding occurs due to cutting an artery or vein, cauterize it until the bleeding stops then treat it using other methods until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Four.
In the treatment of ascites.
We have explained in the previous chapter about types of ascites and how it occurs, along with signs and symptoms of each type as well as its treatment with medication. The type that is treated by cauterization (with iron) is only the serous type while neither the tympanitic nor the fleshy type should be approached with cauterization at all.
For this is deadly, so if you have treated this serous type of ascites with medication but it did not work then look: has the patient become very weak or do they suffer from another disease besides ascites such as...
cough or diarrhea and the like, then you must avoid treating it with cauterization for that is hazardous. If the patient appears strong, has no other disease but ascites alone, is neither a child nor an elder then direct your treatment such that the patient stands between your hands. And a servant behind him squeezes the patient's belly with their hands and pushes water downwards towards the pubic region. Then, take a spined scalpel shaped like this...
Sharpened on both sides, long and pointed at the end like a scalpel except it is slightly blunted so as not to harm the intestines during treatment. Then look: if ascites was caused by the bowels...
Then the incision should be made to the left of the navel, three fingers' width downwards towards the pubic region. If ascites was caused by liver disease then your incision should be 3 fingers to the left of the navel. If it was caused by spleen disease then make an incision on the right side, 3 fingers away from the navel.
One should not also make the incision on the side where the patient wishes to lie down, lest the exudates flow into that weak spot; then perforate through all layers of skin with an instrument and insert it in this wound and lift your hand.
Using a knife, separate the skin from the fascia as if you were skinning it; the amount of skin to be peeled off should be equivalent to that of a fingernail or so; then perforate through the peritoneum until the knife reaches an empty spot—the spot of water accumulation—then extract the knife and insert into this hole the instrument shown in the figure below.
It is somewhat like a tube made from a slender reed, crafted out of silver or copper or smooth, polished bronze; at its base it has a small hole and on its sides three holes—two on one side and one on the other—as you can see.
The end of it may be sharpened to resemble that of a quill, as shown in the figure below:
Through the loop at its top end, when the instrument reaches water it will immediately flow onto the instrument; thus you must drain an adequate amount of water in due time because if too much is drained within a short period, then the patient may die as a result of dissolution of their animal spirit.
Or he may become faint, approaching death; drain according to his strength and as indicated by the state of the patient—the strength of their pulse and the goodness of their color—then extract the instrument and retain water within them because it will cease flowing from that moment onward.
Due to the skin blocking the hole in the peritoneum, which you were instructed to close as described; then reinsert the instrument another day if you feel that the patient can withstand it.
You also remove very little water; do this for several days with the patient lying on his neck, and be careful not to make any mistakes until only a small amount of water remains. If you fear that the patient is in danger and have left too much water, then treat him by burying him in warm sand.
Excessive sweating in the bath and sun, enduring thirst, and treating him with drying medications until he recovers, cauterizing over the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water as described previously.
Chapter fifty-five.
Treating children who are born with their urinary orifices unperforated, perforated too tightly, or in the wrong place.
Some boys may be born with their urethral orifice unperforated; therefore, you should hurry to perforate it as soon as he is born.
With an extremely thin lancet like this:
Then you place into the orifice a thin leaden peg, bind it tightly in position and retain it for three to four days; whenever he wishes to pass urine remove the covering from him, then replace it; if you do not use this leaden piece there is a chance that the passing of urine over the area will prevent its closure.
As for those whose orifice is too narrow, they are treated with lead as we have mentioned for many days until it widens; and there may be some born with the orifice located at an incorrect place, like near the end of the penis where he cannot urinate forward.
such that he has to raise his urethra with his hand above, and one born like this cannot ejaculate forward; this is a very ugly condition, and the method of treatment for it is that the patient should lie on his back.
Then, with your left hand, you stretch the urethra vigorously and incise its head with a blade or a sharp scalpel that is like the size of a reed pen or as if you were carving something so that its middle is raised and resembles a vault; make sure the hole is in the center where it should be.
Be mindful of blood loss while performing the procedure, as it often occurs. Address this by applying a hemostatic agent and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter 56.
In the blister that occurs on the foreskin, urethra, blackened, damaged and adhered to the glans.
This blister often occurs in the urethra and is a fleshy protuberance, some of which are malignant while others are not. For the non-malignant type, it should be lifted with a fine hook.
You cut it out completely until you excise it, then take a piece of cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment and apply it to it; afterward, treat it with the palm-tree ointment until it heals. But if the blister is malignant and has an offensive color, you should use cauterization after cutting it open and scraping its contents out.
If the blister is on an uncircumcised foreskin, and part of it appears inside while the rest is outside; you should remove that which is inside first until it heals. Then afterward, treat what remains on the exterior.
Because, if you were to treat both at the same time, there is a risk of perforating the foreskin; this may also occur in the testicles and discoloration of the foreskin. You should excise all that has become discolored or damaged.
Then smear honey over it, along with crushed and sieved pomegranate skin and kirsana, then treat the wound using other methods until it heals. If there is bleeding, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped iron:
Cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, meaning bleeding and infected wounds. If the glans is eaten away completely at some point in time, you should insert a lead pipe into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it. As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans...
This adhesion occurs in those with an intact foreskin who have not undergone circumcision. It can also result from injury or swelling. You should remove the foreskin with a blunt knife until the ligament is loosened and the glans is freed on all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish between the two during examination, you should remove some of the glans and foreskin. The foreskin is thin, so it may tear quickly due to its fragility. Then separate the foreskin from the glans with a thin linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water, so as not to cause further adhesion.
It should then be treated with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter 57.
On the cleaning of boys and treatment of errors that may occur.
Circumcision is nothing more than separating the connection, like any other surgery, except that since it is something we do intentionally and use especially on boys, we must outline the best method for performing it.
And the easiest way to ensure safety, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws; but rather, it is something we have acquired.
By experience, for I have found that the majority of artisans and barbers use razors and scissors for cleansing, and they use tourniquets, threads for tying, and cutting with nails; and I have tried all these methods.
I did not find anything better than cleansing with scissors and tying with thread, because cleansing with a razor often causes damage to the foreskin, as it has two layers; perhaps cutting the upper layer leaves the lower one intact.
This leads to further cutting and pain, while cleansing with a tourniquet does not prevent damage to the urethra as it might enter its hole. As for cleansing with nails, perhaps the foreskin slips away and your work is ruined; or if the boy's foreskin is naturally short...
Many boys are born that way and do not need cleansing, I have seen this myself. But using scissors and tying with thread has been proven to be the best method through experience; for the blades of the scissors cut evenly because they are the same length.
When you squeeze the scrotum with your hand to align both blades, it is cut evenly and quickly; this way, the thread becomes like a wall around the urethra from all sides without any error whatsoever. The first step of the procedure is to prepare the boy.
Especially if the boy understands, you must tell him that you are only tying his urethra and will stop for today; promise to finish another day, cheer him up, and do whatever it takes to please him as long as he agrees. Then have him stand before you.
Do not sit down, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot; never let the child's eyes fall upon it nor on any of the instruments. Then introduce a hand into his urethra, inflate the skin, and roll it upwards until the meatus comes out.
Clean it of any dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked spot with a doubled thread and below this make a second ligature. Take hold firmly between your thumb and forefinger at the lower knot, and cut between the two. Then rapidly roll the skin upwards and expose the meatus, then let some blood run out; this is better and reduces the swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, and sprinkle on some ash from burnt dried gourds: that's the best thing I've ever tried or flour made from beanstalks, which also works well.
Then rapidly roll the skin upwards and expose the meatus, then let some blood run out; this is better and reduces the swelling of the urethra. Then dry it with a damp cloth, and sprinkle on some ash from burnt dried gourds: that's the best thing I've ever tried or flour made from beanstalks, which also works well. Over the top of the powder, place a cloth with half an egg boiled in rosewater and whipped up with fresh good-quality rose oil; leave it there until the next day, then treat him using all other methods until he is healed.
This is an image of the scissors used for circumcision:
The scissors should be blunt, cutting, without any distortion; the blade is sharpened to a point and its length matches that of the handles equally. But if you make a mistake during circumcision, perhaps reversing the foreskin completely or partially at the time of incision then with your nail right away, stretch it back before the place swells.
Cut it evenly; if you can't hold the skin with your nail, then catch and pull it with a hook before cutting it off. If three days pass and what is under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed leave it until this hot swelling subsides, then peel it gently away.
Cut it according to what seems appropriate for you, and be cautious of the head of the urethra; if a part of its head is cut off then that won't harm [the patient], so treat it with whatever will heal the wound from among the powders we described in our article on powders.
If too much of the skin is cut off and it shrinks upwards, this will not harm significantly either; treat it with what we have mentioned until it heals.
Chapter 58.
On treating urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to a blockage caused by a stone, clotted blood, pus, tissue growth, or similar; if you treat this with what we have mentioned regarding the described types of treatment in our classification system.
If the urine does not flow and you perceive that its retention is due to a stone which has impacted at the bladder's neck, then it should be arranged for the patient to kneel on their knees with their back bent; have someone else mount them from behind while stretching out their belly towards their back, and have the patient hold themselves as much as they are able.
This would force the bladder's neck to push the stone backwards, causing the urine to flow; if it still does not flow as we mentioned and the situation becomes severe for the patient then you should use a tool called a "catheter" that looks like this: [Insert image of catheter].
It is made of silver and must be thin, smooth, hollow like the tube of a feather in its thinness but long as around one and a half palms; have a funnel on one end while having a pull tab at the other; to use it for urine extraction take some folded string and bind wool or cotton well onto one end.
Insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut it with scissors if any wool remains to be inserted into the tube, block it like a button. Then grease the catheters with oil or butter or egg white and seat the patient on a chair.
And his bladder and urethra are lubricated with moist ointments or oil and warm water, then the catheters are gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra; then the urethra is bent upwards towards the navel, after which the catheters are pushed inside.
Until, when the urethra is fully bent, then push the catheters inside until it reaches close to the anus; then tilt the penis downwards with the catheters still inside and continue pushing them until they reach the bladder which the patient will sense as having reached something empty.
And this is done in this manner because the path that urine follows has turns and curves, then you slightly tighten the thread with wool so as to guide the urine flow; subsequently you extract it while allowing the urine to pour out, and finally reinsert the catheters again.
Keep doing this until the bladder is completely emptied, which the patient will sense as a feeling of relief.
Chapter 59.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
And the suitable instruments for this are made from silver or hollow ivory with a long thin tube like that of a syringe; if you want to drip water and medications into it, then this is done by an instrument called a syringe. This is its image: [an image caption follows].
They are made of silver or ivory, hollow with a long tube as thin as a twig; it is hollow throughout except for the end which is solid and has three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
The hollow spot in which the syringe is should be large enough to seal it without any excess, so that when you suck up some of the moisture, it gets sucked in; and if you push on it, [the moisture] moves out as far as an oil-syringe does when thrown into naval warfare.
So, if you want to remove the moisture from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and suck it up with the syringe; then the moisture will be sucked into the hollow tube of the syringe. Next, introduce its tip into the urethra as described for catheters, and push out the moisture with the plunger.
Then that moisture reaches the bladder, where it stands until the patient feels it; this is an illustration of a syringe for delicate use also used to irrigate the bladder:
It is made of silver or esparto grass, its upper part resembling a small funnel with a groove beneath it where the ligature sits; you then take a camel's bladder and fill it with the moisture that you want to irrigate the patient's bladder with before securing it tightly between the grooved parts using doubled thread.
You warm that moisture slightly over a fire and insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra, then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the moisture very tightly until the patient feels that this moisture has reached his/her bladder.
If you don't have a bladder, take a piece of thin leather and make it into a circle, then punch holes all around its circumference before threading tight thread through these as if you were sewing; gather the circle together like a bag after filling it with whatever moisture, ointment or water you want.
Then tie it to the instrument and manipulate it just as you did with the bladder, squeezing it by hand until moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the Extraction of Calculi.
We have previously discussed the different types of calculi and their treatment with medications, highlighting the distinction between those formed in the kidneys versus those developed within the bladder. I also outlined the indicators for each condition. Furthermore, we've addressed the instances where manual intervention or surgical incisions are necessary.
This refers specifically to calculi formed within the bladder, particularly those that become lodged in the urethra. I will elaborate on this with a detailed yet concise explanation.
Calculi formed within the bladder are most commonly observed in boys, and a key indicator is the presence of urine that resembles water due to its thin consistency.
Fine sand-like particles can be observed, and the irritation causes the boy to scratch and play with his penis. This often results in a downward movement followed by an upward shift, accompanied by the protrusion of the anus in many cases. Recovery is generally easier for boys until they reach the age of fourteen; however, it becomes more challenging for elderly individuals, while young adults fall somewhere in between.
Interestingly, those with larger calculi tend to have an easier treatment process, while smaller ones present more challenges. When it comes to treatment, the patient should first undergo an enema to eliminate all fecal matter from their intestines. This is crucial as it can hinder the examination for calculi.
The patient should be lifted by their legs and gently shaken downwards to facilitate the descent of the calculus towards the bladder's neck, or they can jump from a raised position multiple times. Subsequently, the patient is made to sit between your hands in an upright position, with their hands placed under their thighs, ensuring that the entire bladder is tilted downward. This positioning is essential for the examination.
Examine it from the outside; if you feel a stone in the space, promptly cut open on it. If it is not detected by your touch at all, then lubricate the index finger with oil from your left hand if the patient is a boy or the middle finger.
If he is a fully grown boy, insert [the finger] into his anus and search for the stone until you feel it under your finger; then gradually move it to the bladder neck, pressing on it with your finger and pushing it out towards where you wish to cut.
You instruct a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and another servant you order to stretch out his right hand upwards while with his other hand he stretches the skin under the testicles away from where the cut is going to be made. Then you take up the curved knife which looks like this:
You cut between the anus and testicles, not in the middle but towards the left buttock; the incision is made over the stone itself, your finger inside the rectum pressing it out obliquely so that outside the wound is wide while within it remains narrow as much as possible to allow passage of the stone.
Do not make [the wound] any bigger, for you may exert pressure with your finger inside the rectum on the stone during incision and it will emerge without difficulty; be aware that some stones have angles and edges which render their passage difficult.
Among them are some that are smooth like acorns, rounded and so easy to pass; but those with angles and edges you widen the wound a little further - if still it will not come out this way, then you must resort to stratagem: either grasp it tightly with forceps whose tip is serrated...
To secure the stone, so that it does not escape from him and either enter an instrument from underneath it which is fine and has a bent end, if you are unable to do this then widen the incision slightly; if anything from blood overpowers you then cut it off with alum.
If there is more than one, first push the larger one towards the bladder's mouth and then make an incision on it; afterwards push the smaller ones in that manner too. And if there are more than two stones, you will have to incise a bigger stone with a large incision because this may cause damage to the patient.
Either the patient will die or he may experience a constant discharge of urine because the wound will never heal. But try to push it out, if you are unable to do that then use forceps and break it into pieces so that you can remove it.
Once you have completed your work, fill the wound with myrrh, storax and costus, and bind it tightly; place dampened cloths on top soaked in a mixture of oil, wine or rose water and cold water to reduce inflammation caused by the heat. Then make the patient lie down on his back; do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
If the bandage comes loose, wash the wound with a lot of water and oil; then treat it with palm ointment and balsam ointment until it is healed. If there is an excessive hot swelling in the wound or something like that happens where blood coagulates inside the bladder preventing urine passage; this can be identified by the presence of blood mixed with urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood because if it remains, it will cause corruption and infection of the bladder. Then wash the wound with a mixture of vinegar, water and salt; treat each type accordingly until it is healed.
One should always bind the thighs together during treatment to secure the application of medication, especially if there is a small stone caught in the urethra, blocking urination. Treat it as I will describe before it reaches the glans penis.
This treatment often makes the incision unnecessary, which I have tested myself. Take a steel probe that looks like this [picture of the instrument is included here]:.
The tip is triangular and sharp, fixed to a wooden stick. Take some thread and tie it around the penis below the stone [i.e., urethral calculus] so that it does not slip back into the bladder. Then gently insert the steel probe through the urethra until you reach the stone with its fork.
Turn the probe with your hand, little by little, trying to pierce it through [the calculus] until you have passed through from the other side; urine will immediately begin to flow out. Squeeze what remains of the stone from outside the penis and it will crumble into pieces that leave along with the urine, and the patient is cured.
If this treatment is not available to you, then tie a thread below the stone and another above it. Then make an incision in the penis between the two threads right where the stone sits; from there, extract it.
Then untie the thread and clean out any clotted blood from the wound; binding a thread below the stone prevents it from slipping back into the bladder, while another above ensures that when you untie this after removing the stone, the skin returns to its place, covering the incision.
For this reason, when you tie the upper thread, it is critical that you lift the skin upwards so that upon finishing treatment, it returns to its original position and covers the wound, as we have described.
Chapter sixty-one.
The extraction of stones in women.
Stones are rarely formed in women, and if one of them has a stone, it is difficult to treat and impossible for many reasons. One reason is that the woman might be a virgin, and another is that you will not find a woman who allows herself to be treated by a physician.
If she is chaste or among those forbidden to marry, another reason is that you will not find a woman who knows how to perform this surgery, especially the manual work. The third reason is that the site of incision for removing stones in women is far from the actual location of the stone, and thus requires a deep incision.
And in that, there is danger. If necessity dictates it, you should find a female physician who is skilled and kind; they are rarely found. If you cannot find one, then request the help of a chaste and gentle male doctor or bring an experienced midwife for women's affairs, or even a woman with some knowledge of this surgery.
You bring her and order her to do all that you instruct, such as searching for the stone first by inserting a finger into the woman's anus to feel for the stone; if she finds it and can press it with her finger...
Then, you order her to make an incision in that spot. If the woman is not a virgin but rather married, then instruct the midwife to insert their finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone after placing their left hand on the bladder and massaging it well.
If the stone is found, it should be guided down from the bladder opening with as much effort as possible until it reaches the base of the thigh; then an incision is made on the front side of half the vagina at the base of the thigh where the stone is felt.
Her finger should not be removed from the stone, pressing down on it, and the incision should initially be small. Then you insert the sound into this little opening; if she feels the stone, increase the size of the cut to a point where you know the stone can pass through. Be aware that there are many different kinds of stones.
Some are small and large, smooth and rough, long or rounded, with branches; so know their types to understand what you need. If the bleeding troubles you, sprinkle powdered zinc oxide on the site and hold it there for a moment until the blood stops. Then return to your work.
until the stone is removed. Make sure to prepare the tools mentioned for extracting stones from men, so you can use them as needed. If bleeding becomes uncontrollable and you detect arterial pulsation in it, apply powdered styptics to the location.
Secure it firmly with bandages and leave it alone, without attempting to remove the stone; for her life may depend on it. Then treat the wound. Once the severity of the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area becomes gangrenous, resume your work until the stone is extracted.
Chapter sixty-two.
On incising the water cyst.
A water cyst is the accumulation of fluid in the albuginea, which is the white membrane beneath the scrotal skin surrounding the testicle, known as the scrotum. It can also occur within a specific membrane that nature forms on one side of the testis.
This may lead one to believe it is another testicle; it forms between the scrotal skin and the albuginea, as mentioned before, which is rare. A water cyst develops due to a weakness in the testes, causing this fluid to accumulate there. It can also occur following a blow to the testes.
This moisture can have many colors; it may be yellowish, or a reddish-brown, or dark black, and sometimes watery white. These are the signs by which to identify it.
When water accumulates, if it is in the white membrane we mentioned, the swelling will be round or slightly elongated like an egg shape. The testicle does not become visible because moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in its own specific membrane, then the swelling will be round on one side of the egg-shaped mass.
For this reason, one may think it is another testicle. If the moisture is between the skin of the testicle and the white membrane, then it can be felt under palpitation. To know the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square-shaped instrument previously illustrated; whatever comes out after prodding will indicate what is inside.
When treating with iron, you should advise the patient to undergo venesection if their body constitution permits it and I see that they are sufficiently robust; then they lie on their back, slightly elevated and place many cloths underneath them. Then sit yourself down by their left side.
You should instruct an assistant to sit by their right side, stretching the patient's penis towards one side of the scrotal skin and towards the direction of the hypochondrium region in the abdomen; then take up a broad knife and cut through the scrotum from its center down until near the pubis.
Make the incision in a straight line parallel to the axis which divides the scrotal skin into two parts, so that it reaches as far towards the white membrane where moisture is contained; then peel this away while being careful not to cut through any part of it and do your best to keep peeling closer to the side attached to the testicle; you should continue to peel for as long as possible.
Then you widely open the membrane filled with water and extract all of it, then you separate the lips of the incision with hooks, and stretch the membrane upward without touching the scrotum's skin and cut the membrane as best as possible either in one go or by cutting it into pieces.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not fully cut it there is a risk that water may return; if the testicle emerges outside of its skin while working on it then upon finishing cutting the membrane fold it back in and stitch together the lips of the scrotum's skin.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals; if you find the testicle is already corrupted from another disease then tie the vessels in the spermatic cord to prevent bleeding before cutting off the testicle and removing the testicle, after which treat it as mentioned above.
If the water is gathered in both sides, know that they are both hydroceles; make an incision on the other side as you did for the first one and repeat all of the above steps, if it suits you to do so in a single operation then proceed with doing so before cleaning up any blood.
Insert into the incisions some wool soaked in oil or rosewater, and add from outside another piece of wool that has been soaked in wine and oil; spread it over the testicles and lower abdomen then place on top folded cloths known as compresses. Secure it with the six-ended bandage that is illustrated as such: [image of a bandage configuration]
Take two cloths and sew them together, filling with fluffy wool; make the fastening ends from cotton or moist wool secured by a belt around the trousers; one end is then attached to the back of the patient.
The second one extends towards the pubic area and the two ends are placed on the thighs from below, while the remaining two ends are attached to the groins. All the tension is gathered in the waistband of the trousers. This support can also be made by cauterization instead of incision with an iron instrument.
It involves taking a fine, pointed iron and making an incision with it through the skin of the scrotum while it is hot, as described, until the white peritoneum containing fluid is exposed. Then take another iron in this same shape:
It is shaped like a Greek eye, and then use it to cauterize that peritoneum while it is hot until all the fluid has been discharged. Next, stretch out the peritoneum with hooks and peel off the layer of skin containing [the fluid] with the iron, cutting it as much as you can manage so that you remove all of it and take care not to let the testicle be touched by fire.
Be aware that this method is safer and less prone to bleeding than the surgical procedure, and it is superior to incision-based techniques. If you encounter any hot swelling or blood discharge during either the cutting or cauterizing stages, or if anything else arises, you should address each issue as it presents itself using the appropriate treatment methods outlined previously.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot bear this procedure due to its unsightliness, then he should employ cauterization as I will describe it, provided that you have confirmed his health based on the signs we presented earlier.
When the hydrocele is small, you should have the patient sit on a high chair and make an incision at the bottom of the swelling with a broad scalpel; arrange the cauterization irons lengthwise along the body, making the opening wide enough for all the fluid to drain out; then place some cotton wool over this area and bandage it tightly.
Leave it to drain the rest of the water, then treat it until the wound heals. If water continues to discharge at that time when you have punctured it and this can be due to the fact that the white membrane obstructs in the mouth of the wound thus preventing the water from flowing out.
Then it is necessary that you introduce into the wound a goose quill or the instrument which extracts water from lovers, as its image has been presented above, or enlarge the opening of the wound slightly.
And note that water may return and accumulate after about six months; if it accumulates, puncture it in the same manner, but the patient must avoid exertion for several days.
Chapter 63.
On incising the fleshy tumor and its treatment.
Note that incising this tumor is a dangerous procedure leading to death in most cases; thus, we recommend leaving it alone for safety's sake. However, I will discuss the operation and its various types of tumors.
There can be many tumors in the body where the testicles are formed, and this happens due to multiple reasons: either from an excess of irritant humors that flow into the testicles or from a blow; the tumor's color is similar to the body's skin tone, and there is no discharge.
The tumor can be hard or possibly stony, its color livid, and there is no sensation; it could result from the arteries becoming tangled and swollen as mentioned earlier or from the veins swelling. Any tumors arising from arterial swelling will gradually disappear.
If you press it with your fingers, which should not be done at all, and nothing dissipates upon compression, then this type of tumor is due to the veins swelling; this kind cannot be incised, nor can other fleshy tumors.
The method is to incise the skin of the testicle, then stretch the tunica vaginalis upwards and extract it from beneath the white membrane, freeing the spermatic cord from its vessels, ligating these vessels, and dividing the cord after separating it completely on all sides from the tunica. If the tunica has adhered to those growing tissues...
The tunica should be extracted and divided, even if adhesion has occurred between the membranes or among the vessels it is necessary to separate all such adhesions and excise them in a circular manner.
If there is a growth of flesh in the area of adhesion behind, then you must excise it all and extract the tunica as we have said. Once your work is done, pack the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with the usual remedies until healing occurs.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of hydrocele with involvement of the spermatic cord.
The spermatic cord is a twisted swelling with some torsion, resembling a cluster, and accompanied by relaxation of the testicles; the patient finds movement, exercise, and walking difficult. Treatment for this condition is similar to what has already been mentioned.
However, we should mention the procedure as described by earlier physicians. I say that you must seat the patient on a high chair then push down the spermatic cord and grasp the testicular skin between your fingers together with those vessels close to the penis.
An assistant should then grasp and pull it taut while you make a diagonal incision with a broad, sharp scalpel alongside the vessels so as to expose them; then separate them on both sides as previously described for extracting blood-vessels from the gums; next ligate them with a double thread passed through a needle.
Tie it at the first locations where the biceps tendon is exposed and tie it also at its end, then make an incision in the middle, a vertical incision along the length of the body to remove all accumulated foul-smelling discharge.
Then treat the wound with the treatment for other wounds where infection may occur during healing to remove the blood vessels that feed one of the testicles, which is not a problem; however, if all blood vessels are involved in the biceps tendon then it is necessary to extract one of the testicles along with its vessels so as not to deprive the egg from nourishment. Before cutting off the blood supply, the testicles wither and are no longer useful.
Chapter 65.
Treatment of intestinal hernia.
This hernia occurs due to an incision that extends through the peritoneum, which is found over the abdomen around the inguinal region on both sides of the belly button, causing the intestine to protrude from this hernia and descend into one of the scrotums.
This hernia can result from either an incision in the peritoneum or its extension, and these two types occur due to various reasons such as a blow, jump, yell, or lifting something heavy, etc. If it is due to the extension of the peritoneum, then it will develop gradually over time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is flat towards the depth due to the peritoneum squeezing the intestine; however, if it results from an incision in the peritoneum then severe pain occurs immediately at the start with a noticeable lump appearing under the skin near the scrotum.
This occurs when the intestines come out and are directed outside of the peritoneum, and sometimes the omentum comes out with them; this is called enteric and omental hernia. It may be accompanied by gas, and feces can pass into the intestine and become trapped there, which will bring about the death of the patient.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially if it is pressed, treating the different types of this condition with an iron probe is dangerous, so you should be cautious about using such a method. Instead, instruct the patient to return the intestines to their cavity by hand, provided that they can do so.
Then have the patient lie on their back, between your hands, with legs raised. Next, pull up the skin that follows the pubic region and make a longitudinal incision in the scrotum's skin; then insert hooks into both sides of the incision to stretch it open as needed.
Make the incision as large as possible to let the testicle out, then remove the peritoneum that lies beneath the scrotal skin until you expose white hard peritoneum on both sides; at this point, insert your index finger behind the testicle.
Insert it between the white peritoneum that lies below the testicular skin and another layer of peritoneum, then use your right hand to free any adhesions behind the testicle while you hold up with your left hand the white peritoneum and lift the testis towards the side of the incision.
Instruct the assistant to pull up on the testicle, and completely free any adhesions from behind it using your own hand; then check with your finger that there are no twists of intestine in the hard white peritoneum; if you find some, push them back into the abdominal cavity below.
Then take a needle with a thick thread, which has been twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin next to the incision; then cut off the looped ends of the thread so that there are four threads. Then you assemble them together in a rigid manner and tie the peritoneum, which we said was beneath the scrotal skin, tightly with it on two sides; then also wrap around the thread ends and bind them very tightly so that none of the vessels which nourish it can reach anything. To avoid a hot swelling occurring from that, and also to make another tie outside the first one at a distance of less than two fingers; after these two ties leave about the width of a finger's bone of peritoneum under the scrotal skin.
To avoid a hot swelling occurring from that, and also to make another tie outside the first one at a distance of less than two fingers; after these two ties leave about the width of a finger's bone of peritoneum under the scrotal skin. And cut away all the rest in a circle and remove with it the testicle, then slit below the scrotal skin as described earlier to drain blood and pus; next use oil-soaked wool placed in the wound and employ the tie that was described.
The white peritoneum, which we said should be cut carefully to avoid blood loss as this often occurs, can also be cauterized; leave the tie until it falls off by itself but if its fall is slow then moisten it with hot water and encourage sweating on it until it does so.
Then treat the wound with all the usual treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter 66.
In this wind hernia, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron; the ancients mentioned that it should be done as described for hernias associated with the groin, i.e., by tying off vessels after incision gently below.
Then make an incision in the middle and treat the swelling with something that will open it until the vessels fall out, then treat the wound as we have mentioned until it heals.
Chapter 76.
Inguinal hernia.
The inguinal hernia, as we have said, may protrude and displace the site but does not descend to the scrotum with any of the intestines; if it descends this is slight, and in all cases, it returns.
But if time goes on, the tear in the peritoneum increases until the intestines and omentum descend into the scrotum; this occurs due to the elongation of the peritoneum in the groin, as we have said. This is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes, displaces the site and causes a hernia; the treatment is cauterization as I have previously described.
It can also be treated with an iron instrument in this manner: the patient lies on their back between your hands, then you make a transverse incision at the site of the hernia, swollen and prominent, as wide as three fingers; afterwards you separate the peritoneum under the skin.
Once the white peritoneum underneath is exposed, you take a rod and place it on the prominent site of the peritoneum, pressing it into the abdominal cavity; then you suture both incisions around the middle of the rod with adhesive.
Then you remove the end of the rod, without cutting any of the peritoneum at all nor touching the testicle or anything else, as I have instructed you in the treatment of enteric prolapse; afterwards treat it with wound care.
If the sutures are broken, purify them and repair the wound until it heals; for then the peritoneum contracts and does not increase the hernia.
Cauterization is better in this place because it is closer to safety.
Chapter 86.
Regarding the relaxation of the scrotal skin.
The skin of the scrotum often relaxes in some people without the meat inside relaxing, and its appearance becomes ugly; so whoever desires to treat it should put the patient to sleep on his back.
Cut all the skin that has relaxed onto the thick skin, then bring together both lips; if you wish to first sew up the redundant relaxed skin with three or four sutures and ensure the suture is secure, then cut what is between the sutures.
Then treat it with the same treatment as other wounds until it heals, and the sutures fall out.
Chapter 69.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
For this reason, I should not have mentioned it in this book; however, I included it for two reasons: first, so that the physician may know about it if asked and be aware of its treatment; second, we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Castration can be done in two ways: either by crushing or by incision and cutting; for the method that is done by crushing, we sit the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and drop.
First crush it with your hand until it is dissolved and cannot be felt when touched, but castration by incision and cutting should be done by holding the animal and squeezing its scrotum with your left hand; then tie up the spermatic cords and make a single incision over each testicle.
Once the testicles emerge, cut them after you have removed their covering and leave nothing on them except for the thin tunica vaginalis which is over the vessels; this type of castration is better than that done by crushing.
Because crushing may leave some of the testicles, so the animal still has a desire for intercourse; then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter seventy.
Treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite can occur in two types among men; the first is that it appears below the scrotum or on the skin of the scrotum between the testicles, like a vagina with hair and urine may come from what is in the skin of the scrotum.
In women, there is one type and it is above the vagina on the pubic bone like the small penis of a man protruding outwards; one looks like a male penis while both are like testicles. The treatment for all three types is as follows:
For the two types in men and one type in women, those extra fleshy parts should be cut until their effect is removed then treat it like any other wound until it heals; as for the second type in men from which urine emerges that is in the skin of the scrotum there is nothing to do nor any hope for a cure.
Chapter seventy-one.
On excision of the clitoris and natal labia from women's vaginas.
Perhaps the clitoris has increased in size beyond what is normal, becoming prominent and unsightly. In some women, it may grow so large that it becomes like a penis, and intercourse is possible.
You should hold the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it, but be careful not to cut too deeply into its root, otherwise blood will spill.
Then you should treat it with the usual treatment for wounds until it heals, and as for the natal labia (labia that grows from the womb), this is a kind of flesh which grows in the mouth of the womb so that it fills it up.
And perhaps it emerges to the outside, like a tail. For this reason, some former authorities have called it 'caudal disease', and you should cut it as you would the clitoris, and treat it likewise until it heals.
Chapter seventy-two.
On the treatment of obstructions.
An obstruction is when a woman's vagina is not open or the opening is small, and this may be either natural (present at birth), or pathological, as a result of some later condition. The latter is caused by excessive growth of natal labia.
Or by a thin or thick membrane, either deep within the womb, on its sides, above it, or below it; this prevents intercourse, pregnancy and childbirth, and may even stop menstruation. This can be known by examination of the midwife.
If the obstruction is visible and nearby, if it isn't then investigate it with your fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is in thin peritoneum and near the labia, then quickly pierce through it by placing something resembling pads on each of the labia before putting both thumbs together.
The woman should be on her back with legs spread apart, then forcefully pull the labia until piercing through the thin peritoneum and opening up the obstruction. Take some wool, soak it in oil and place it on the affected area; have sexual intercourse with the woman every day to prevent the wound from healing over again.
If the peritoneum is thick and tough, you should make an incision with a wide lancet that resembles a bay leaf. If the obstruction is due to growing flesh, then suspend it with hooks and cut through it; have medications on hand to stop any bleeding without causing irritation such as aloe, galbanum and frankincense mixed with egg whites.
Then you should use a wide lead tube to prevent the wound from healing over quickly; hold it in place for several days using a dry linen wick, before treating with other standard wound-healing medications until it fully heals. Other types of flesh may grow inside the uterus and should be cut away in a similar fashion.
Unless it is a cancerous tumour, in which case the cancerous growth inside the uterus should never be treated with metal instruments.
Chapter 73.
On the treatment of haemorrhoids, warts and red blisters which may appear in the genital areas of women.
Haemorrhoids are caused by the swelling of the vein openings, leading to persistent and excessive bleeding. Over time, haemorrhoids may develop into warts; their various types along with identifying characteristics have been mentioned in a previous section, which we shall reiterate here...
What can be treated and what cannot, I say that hemorrhoids and warts if they are deep in the womb and do not appear to the sense of touch, then there is no treatment with iron. And those that are on the mouth of the womb and can be felt, these are the ones that can be treated.
The woman should enter a cold house, then extend the warts with a hook or a coarse cloth and cut them from their roots; then sprinkle on it, when the blood bleeds, one of the excising powders for blood without burning.
Such as acacia, styrax, frankincense and the like; then lift her legs to the wall for an hour and lower them into cold water. If the bleeding persists, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rind, gallnuts and the like; then take barley flour and knead it with honey and vinegar.
Bandage it on her back; if the blood stops, otherwise use strong cupping and press the breasts without making an incision, then take a sponge and dip it in nettle juice or asparagus juice or blackberry twig juice with gallnut infusion and apply to the affected area.
When the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for red blisters, they resemble coarse-looking entrails; you should cut away what appears of them as I mentioned for warts, and treat them until they heal.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
On the bursting of an abscess that occurs in the womb.
There are many types of tumours that can occur in the womb, such as cancer, stony tumour, ulcers, pus, suppuration, fistula, hemorrhoids, cracks, warts and hot swelling. I have already mentioned all these diseases, their types and symptoms in the classification.
We should mention, in this chapter, the hot tumour that appears in the womb, especially when it is of a kind which collects matter; how its incision with an iron instrument ought to be performed. You must examine whether the pain caused by the tumour at its outset is sharp, with pulsation, inflammation and fever.
If you see it red, and sensitive to touch, do not hasten its incision; but treat it with something that promotes ripening until these symptoms subside. Then the woman should sit on a chair with two arms and lean back.
Draw her legs toward the lower abdomen, spreading her thighs apart; place her arms under her knees and bind them with a suitable bandage.
Then the midwife should sit at her right side and use the instrument by which the mouth of the womb is opened, as will be illustrated later on; taking care to measure with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus beforehand so that the part introduced does not exceed its depth.
It would hurt the patient if the instrument exceeded that depth; then you should place pads on the lips of the cervix to prevent its introduction too deep into the uterus, and see that the screw which passes through the instrument is at its upper part.
You should hold the instrument while your assistant turns its screw until the mouth of the cervix opens; if the abscess appears and is found soft and tender when touched by hand, it must be incised at its head with a broad lancet; and when all matter has been evacuated.
Then a soft pledget should be introduced into the wound, dipped in rose oil or green ointment with some styptic properties; its end remaining outside of the incision made in the cervix. Externally to this you apply wool, pure and soaked in water that has been boiled with alum.
Then treat it with ointment suitable for this purpose after two days until it is healed.
The womb and wound may be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water boiled with the root of licorice or long-vine, and return to ointment; if the abscess is hidden deep inside the womb.
It should be treated with abstinence from iron, rather it is to be treated by what we have mentioned in the previous section.
Chapter Seventy-Five.
On instructing midwives how to treat living fetuses if they are born in an abnormal shape.
The midwife should first know the shape of a natural birth, some of its signs are: if she sees the woman move downwards and longs to breathe fresh air, and it becomes easier for her with what is on her from childbirth.
If the birth happens quickly, then know that this delivery is in a natural shape and its exit will be through the head with the placenta attached to it or hanging from its navel; if you see these signs, you should squeeze her stomach so that the fetus exits swiftly.
For if it descends head-first, the placenta will descend with it and be cleaned of all impurities; anything other than this delivery is unnatural and reprehensible because the fetus may exit feet-first or hands before its head and feet.
It may exit with one hand or foot first, or its head and a hand, or emerge folded up; it could even turn over onto its back, among other reprehensible shapes; the midwife should be skilled and gentle in dealing with all of these situations, and beware of any slip-ups or errors.
And I am illustrating each [position] and how to proceed in it, so that you may recognize them accordingly: when the infant emerges head first according to its natural course, and this is difficult for the woman and the labor pains have become hard upon her, and you see that she has lost her strength, then seat her on a chair and instruct the women to hold her steady.
Pack her womb with cooked fenugreek and moist ointments, then the midwife will insert a small scalpel between her fingers and slit the placenta open; or she may split it open with her nail until all of its fluids run out, then squeeze the woman's belly to expel the infant.
If it does not come out, then you must inject her with fenugreek saliva and sesame oil; after the injection she should roll onto her other side and be administered galbanum to induce sneezing while blocking her mouth and nose so that the infant will exit immediately; if the child's hands emerge first, they need to be gently pushed back little by little.
If they do not recede enough to allow entry, lay the woman on a raised platform with her legs elevated; then shake this platform on the ground as she holds herself steady so that she doesn't fall during the shaking; if after all of this the hands still haven't gone in and the child has died inside its mother's womb, you must amputate them before pulling out the rest.
Or you could bind its hands with a piece of cloth and gently draw them out; the infant exits feet first, when it emerges in this position, push down on its feet before slowly turning its body until properly aligned; then take one leg and stretch it out little by little.
If its legs appear as far down as the thighs, then instruct her to turn onto her other side once more and administer the galbanum again; if it does not exit despite all that we've described thus far, gently roll back the child until you get it into a natural position; at which point it should be able to slip out without incident. If none of this works...
Take some saliva from the chamomile, fenugreek saliva, sesame oil and a dissolved gum, then pound all of these ingredients together well in a mortar. Spread this over the woman's vagina and lower abdomen, then have her sit in tepid water until it reaches her breastbone.
When you see that her lower abdomen has softened, make a suppository of myrobalan for her and retain it. If the suppository holds there for an hour, then have her sit on the chair; next, sneeze her, plugging her mouth and nose while squeezing her lower abdomen gently. The fetus will come out in no time at all - coming out on its knees and hands.
If the fetus comes out in this manner, gently insert your hands gradually until it is entirely outside and then have the woman lie on her back; lower her legs downward while she is lying on a bed with her arms folded across her chest, then squeeze above her abdomen little by little. Then remove the pillows from beneath her legs so that they are suspended downwards; if the fetus doesn't come out, take hold of both her legs and move them vigorously then squeeze above her breastbone little by little until you bring the fetus up to the topmost position whereupon the midwife should insert her hand inside the uterus and arrange the fetal parts gradually.
Have the woman roll over on her side so that the fetus will come out; have it exit with its body transverse and one of its hands hanging down, proceed to draw back this hand; if you cannot pull it back then help the woman stand up and make her walk around; failing which have her lie down again.
Place her back on the bed and vigorously shake her legs, then use the poultice made of saliva that I previously described; if labour contractions begin have her sit upon a chair whereupon you should attempt to turn its hand over and restore the fetus to its natural position before having the woman sneeze while rolling onto her side so as to deliver it.
The exit of the fetus in a breech position, arms extended, and its face toward its mother's back; it is necessary that the midwife hold the baby's hand then turn him slowly and gently smooth him out. When he is ready carry before her what we have described of oil and linen cloths.
Then ask her to move a little at a time; when she does this, sit her on the chair and instruct her to lean toward her right side then have her roll over and sniff kundas (an aromatic substance); it will be expelled, the exit of the fetus upright on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the womb in this way with the placenta, split open the placenta with your nail until it empties of moisture; if it adheres to the baby's face and neck, cut it away from the navel so that he may not choke and die then push the fetus inside until you get him back where he should be.
Instruct the woman to roll over several times; it will be an easy exit, the exit of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and three or four may be born and live but this is rare indeed; as for five, that is beyond nature's scope and they cannot live at all.
And they are surrounded by a single placenta, even if there be many; they are divided by a septum membrane between them tied at the navel of each one, and may exit as does a single fetus in an easy natural way or exit badly as we have described.
If any one of them is difficult at birth and assumes unnatural shapes, treat him as we have described; let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with care and patience and devise a strategy for each shape that seems best to her regarding safety.
Mention what is conceived in the womb and falls out, it may be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or more than ten, and I have ascertained that a woman miscarried seven and another fifteen, all of them having been conceived.
By the estimation of the Almighty, All-Knowing, all this ought to be within the midwife's knowledge; for she may one day encounter such a situation and must then respond appropriately.
Chapter Seventy Six.
On delivering the dead fetus.
If you have treated the dead fetus as I mentioned in the previous chapter on treatment, and it still fails to come out, forcing you to take action with your hand, then you must assess the situation: if the woman is strong and healthy, without any symptoms that would endanger her life, she should lie down on a bed on her back.
Her head should be tilted downwards, her legs raised up, with a servant holding her on either side or she can be tied to the bed so that her body does not move when you extract the fetus.
Then the woman's womb should be moistened with oils such as mallow, fenugreek and linseed oil mixed with saliva; the midwife should grease her hands with this mixture before inserting them gently into the womb to feel for a place where she can hook in the forceps around the fetus. The appropriate places on the fetus are...
Check if the fetus is positioned to come out head first; then hook the forceps into its eyes, back of neck, mouth, jaw, chin, collarbone or close to the ribs and under the floating ribs.
If the descent is onto his feet, it should be in the pubic region and middle ribs; you must hold the hook with your right hand and bend its shank between the fingers of your left hand, then gently insert [the hook] and pierce one of those aforementioned places.
until you reach a void; then, pierce another or even third hook where needed so the pulling is equal and does not lean in any one direction; then stretch it evenly, but do not pull straight only - move [the hook] to every side.
it should be easy to get [the fetus] out, just as it is done for a molar tooth when extracting it; and between these steps the pulling must be loosened; if one side gets stuck, then the midwife should grease some fingers with oil and insert them from that side in order to rotate what was held back; once parts of the fetus come out, transfer the hooks to different spots.
it should be a little thinner, doing this until the fetus comes out; if one arm appears first and cannot be pushed back due to compression, then it must be wrapped with a cloth before being pulled so that once all of [the arm] is outside it can be cut.
either in the wrist joint or at the elbow; this is how you should proceed for the other arm and legs as well; if the fetus has a big head and encounters pressure when coming out, or water accumulates inside its skull, then you must insert between [the fingers] a pointed scalpel.
and with it you split the head so that water comes out, or you crush [the head] with an instrument called a "crusher", which appears in the figure along with other instruments in the following chapter.
You should first tear open the skull with a saw or break it up with forceps as we have said, and then extract the bones with hooks; if the head is delivered but pressed in at the clavicle, then split it until the moisture within the chest pours out.
Then the chest will close; but if it does not, and delivery is impossible, you should cut open the abdomen as best you can. If the lower belly appears swollen or there is dropsy, then an incision must be made to let out the fluid.
If the baby is in a breech position, then it can be pulled out easily and turned to face the mouth of the uterus without any trouble; but if it becomes wedged at the level of the abdomen or thorax, you must pull with a cloth that has been wrapped around your hand, splitting open the abdomen or thorax until their contents have run out.
Once you have removed all the other organs and only the head remains, it is retained; then the midwife must introduce her left hand: if the mouth of the uterus is open she should insert her hand into the cervical os, grasp the head with her fingers, and draw it towards the mouth of the uterus. Thereupon two hooks are inserted to assist in extracting it.
If the mouth of the uterus has been closed up by a hot inflammation, you must not force it open but rather use injections of warm oil and apply dressings to soften it; at this point the patient should be placed in warm water baths which relax and loosen [the tissues].
If the baby lies sideways, it should be brought into a normal position using the above-mentioned techniques for live babies; but if this is impossible, an incision must be made to remove it. You should not leave any part of the placenta behind in any event: once your treatment is complete you must use the same treatment we have mentioned for hot inflammations which develop inside the uterus.
If there is excessive bleeding, place the patient in astringent water and apply other treatments. I once observed a woman who had conceived but lost the fetus inside her, then became pregnant again with another child.
The second fetus also died, and many years later a tumor developed in her abdomen which swelled until it burst open and began to discharge pus. I was called upon to treat her, and for a long time, I tried but could not heal the wound; so then I applied some of the strong attracting ointments.
A bone emerged from the wound, and after some days another bone appeared. I was amazed by this since the abdomen is not a place for bones; so I estimated that these were the bones of the dead fetus. I examined the wound further and extracted many more bones from the head of the fetus.
I continued to extract many bones from her, and the woman remained in good health throughout this time; there was only a small amount of pus discharging from the wound. I have related this unusual occurrence here.
For it contains knowledge and assistance for the practicing physician in his treatments.
Chapter Seventy-Seven.
It contains illustrations of the instruments required for extracting fetuses.
An illustration of a spiral used to open the mouth of the womb:
This device, which is used to bind books together and has a spiral on each end of the wooden pieces, should be more delicate than that used for bookbinding. It can be made either from ebony or boxwood, with each piece being as thick as two fingers.
Curve the two pieces towards each other like a finger, and their length should be one and a half spans long. In the center of the two pieces are two guides made from the same type of wood, firmly attached to them; they should be around half a span or slightly more in length and about two fingers or slightly wider in width. These are the guides.
These are the two that are inserted into the mouth of the womb to open it with when you turn the screws, a picture of another instrument like this but more delicate and lighter:.
These are made of ebony or boxwood, shaped like tongs, but with guides at the end as you can see; each guide is about a span long and two fingers wide. When you want to open the womb with them,
Then have the woman sit on a bed with her legs hanging down, spread apart between her thighs; then insert these two guides, clasped together, into the mouth of the womb while holding the end of the instrument below between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument as you would do with tongs, equally, to the extent that you wish to open the womb. So that the midwife can do what she wants; picture of another screw mentioned by former authorities:.
Picture of the catapult which is used to propel the fetus:.
Picture of the forceps used to crush the head of the fetus:
It resembles scissors with teeth at the end, as you can see. It can be made rectangular like tongs in this picture; it has teeth like a saw which are used to cut and injure:
Another picture of a catapult:.
Figure: Hook.
This hook is slightly thicker so that it does not break when the fetus is extracted with it, figure: double-pronged hook.
Figure: two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
These instruments, the more types of them there are and the more prepared they are by the maker, will make his work faster and raise his standing in people's eyes for his ability. So do not belittle any instrument into being prepared to have it with you, as there is definitely a need for each one.

On the extraction of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold herself in, then give her bear grease and make her sneeze; press your hand over her mouth and nostrils. If this does not work, take a container...
Then make a hole in the lid and place some herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as coltsfoot, rue, dill, chamomile, wormwood, elecampane and centaury – all these medicines or some of them; cover with water and bring to boil. Then insert a silver tube into the hole in the lid at one end and the other end into the mouth of the womb.
You hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then make her sneeze as we said; the placenta will come out quickly. If it still does not come out after this treatment, instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in whale oil or saliva of sea hare.
Then insert the hand into the vagina and search for the placenta; if you find it, grasp it gently and pull it out little by little. If it is attached deep inside the womb, insert the hand as described until you reach the placenta and then extract it gently with care.
To prevent the womb from falling during strong traction, it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left. Then, the amount of traction can be increased; at that point, it will respond and free itself from adhesion. If the mouth of the womb is closed, we have described the treatment with fumigation and medications using herbs.
If it does not come out with all the methods we have described, avoid using force to re-attract it. Instead, you should tie what has emerged back to the mouth of the womb and to the woman's thigh; then inject her with the four-ingredient ointment which will rot [the womb] after a few days.
It will dissolve and come out, but if it rots, an unpleasant smell will rise to the stomach and head, harming the patient; therefore, appropriate millet should be used.
For this reason, some of the ancients experimented with millet and dried figs. Here is an illustration of the device used to fumigate a woman for retention of menstruation or afterbirth:.
It is made of lead, shaped like a funnel, or it can be made of copper; the narrow end is placed at the vulva and the wide end over fire with incense on charcoal. Hold it until that incense has burned away, then add more.

Treatment of the unruptured haemorrhoids.
Many boys are born with their anus unruptured, closed by a thin membrane. The midwife should pierce that membrane with her finger; otherwise, she should cut it with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to touch the muscle.
You then place a piece of wool soaked in wine and oil, and treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear that the anus may close up, insert a leaden tube for many days into the orifice; remove it whenever the child wishes to defecate.
The anus may also become blocked due to healing of a wound or tumor; you should cut open that healing tissue and treat it with the aforementioned treatment and lead.
Chapter Eighty.
On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower parts.
Fistulas which occur in the lower parts are a complication and thickening that happens near the anus, externally or internally on one of its sides; there may be one fistula or more.
If this complication becomes chronic and opens, moisture may drain from it in the form of a thin white fluid or pus. Some fistulas may penetrate to the rectum and intestine; those that do not will be recognized by the passage of feces and wind when the patient defecates.
Worms may exit from fistulas, and some which penetrate internally may become additional fistulas leading to the bladder or urethra; others may lead to the hip joint or sacrum. The fistula that penetrates to the anus is also identified differently than those that do not.
Insert your index finger into the anus and a slender probe of copper or iron into the fistula; if there are no bends in it, then use a slender lead probe or horsehair if it is crooked.
Until you can feel the probe or the hair in your finger, if you cannot feel it at all and nothing comes out of the hole - neither feces nor wind nor worms, as we have said - then know that it is not penetrable. Proceed with treatment promptly.
If the fistula is penetrating towards the bladder or the urethra, its indication is the discharge of urine from it and its resistance to healing with medication; however if it is penetrating towards the hip joint or coccyx, then its indicator is that the probe reaches there.
If it does not have any bone curvature, the pain is felt on one side, pus constantly discharges from it, no treatment or ointment heals it and these are all penetrating fistulas; then there can be absolutely no cure for them.
Treatment of these is useless labour for ignorant physicians who try to operate on them, but those which are not penetrating and are not chronic can be hoped to heal with iron as I am describing it below; what I have experimented upon is that the patient should lie on his back before you.
Then lift his legs and thighs up, bending them towards the belly; then insert a copper or lead probe into the fistula until you know where the end of it is located. If the patient feels it towards the buttocks, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe in your finger has penetrated by itself, uncovered without feeling any peritoneum or flesh between your finger and it; then be certain that it is penetrating. Do not labour over it as there can be no cure for it, as we have said.
They have said that it heals in some people at the wound, and among the treatments which are beneficial is to heat a thin cauterizer according to the size of the fistula as mentioned before, and insert it hot into the fistula until reaching towards the anus then return it two or three times.
So that you may know it has burnt all those extra coagulated meats which resemble a bird's quill then treat it with wet thread smeared in fat until the burned meats are expelled, and afterward treat it with emollient ointments, if it heals.
And if not, it will never heal without further treatment; but if you insert the sound and it does not penetrate to your finger that is in the anus and there exists between them a dense membrane of meat or peritoneum, and you see the fistula following the surface of the skin then make an incision at that time into the skin from the beginning of the fistula. And as you pass by the incision with the sound which is in the fistula until reaching with the incision to where the end of the sound has reached and then remove the sound, and clean those coagulated meats resembling a bird's quill leaving none behind.
Then treat it with emollient ointments until healed; but if the bleeding prevails and interferes with your work of cutting those meats, then the best course of action is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine as cautery with fire brings about two good results: burning of the extra meat...
And stopping of the blood and drying of the moistures, then treat it with wet thread smeared in fat or powdered brimstone mixed with oil until suppuration takes place at which point those burned meats will be expelled within the pus; then treat the wound afterwards with emollient ointments promoting hard flesh.
These are the medicines which have an astringent and drying effect; when the wound has healed, it is cured. The fistula should not be packed with medication, but if it has reached deep into the rectum and is far from the body's surface, then insert your finger into the rectum and explore with it.
If you feel the probe and there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh between it and the fistula, and if it is close to being healed, then act upon it with greed and hope; that is, employ one of three methods: cauterize it as we have said.
Or you may incise it until you reach its base, to ensure the insertion of catgut and treatment from close by; do not go too far with the incision lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus, causing incontinence for the patient, which can then be treated as we mentioned earlier. It is possible that he will heal, as we have said.
Or you may pierce through that barrier and puncture it after incising it close to the anus, as we have said, either with a probe or another sharp instrument; then clean out all the clotted flesh from the incision as thoroughly as possible.
Then close the entire wound, including the incision and upper orifice, so that it is sealed shut but for the fistula itself, which remains open inside the rectum; this should be less painful for the patient, although the fistula may still drain in this manner.
When you insert the probe into the fistula and it is located on one side of the rectum, towards the body's surface beneath skin and muscle, take a probe with a perforated tip like that of a cobbler's needle; it should look like this:
Insert a thread made of five threads or so, and then introduce the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom. If it is pierced through the edge of the anus from the inside, [the condition] is nearby.
Remove the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and pulling out the end of the thread; gather both ends together, pull them tight, and leave it for a day or two. Whenever the thread is cut in the flesh, tighten it well until those pieces of flesh between the ends of the threads fall off, then treat the wound so that it heals and recovers.
If the mouth of the fistula is not pierced, pierce it however you can, but do not go too deep in order to avoid cutting the muscle; then treat it as mentioned until it heals.

Chapter Eighty-One.
Regarding the treatment of bleeding hemorrhoids and cutting them, as well as treating anal fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the anus, resembling red blisters or like grapes, some small and others large; in both cases, blood flows from them constantly.
They can be singular or multiple, and they occur outside the anus and at its edges; however, those that are external are usually less moist, with a yellow liquid or slight bleeding constantly seeping from them, appearing in the color of the body.
For the treatment of warts that occur inside the anus, instruct the patient to defecate and strain themselves until the rectum is exposed and the warts are visible. Then quickly grab them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, and cut them off at their base. If the hooks do not hold because of moisture and relaxation.
Scrub it with a coarse cloth or a piece of rough wool, or pull it out with your fingers, then cut it off and sprinkle some sharp powders on it to serve as cauterization, or cauterize it as explained in the section on cauterization.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals. If the rectum does not come out, inject the patient with an injection containing a slight sting to wash out the contents of the rectum and encourage rapid expulsion when the patient strains. As for warts that are outside the anus, they are easy to deal with.
Which is that you take hold of it with your fingernail or hook it and cut it off, then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals. For those who dislike cutting with an iron instrument, you should use this method: Take a twisted thread and pass it through a needle.
Then pull the wart upwards and pass the needle through its base from the other side, wrap the ends of the thread beneath the crossed-over needle, and tie it tightly around the wart. Then knot the thread and remove the needle. Do this for all warts, leaving one unpierced.
To allow some blood to drain from it, then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or pine tar, and put it on the anus, instructing the patient to remain still. Leave it until it falls off. Once it has fallen, treat the warts with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
The treatment of fissures often occurs due to dryness and a sluggish temperament. If it becomes chronic and no medicine is effective, you should remove the dead tissue with a scalpel blade or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the top layer that prevents healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, repeat the process with more intensity than the first time, ensuring it bleeds well and then remove the skin. Treat it afterward, and it will heal.
Chapter Eighty-Two
On the treatment of inverted and non-inverted warts, dry moles, and nævi.
A wart is a round nodule, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail, and can occur anywhere on the body but especially on the soles of the feet and fingers, causing pain when walking.
You should cut around the wart, grasp it with forceps or a hook, and remove it from its root. Then treat it; if you wish, cauterize it as mentioned previously in that chapter. As for dry moles, each is a small rough dense bump protruding above the surface of the body.
They often appear on the hands of boys, and they can be treated by stretching out the mole and cutting it or piercing it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off. If you wish, cauterize it as mentioned before, either with fire or sharp medicine.
Inverted and non-inverted moles can be removed with the same tool used for treating nævi, which I will mention later. A nævus is also a small dense bump on the surface of the body that extends very deep into it; if it gets cold, you feel something like the bite of an ant.
And it occurs all over the body, but most often in the hands. To treat this, take a tube made from the feather of a goose or a strong eagle's feather and place that tube over the [affected] area until the tube surrounds it completely, then turn your hand with the tube to tear what is around the [affected] area.
and it goes deep into the flesh, uprooting the [affected] area from its base. If you wish, you may do this with a copper or iron tube in the same manner:
The top of the tube, near the [affected] area, should be solid and twisted to make it easy for the fingers to hold and twist it. If you wish, you may cauterize the [affected] area as explained in the section on cauterizing warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter 83.
On the illustration of instruments used for injection in cases of proctalgia, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, porcelain, or hollowed or hammered copper, and this instrument can be made in small and large sizes according to the user's needs. Those used for treating small boys with narrow or painful anuses should be very gentle syringes. Illustration of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, to which the bladder is attached, should be wide like this, with a barrier where the bladder is tied as you see it here. Its lower end, which enters the anus, should be solid and very smooth, with two holes on one side of its narrow part and just one hole on the other side.
The size of the hole should be equal to the thickness of the rod or slightly thicker, and the pouch that holds the medicines must be made from an animal's bladder or lambskin. It is shaped like a small cushion with a diameter of one handspan.
It is punctured with numerous holes in a circular pattern, the distance between each hole being equal to the thickness of one finger. Then you insert into these holes a tight thread made from ten or so strands of spun yarn and gather up the pouch like a cushion. Once the medicine is placed inside, tie it tightly at the head of the syringe between two stones. Then you can administer it with this device. Here is an illustration depicting the pouch and its hole.
The process of applying an enema with this device is as follows: fill the lambskin or bladder with medicine, ensuring it is warmed to a temperature that the patient can tolerate; take care not to use medication that is either very hot or very cold. Then have the patient lie on their back and raise their legs upward.
Place a board or blanket underneath them, then grease the tip of the syringe with oil, egg white, or mallow saliva; gently insert it into their anus. The assistant should take hold of the pouch in both hands and squeeze firmly until all the medication has been emptied from the syringe into the intestines.
Once the syringe has been removed, have them raise their legs towards the wall again; if the medicine causes an urge to defecate, one should try to resist as much as possible. If they sleep for the whole night, it will be all the more beneficial. Should this method be used for treating diarrhoea and the patient wishes to expedite elimination, then repeat the enema until recovery.
If there are painful hemorrhoids or tumors in the anus, let the syringe be very gentle and smooth compared to those used for injecting boys. This is a depiction of a delicate syringe with its skin stretched over it: .
Chapter 84.
In the treatment of wounds.
Wounds have been discussed in the previous section regarding their treatment by cauterization and I am now detailing their comprehensive treatment, both manual and medicinal. Wounds vary according to the instrument that caused them and also the location where they are inflicted.
The instruments that cause wounds are many, such as a stone blow or sword cut or knife incision or lance stab or stick jab or arrow and the like of numerous other implements.
And as for wounds according to the part of the body they afflict, such as a wound on the head or neck or chest or abdomen or liver and so forth with other organs.
I will now describe the treatment of some simple head wounds specifically as a guideline and rule for all other wounds, starting with those affecting the head due to their simplicity whereas compound fractures are described in book three chapter one.
If a patient presents with a simple head wound not involving bone fracture due to a stone blow or the like, having only split open the skin and forming an extensive laceration where there is concern of hot swelling developing then proceed immediately to cupping at the site. Do not delay this procedure and remove blood according to the patient's strength if there is no contraindication preventing cupping, especially if bleeding from the wound is minimal. Ensure that cupping takes place on the opposite side of the body to the injury site.
Warn the patient against over-eating, drinking, and consuming heavy foods. If there is an impediment to bloodletting, they should reduce their food intake, avoid meat and alcoholic drinks, and apply a hot cotton wool pad soaked in rose oil or astringent wine to any swelling that may occur on the wound.
If you are not worried about the hot swelling, then apply to the wound, if it is still soft and has not been changed by exposure to air, its own blood; but if the air has affected it, use some of the ointments described later.
Keep treating it until the pus comes out, and then continue treatment until it heals. If the wound is large, such as from a sword cut or similar, and its edges have not come together with rest, bring them together by suturing as described later in the section on abdominal wounds.
If the skin has been stripped back to expose bone and is only tenuously attached, cut it away then treat the wound with medications that will promote the growth of tough flesh in its place. Instruct the patient to eat strengthening foods like broth or minced meat.
If the skin becomes gangrenous and is not adhering to the bone, remove all of the affected tissue completely then treat it. If any of these wounds involve a bleeding artery or vein that will not stop with medication alone, find the pulse.
If you catch it in time, cauterize the artery with a knife and tie it off; if that does not work then cut into it until the bleeding stops. If these are minor wounds, treatment is straightforward: simply sprinkle the powder described below over them while they are still bleeding.
Before it changes due to air, the powder recipe is made of one part frankincense, two parts galbanum, and three parts hydrated or unhydrated lime; grind them all together, sift them, then fill the wound with the mixture and bind well so that it adheres properly.
It then coagulates with blood and is bound over with bandages, which are not to be removed as long as it does not become swollen; the medication will never come off until it heals. Lime on its own can also perform this function if you lack frankincense and galbanum.
This can also be done in many large wounds with cow dung, if you place it on well and bind it tightly; provided that the wounds are still fresh with blood unless they have changed due to air somewhat, especially if this occurs during summer.
If this powder is placed, there's no meaning in applying any medication; treat it as we mentioned by spreading some mature ointment or spread on it a porridge made of barley flour with water and honey to draw out the pus, then treat it with other medications until it heals.
If a bone fracture occurs with the wound, and it's minor, pull out fragments with forceps; I have mentioned treatment of skull fractures later on in neck surgery, so if this injury occurs to the neck, there is no difference in treatment compared to a simple head injury.
If a nerve is cut in the neck, there's no help for it; avoid treating it with anything that causes severe constriction such as copper sulfate or lead salts since these injure the nerve and cause spasm.
Nothing cold should be applied to the wound at all, since the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection with the brain, which is the noblest organ; what you treat it with from softening medicines such as washed slaked lime water several times moistened with oil or rosewater and tutty.
If you also wash it with fresh water and the other metallic stones in this manner, and moist salves; but if the wound is large use stitches or close its lips with swabs, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound is deep and there is a hiding place in its bottom where pus has collected, turn it in its lowest point; if an artery was severed and you perceive blood gushing from it, then sever it or bind it or cauterize it should necessity dictate so.
If the wound has severed some or all of the tracheal rings and the jugular veins have remained intact, then draw together the lips of the skin with stitches onto a tracheal rod and do not touch the trachea itself but smooth it out restore it to its natural shape before tying it tightly and leaving it for several days.
Then treat it with astringent and drying salves until healing; if the wound affects bone, then explore for any splinters of bone and remove all that you can; what cannot be done, leave until the wound becomes gangrenous, heals over and their removal is eased.
If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle upon it the powder we have described; if bone becomes gangrenous and a fistula results, then treat as shall be described under Surgery of the Chest and Region between the Shoulder Blades.
If it is a stab wound from a spear or knife and you see a deep puncture, examine it; if air escapes when the patient breathes, then know that it is a fatal wound. If there is no puncture but it is soft and full of blood, do not apply any dressings initially nor bind it tightly lest the blood becomes trapped in the wound.
It will recede towards the heart and kill the patient, but apply an attracting ointment to it and dissolve it twice a day. If you do not have any ointment, place some worn lint in the mouth of the wound to absorb any moisture that emerges from it, and let the patient sleep with the wound uncovered.
If there are no accumulations of fluid, and if more than three days have passed since the injury without any convulsions, severe palpitations or shortness of breath in the patient, and you see that all other conditions are favourable, then know that the wound is healthy; treat it with stitches and whatever other treatments are necessary until it heals.
If healing is not possible and the wound continues to discharge, then know that it has become a fistula; treat it from its outlet. Let the patient lie on the side of the wound so as to drain any accumulations of fluid there. If it is a wound in the chest or back, treat it with sutures as described previously.
If it is large, or if you have applied astringents (whether the wound is small or not), and if it has affected the bone and broken off fragments of it, then search inside the wound and proceed to extract those pieces as soon as possible if they are loose. If they are still attached, leave them until...
If the wound becomes gangrenous, it will be easier to remove them then. As for other wounds in different parts of the body, their treatment follows the rules that we have mentioned.
Chapter eighty-five.
[On surgery of the abdomen, the protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.]
The wound that occurs in the abdomen may be large, small or medium-sized. If it is large, one or several intestines may protrude from it, making their reinsertion and suturing more difficult and complex.
The small wound can also present difficulties in another respect: the intestines must be reinserted as quickly as possible, for if they are not promptly replaced and return to their original position, they swell up and become more difficult to manipulate. This is why the best kind of wound is one that is medium-sized, because it does not cause the same problems when replacing the intestines as those presented by wounds that are either too large or too small.
There are four types of sutures: two general ones, which can be used for abdominal surgery and other procedures on the body; and two others that have a more specialised use but can also be applied to most wounds except that they are particularly suited to abdominal surgery.
I shall now describe each one of these in turn to you: the first is when there is a small wound and some part of the intestine protrudes, but its replacement proves difficult; this may be due to either of two causes - either because the wound is too small as we have said before, or else because the intestine has swollen up owing to the cold air.
In such a case, you should warm the intestine by dipping a damp sponge or cloth in tepid water alone, or else in water that has been boiled with costus root, goat's rue and sweet flag; then wipe down the intestines until they have softened up.
Another method is to use a drink that has astringent properties, which is even better than water alone at softening the intestines; and once you see this process taking place, moisten them with water in which either sweet clover or breadseed poppies have been boiled - this will make their reinsertion much easier.
If it proves impossible to reverse this treatment, make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used for making fistulas; the first method is preferable if it can be done. One should only resort to incision as a last resort and when all other remedies have failed. This is an image of the instrument:
One side of it should be curved and limited, while the other is not; its thin end is not as sharp as a scalpel but rather slightly blunt, resembling a small mallet. If the wound becomes large and the intestine enters into it, one must return it to its normal position.
Its place should be specific, if you can manage it; this is preferable. But if the wound is wide and in the lower abdomen, the patient must lie on their back with their legs elevated higher than their head. If the wound is in the upper abdomen, they should have their head and chest raised above their lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always keep your focus and attention towards the side where surgery is taking place at a higher level than the other side. This method should be used for both major and minor surgeries.
For minor surgeries, you can use it as needed. Then have an assistant, who is gentle and caring, hold the wound with both hands, bringing their lips together; they should then reveal a little of it at a time to the person performing the suturing.
This is the description of a single common suture: take one needle, or several depending on the size of the wound; leave an area about as wide as your little finger at the edge of the wound and insert a single needle without any thread into both sides of the skin. With the two edges of the peritoneum under the skin from within until you pierce them from that side, and then gather together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum to make four flaps; then draw them tightly with a doubled thread around the needle several times on both sides so that the lips of the wound come firmly together.
Then leave a space as thick as the breadth of your finger also, and insert another needle; then connect it with the thread in the same way you did with the first needle, and so on until you have completed sewing up the entire wound. Let the needles be neither too thick nor too thin.
Because needles that are very thin cut through the flesh quickly, and those that are thick also find it difficult to enter the skin; therefore they should be of moderate thickness. And one must not insert the needle into the edge of the skin too close by.
Lest the flesh tear quickly and the wound open up before it has healed, nor should you sew too far apart lest the wound be prevented from healing; then cut off the ends of the needles so that they may not harm the patient when he lies down, and make for him pads out of linen rags on each side to hold the ends of the needles.
And leave the pads in place until you know that the wound has healed; and this type of suturing with needles is more suitable for small surgical wounds, as it may be sufficient to sew them up with just one or two needles or thereabouts.
Or, as to the method of suturing for more extensive wounds, you gather together in one go the four edges, that is to say, the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum with a needle having a thread of moderate thickness wound around it; then when you have passed through these four edges with the needle, bring the needle back out on the side where you started.
The thread should be passed through from above the wound, and the sutures are made like those used to sew together a sack that is tied with cords; leaving between each suture as much space as the thickness of the little finger. This kind of suture is known by everyone.
With this suture, I sewed up a surgical wound in a man's abdomen; he had been stabbed with a knife, and the length of the wound was more than one span [shibr]. About two spans of his small intestine had come out through the middle of the wound, which was located right at the center of his belly.
After having his intestines replaced back into his belly after they had been protruding outside the wound for twenty-four hours, the wound healed in around fifteen days; I treated him until he was fully cured and lived many more years, acting normally in all aspects of life. Other physicians had judged that it would be impossible for him to recover.
It is strange that I did not treat him with any ointment, because I was in a place where no medicines were available; instead, twice daily, I placed old cotton on the wound and made sure to clean it by rinsing it off with honey water until he healed.
As for one of the two types of special suturing, I will quote Galen's words verbatim: 'Begin the suture on the skin and pass the needle from outside to inside; once you have pierced through both the skin and the muscle running straight along the belly lengthwise...
...leave the peritoneum edge on the side where you inserted the needle, and pass it through its other edge from inside to outside on the opposite hypochondriac region; when you have done this, pierce that same hypochondrium edge again from outside to inside.
Leave the peritoneum edge on this side, and insert the needle into its other edge from inside to outside. As you do so, pass through the peritoneum towards the rib margin on that side until it passes completely through.
Then also start from this same side, following the edge of the peritoneum to its opposite side and bring out the needle from the nearby skin. Then return it back through that same skin, following along the rib margin on the other side with the peritoneal edge.
Bring out the needle from its nearby skin and do that again, repeating this process until you have sutured the entire wound in this manner. The general description of this stitching method is akin to that employed by furriers when sewing furs together.
Suturing the peritoneum once from one side with its edge to the skin, and leaving it from the other side each time until you are done. As for the second type of specialized suturing method mentioned by Galen, here is what he said verbatim.
It involves suturing in a manner akin to how certain healers treat wounds by bringing together each part with its corresponding natural counterpart, joining the peritoneal edge to its other side and the rib margin to its opposite side. This is carried out as I will describe to you.
You should insert the needle from outside into the nearest rib margin edge, passing it through to inside with just this one edge. Then leave the two peritoneal edges and bring back the needle, inserting it again from outside to inside through both peritoneal edges before retracting once more.
You make them pass from the inside to the outside in the other pleura, which is on the opposite side. This type of stitching is better than common and easy sutures (which were mentioned earlier). These are Galen's words verbatim. Some have said that two needles may be sufficient for abdominal stitching. This is done by inserting a single thread into both of them, and you start by entering with the needle from where you are and passing it to the other side; then insert the other needle from the opposite side, passing it to where you are according to shoemakers' stitching.
Know that a tear in the middle of the abdomen is more difficult to stitch than other abdominal areas, but as for treating wounds its treatment follows the same rules as those of other injuries; this means that when you reach the wound while it's still fresh with blood and before the air has altered it, push back the intestines and suture. Do so properly then use cauterizing agents.
If the wound has been altered by air, use any available ointments to create suppuration so that sutures can fall off and peritoneum as well as pleura fuse together. Then treat it like other wounds until recovery.
If you don't have any medication available, use old cotton since the wound begins to suppurate and change it twice a day as I told you until recovery. You usually won't need other treatments if wounds are simple; however, if you fear that nearby organs may suffer too...
You should dip a soft sponge in lukewarm oil or rosehip fat and place it around the groin area as well as armpits; if he/she feels pain or putrefaction in intestines, this often happens so inject him/her with warm black astringent.
Especially if the abscess has reached the intestine and become a perforating wound into its cavity, and know that what is of the intestines being thick heals more easily, but what is thin takes longer to heal.
And as for the small intestine, it does not accept healing from any surgery performed on it whatsoever due to the abundance and size of its veins and the thinness of its substance, which is close in nature to nerves; however, if what has protruded from the wound is omentum and you find it soft enough, return it as you would the intestine.
If it has been a while and it has turned green or black, you should tie it with thread above the spot that turned black to prevent bleeding as omentum contains veins and arteries; then cut what is below that ligature.
And leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound on the outside so that you can easily pull it out when the omentum falls and the wound becomes suppurated; recall the wound which occurs in the intestine, but if there is a small tear in the intestine.
It may be possible to repair it in some people, as I recall having seen a man who had been stabbed in the abdomen and the wound was on the right side of his stomach; the wound became chronic and turned into a fistula from which faeces and wind came out, so I treated him although I did not expect healing. I continued to treat him gently until the wound healed and the spot was rejoined; when I saw that the spot had been reunited, I feared for the patient that something bad might happen inside his body but no such misfortune befell him whatsoever and he remained in perfect health. He should eat and drink correctly, have sexual intercourse, go to the bathhouse, and exercise in his service. Some experts claim that if a small wound appears in the intestine, it should be sutured in this manner.
The method is to take large-headed ants, then bring together the lips of the wound, placing one of the ants with its mouth open on the lips of the wound. If it bites and tightens its grip, its head should be cut off; this will cause adhesion [of the wound]. Then another ant is placed near the first one.
This procedure is repeated with several ants according to the size of the wound, and then it is closed and sutured. Those heads remain sticking in the intestine until it heals completely and there is no harm whatsoever for the patient. The intestine may also be sutured with fine thread.
A thread is passed through the animal's intestine by first taking one end of this thread from the intestinal wall and passing it through [the tissue] several times, then tying a thin cotton thread to one end, after which that thread is inserted into the needle. Once the intestine is sutured with its own thread, it is returned to the abdominal cavity. This type of stitching using ants and intestines is done out of greed and hope.
But if the hole is large and wide, especially in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy and it will never heal.

Treatment of colds and sinusitis.
Any wound or swelling that becomes chronic, forming a sore which never heals and continues to discharge pus constantly is called in general terms 'sinusitis', regardless of the organ affected; we call it a cold.
It is in truth a dense, hard, white knot without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather; at times it is moist and continually discharges pus, although the moisture may cease in places. This moisture might be abundant or scarce; it can be thick or thin.
I have previously mentioned in the classification of wounds that every ulcer that does not heal and fails to grow flesh is due to one of nine causes: either a lack of blood in the body, or its poor quality; or because there is hard flesh within it and on its lips which prevents the growth of good flesh. Or because it is full of pus and dirt; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that nourishes it is of poor quality; or due to an inappropriate treatment for it; or because of a corruption in the town akin to a plague; or because of a particular characteristic of the town.
Or because it is full of pus and dirt; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that nourishes it is of poor quality; or due to an inappropriate treatment for it; or because of a corruption in the town akin to a plague; or because of a particular characteristic of the town. As was observed in the city of Saragossa, where diseases take a long time to mature and wounds heal slowly by nature; or because there is one bone or several bones involved. I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the classification.
Now, I must inform you about the treatment of fistulas and colds that can be performed manually: Fistulas can occur in all body parts; some end at large veins or arteries, while others connect to nerves.
Or they can lead to the peritoneum, intestines, bladder, ribs, vertebrae of the spine, or complex joints like those in the hand and foot; some fistulas may also end near a vital organ.
Those of these fistulas that present in this manner are among the most difficult diseases to heal and do not respond well to treatment; it is futile to attempt any therapy on them, as this will only lead to trouble and ignorance. However, if there are fistulas which have not reached the aforementioned places, then one may hope for their successful treatment.
If you wish to ascertain this, take a probe made of copper or iron; if the fistula passes in a straight line, then use it for examination. But if there is any deviation in the course of the fistula, examine it with a thin lead probe, as lead will conform to its shape.
It will smoothly enter and bend towards the deviation; if the fistula has multiple mouths that cannot be identified with a probe, inject one of its openings—the fluid you inject will travel to the other openings and flow out.
Then proceed with a thorough examination in any way possible to determine if there is bone, nerve or if the bottom of the fistula is deep or shallow; whether it has multiple openings from one fistula; and establish all these facts by questioning the patient about his condition and noting where pain occurs when you apply pressure.
Consider all these signs and symptoms that occur with the swelling, and once you have a clear understanding of them, proceed to treatment with confidence: First, examine if it is...
If the fistula is superficial and close to the surface or in a healthy area away from joints, nerves, arteries, veins, or any of the aforementioned places, then proceed with cutting open the fistula as previously described and remove all the hardened material, decayed flesh, and excess tissue.
Any flesh or wart that grows in the fistula, and its treatment until it heals; if the fistula is deep-seated and straight, then you should open it up as deeply as possible, and then clean out all the unhealthy flesh.
Then use the twisted thread in sharp medicines and insert it to the bottom of the fistula that you can reach with an iron instrument; do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine eats away all the remaining unhealthy matter at the base of the fistula.
Then apply salves that promote healthy flesh growth until it heals; if it does not heal in this way, then cauterize it as described before. If the cause of the fistula is bone and you are sure about it, then probe for it and open up the fistula as I have told you, unless something prevents you from doing so.
If it is a vein, nerve or main organ as we have said, and the bone is exposed with some corruption and discolouration, then clean away this matter until all corruption has gone; then treat it with something that will make it heal. If it does not heal and the pus continues to flow as before.
Know that you have not completely removed all the corruption, so uncover it again and thoroughly seek out any remaining matter; clean away and purify this as best you can, then apply something to promote healing. If it heals, well and good, but if not, know that the unhealthy matter lies deep within, so uncover everything around it once more.
Seek out any remaining matter, and clean away and purify it as best you can; if the unhealthy bone is small and you are able to remove it, then do so with fine forceps suitable for this purpose.
If there are many bones, try to extract them all and leave none behind as best you can. If anything from the ligaments obstructs this process, and cutting these is not hazardous, then cut those ligaments and any flesh that may be present, so as to free the bones.
If you are unable to extract the bones at this time, apply something that will cause gangrene to the wound and leave it for several days until the flesh and ligaments around the bones have become gangrenous. Ensure that the wound does not heal so as to preserve the incision made during your work.
Alternatively, if you are concerned about this, place on it a piece of cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil or a piece of cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or one of the green ointments. Once those ligaments have become gangrenous and the bones have decayed, extracting them will be easier.
If it is a single large bone, such as the shin or thigh bone, and only its surface has been damaged, then strip away this damage thoroughly until all blackness and corruption are removed; then set the wound. But if a large part of the bone has become corrupted, and the corruption has reached into the marrow, then it must be sawn through.
Remove the entire affected part until you reach sound bone; then treat it so that it may heal. I will tell you of a case of osteomyelitis which presented in a young man's leg, so as to provide an example and aid your understanding: "This man...
Around the age of thirty, this man was afflicted with pain in his leg, caused by an internal infection which spread to the bone and resulted in a large swelling; there were no external causes identified. Over time, with mismanagement from physicians, it progressed until the swelling opened.
Many substances were applied to it and the treatment was mishandled until the leg began to stink, and many openings developed in it from which pus and bodily fluids oozed forth. The patient underwent treatment by several physicians for about two years but among them there wasn't one who had mastered the practice of surgery.
Until he came to me, and I saw his leg with the substances oozing from those openings in great quantity, and the man had become emaciated and yellow-colored. So I inserted the sound into one of those openings and it reached all the way to bone; then I examined all of them.
Finding that they led into one another from all sides of the leg, I boldly made an incision over one of those openings to expose some bone and found it had gone bad: eaten away, blackened, putrefied, and perforated until reaching the marrow, so I excised what was exposed.
I laid hold of the damaged bone, thinking there was no other damage in it besides what I had cut away and excised; then I kept dressing the wound with healing medications for a long time but it still didn't heal up; so I once again removed the dressings to inspect the bone beyond my previous examination.
There I found more damage in the bone, so I excised what was exposed to me of that damage as well; then I attempted to heal it but it still wouldn't heal or close up. So once again I removed the dressings and didn't stop cutting away part by part from the bone (about a span's length) and trying to heal it until it finally did heal.
I removed it with its marrow and dressed it with medications, so it quickly healed over and he recovered; this repetition in the procedure and incision was necessary given his weak condition and low tolerance as well as my concern that he might die since at all times due to excessive evacuations he would suffer from a bad swoon. He made a full recovery.
If firm flesh grew in the place of a bone, its condition improved within the body, its strength returned and it resumed normal functioning; and if there is no impediment to walking that might be harmful, then it was a bone which had protruded at some site on the body and broken.
You should dress it in this manner: take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone, then have someone pull it upwards while you bind another bandage made from thicker woollen cloth on top of the first.
Then bind it to the flesh below the bone, pulling its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards; meanwhile you expose the area for sawing lest the flesh be damaged by the saw. Place a piece of wood or board underneath the bone on the lower side, securing it firmly.
Because if you do this, the saw will not be hindered from cutting through the damaged bone; and it should be cut slightly above where the damage is to avoid having any corruption within the cavity of the bone that may not appear on its surface, necessitating another cut.
If the bone is damaged and not protruding, but rather its parts are connected to one another, with damage in its middle or a portion of it; then expose all sides of the flesh before placing the piece of wood underneath and sawing from the side where there is corruption.
Once you have finished sawing it, then saw it from the other side; and let this cutting also be slightly removed from the damage as previously stated. If corruption is at a joint, cut through that damaged joint itself before sawing into bone where it connects on the opposite side.
If the damage affects where two joints are connected, then there is no alternative but to scrape it clean; if corruption occurs at either of the carpal bones in hand or foot, treating it will be extremely difficult—nevertheless you should peel away any affected tissue and thoroughly clean it as best you can.
By which trick will it be straight for you when no vein or nerve obstructs you, and know that the chisels and saws to cut these bones are many according to their position, direction, thickness, thinness, largeness, smallness, hardness, and porosity. Therefore it is necessary to prepare for each type of work an instrument that suits that work.
Know that the works themselves may indicate to you the type of instrument you need if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this craft, for he who is skilled in the craft and has witnessed various diseases. Thus, he may devise for himself instruments suited to each disease, and I am showing you at the end of this chapter a collection of such instruments.
They will serve as examples to be followed and as analogies by which you may judge others, if God wills it; an illustration of a saw:

Chapter 87.
On amputating limbs and sawing bones.
If a limb becomes gangrenous, whether due to external or internal causes, and if treating it with medication proves ineffective, and you observe the corruption spreading through the tissue, unchecked by any means.
In such cases, it is necessary to amputate the affected limb up to and including the corrupted tissue, to save the patient from death or great harm, which would be worse than losing the limb. A sign of this situation is that the limb turns black, as if burned by fire.
Or it may decay after turning black, with the corruption spreading to surrounding tissue and throughout the body. In such cases, prompt amputation is necessary. This applies similarly when gangrene results from stings or bites of certain creatures like sea scorpions, snakes, or tarantulas.
If the decay or sting is in the tip of the finger, amputate the finger without delay, lest the decay spread to the hand. Similarly, if it has taken hold in the hand, cut it off at the elbow joint, and do not allow the decay to progress further up the arm.
And if it has affected the arm, amputate at the elbow joint, at the very hinge. But if the decay progresses further towards the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder at all, for this would lead to the patient's death. Instead, employ other treatments as best you can.
Do the same with the leg if decay sets in at the toe: amputate the toe at one of the joints. If it affects the metatarsus, cut off the entire foot. But should it spread to the knee, sever the leg at the knee joint.
If decay has spread above the knee, there is nothing to be done but to leave it and let the patient die. As for the procedure of amputation or excision: tie a ligature below the part you wish to cut, and another one above.
The attendant tightens the lower ligature, while another draws up the upper one. You then strip away the flesh between the two ligatures with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is exposed; then you cut or excise it. You should place pieces of linen cloth on all sides.
This is to ensure that the saw does not touch the correct spot, causing additional pain and hot swelling for the patient. If there is any bleeding during the procedure, cauterize the site quickly or apply some blood-clotting agents; then return to your treatment until you are finished.
First, bind the wounded limb with an appropriate bandage and treat it until it heals. I will tell you of a case that presented itself to a man in his leg with this very problem I describe to you; a blackening with burning akin to fire occurred on his leg.
This corruption first began in his toe, spreading to encompass the entire leg. The man took it upon himself to amputate at the joint when he saw that the disease was progressing with severe pain and burning; afterward, he healed.
After a long period, the same corruption presented itself in the index finger of his hand, so he came to me. I treated it with medicines applied to the hand after cleaning the affected area, but the disease did not cease and continued to spread to the other fingers.
Until the disease spread to his hand, he asked me to amputate it, but I refused due to my desire to treat him and stop the corruption as well as fearing that, with his weakened state, amputation might kill him. When he despaired of treatment from me, he returned home.
I heard that he amputated his entire hand and healed, so I shared this story as an example for similar cases of this disease; it may serve as a guide to be referenced and acted upon.
Chapter 88.
The treatment of abscesses and how to inject them with medicines.
If a tumor occurs in some fleshy organ and its duration is prolonged until it has matured, then bursts or suppurates, expelling all of the pus within so that the site remains empty like a cavity.
The skin over it is like a rag, having become thin and not being so corrupt as to affect the bone or the nerve or the ligament; hence it deserves to be called a hiding-place, and should not be named 'fistula' unless corruption persists until affecting some of these parts.
Then it is called 'fistula' or 'rhinitis', and its treatment consists in cutting away all that rag-like skin as one turns, especially if it has become thin and fragile; one must also make sure that the wound heals without adhesions due to corruption.
If you wish the skin to adhere, provided that corruption has not yet reached that extent and there is still some flesh remaining in the skin, then treat it with a syringe: look at the fistula; if large, and its pus foul-smelling, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey and verdigris, equal parts mixed together in a bowl and boiled until the mixture has the consistency of honey; then take what you need from it, dilute with water and honey to inject into the fistula; tighten the wound and leave medicine for two hours.
Then remove it by pressing; do this for several days until the fistula is cleansed and odour removed; alternatively, inject with lye water if you lack that medicine: take grapevine wood ash or oakwood ash mixed with water.
Strain it and inject until you are sure that the fistula is clean; should the patient not be able to tolerate Egyptian medicine or lye water, then use a mixture of water, honey, and some powdered verdigris.
Or treat it with a mixture of honey and wine because honey cleanses and washes, and wine helps to bind the hidden [abscess], especially if the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness. So when you have done this several times and are certain that its corruption is gone, then inject into it something that promotes flesh growth.
For example, you can take some balsam ointment and dissolve it in rose oil and astringent wine or inject into it some of the other medicines and salves whose properties we have described in our article on salves; if the mouth of the abscess is narrow and does not accommodate the syringe.
Then widen it a little with an iron instrument or place in it a wick moistened with Egyptian ointment or Serapion's salve so that it widens; and if the mouth is also wide, then draw its lips together by means of sutures, leaving enough space for the syringe to enter without excess.
In the same way, if the mouth from which pus is discharging rises upwards, then split it in its lowest place so that pus flows downwards; for when pus becomes trapped within a deep abscess it prevents flesh growth there.
If you are unable to split the abscess towards its bottom as desired, then lift up the limb so that pus flows out easily according to your arrangement and ensure that none of it remains trapped within at all.
As for the healing medicines which are applied externally to an abscess and how they should be used, one takes one of the healing salves suited to the desired purpose and spreads it over a piece of linen cloth; let the size of the cloth be such that it covers the entire abscess. First, use the scissors to cut in front of the cavity's mouth, making an opening slightly wider than the cavity's mouth. Then, spread some soft ointments on another piece of cloth that is the same size as the hole and place it over the wound, positioning it a little away from the cavity's mouth so that pus can easily drain out. Do not remove the large cloth unless after...
Several days, but the one over the cavity's mouth should be removed at all times to drain out any pus that has accumulated and to check if there is a lot or little of it and whether it is ripe or unripe.
And, in addition to that, also check the location of the cavity itself; ask the patient if they feel any pain or not and if there is a swelling or no swelling. If you continue treatment like this and see that very little material comes out from the mouth of the cavity...
Then, you should know that the cavity has either healed or is almost healed; so, remove the bandages after one day or on the third day. Whenever you redress the wound, replace the cloth with a new one and apply fresh ointment. If, after some time, thin pus still comes out from the cavity, do not lose hope about it healing completely.
Healing will be quick because some people's wounds heal slowly, while others heal faster; if, after several days, pus that is not yet ripe comes out of the cavity, know that it has not healed completely. If healing takes a long time...
If the process takes a long time, increase the use of drying medications and choose ones that are moist in consistency but dry in strength, such as palm ointment if additional calamine has been added to it. One very effective treatment is to take palm ointment...
It is treated with rose oil and sprinkled with moderate old wine, then kneaded into it and used. Alternatively, a similar action can be taken if the palm honey ointment is not available: boil the honey until thickened and use it, or take myrrh, aloe vera, and costus; grind them all together and sprinkle over honey while still on the fire. Then apply it to a cloth and bind it over the wound, or cover [the wound] with honey that you have boiled until thickened; sprinkle drugs over it, place cloths on top, and bind them.
Or [you] may use for such purposes long asarum, the root of purple iris, karsina flour, and inula, either alone or combined; grind them together, sift, and sprinkle over the honey I have described, then use it. If this treatment goes on too long without curing the wound, know that there is some corruption within [the wound].
If it affects the bones, or any of the other hard nerves or ligaments, treat them with the same treatment as for a fistula.
Chapter 89.
Treatment of dacryocystitis, ingrown nails, amputation of superfluous digits, and separation of fused fingers.
Dacryocystitis is a large piece of flesh that grows beneath the thumbnail or big toe, and it may also grow on other fingers. If this condition goes untreated for too long, it swells up with hot inflammation.
Or it may become gangrenous, eat into the nail bed and possibly destroy all of it; perhaps spreading as far as the bone where it emits a foul stench with the tip of the finger becoming swollen and turning blue-black. If you treat this condition using any of the methods described previously but they do not work...
The iron should be used to cut away any excess growth from the nail, and then the wound should be cauterized afterward. Cauterization is extremely beneficial in such cases; however, if the bone remains intact while the nail is also sound.
If the nail corner has pushed flesh inward, causing it to be prodded and harmed, a thin ointment should be applied beneath the corner of the nail that is doing the harm, lifting it upwards and cutting away that flesh gently.
You should apply caustic medicines to the remaining flesh until it is all removed, then treat it with salves until it heals. However, if corruption has affected the bone, you must cut and remove that bone as it will never heal so long as rotten bone remains.
If you observe necrosis and corruption spreading into the finger, amputate it at one of the joints as previously mentioned, then treat it until healed. Should a severe pain occur in the nail due to an injury or blow, you must first perform bloodletting on the patient.
Next, use a sharp lancet to make an oblique incision in the nail from top to bottom; be cautious not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail as this will cause the patient great pain and result in excess flesh growth at that spot. Treat the area with medicines for pain relief.
An extra finger that grows on some people's hands may be entirely fleshy, or it may have bones and even a nail; the growth of these extra digits is sometimes at the base of another finger's joint.
Alternatively, the extra growth may occur on one of an existing finger's joints; those that grow there cannot move. If movement is detected then cutting it off will be more challenging as it likely has bones and a nail. To remove the fleshy ones, simply cut them away at their base using a broad lancet.
As for those [nuclei] that grow in the base of a joint, their treatment is difficult and one should avoid cutting them. But as for those that appear on a finger close to one of the phalanges, it is necessary to first cut away all the flesh around them in a circular motion until you reach the bone; then use an appropriate saw to split open the bone.
Once it is treated, allow the wound to heal. Regarding syndactyly of fingers - which often occurs and can be congenital or due to improper healing after an injury or burn - one should separate them by cutting through the joined tissue.
Keep the separated fingers apart with a woolen thread or cloth soaked in rose oil to prevent them from joining quickly, or place a thin sheet of lead between them until they heal properly.
In the case of syndactyly between a finger and the palm, separate them according to what is feasible and appropriate for maintaining the form of the limb.
Chapter 90.
On the excision of varicose veins.
Varicose veins are twisted, thick blood vessels filled with black bile that can occur in many parts of the body but most commonly affect the legs, especially in those who frequently carry heavy loads or engage in activities like climbing fig trees and harvesting carrots. To begin treatment, one should vigorously apply a purge to eliminate black bile from the body multiple times.
After applying the purge, the patient should have their basilic vein opened to allow blood to flow out. Iron treatment for varicose veins can be divided into two types: one where an incision is made to release black blood and another where the entire affected vein is removed. To perform the latter, first thoroughly wash the leg with hot water.
Until the thick, cloudy blood is dissolved, then the sick person's leg should be bound from above their thigh down to below their knee with a bandage, and then the vein should be cut open in one place or two places or three, making an extensive incision.
Then let the black blood flow out with your hand from below the calf upwards and from above downwards, until you remove as much blood as you deem sufficient or as much as the patient can bear; then bind it up and instruct them to avoid foods that produce black bile; afterwards, repeat the process of evacuating and bleeding.
When the veins are full and it becomes harmful for the patient, then as regards letting out blood, this is how it should be done: Shave the leg of the patient if there is a lot of hair on it; then take them to the bathhouse and bathe their leg with hot water until it turns red and begins to sweat profusely or they engage in rigorous exercise.
If no bathhouse is available to heat the limb, then you should cut open the skin opposite the vein with a longitudinal incision either at the end by the knee or below at the heel; then use hooks to separate the skin and expose the vein on all sides until it can be felt.
Once it appears, you will see that it is bright red; and when it is freed from the skin, you will also see that it resembles a tendon; then insert a probe underneath until it lifts up and emerges from the skin, attach it to a smooth blind hook, and make another incision nearby about three fingers' width away.
Then strip the skin from over the vein until it is exposed, lift it with a probe as you did before and attach it to another hook in the same way; then make another incision or several incisions if necessary.
Then extract it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel. Then pull it out and extract it until it comes out from the second incision. Pull it towards the incision above, and repeat this process until you draw it through the third highest incision of all incisions. Once it is fully extracted, cut it.
If it does not respond to pulling and extraction, insert a needle with a strong doubled thread and tie it. Pull it out, then insert the cylindrical rod underneath and twist your hand in both directions until it comes out. Be careful that it doesn't break; if it breaks, extracting it will be very difficult.
This would be harmful for the patient, so once you have extracted it all, place some wool soaked in rose vinegar or oil on top of the surgical wounds and treat them until they heal. If the tendon is stiff with wrinkles and twists towards multiple directions...
And if it is not straight, as we mentioned earlier, you should make incisions on each side of its wrinkles and bends before hanging it with hooks to extract the whole thing. Be careful when making incisions that you do not cut or injure any blood vessels because this would make extraction very difficult; take every precaution.
Image of the needle used for incising tendons:
Image of the blind hook:
Unlike regular hooks, this hook should not have a barb and its end should not be sharp to avoid injuring blood vessels. It must also be thick with a smooth bend as opposed to being thin because it might cut the blood vessel if that were the case.
Chapter ninety-one.
In the abscess of the civic vein.
This vein is formed in the legs in hot countries such as Hijaz, Arabia and other hot, barren lands with little fertility. It may also form elsewhere on the body apart from the legs; its formation results from putrefaction occurring under the skin.
As happens inside living bodies, and in worms, pumpkins and maggots formed between skin and flesh, a sign of the beginning of this vein's formation is that severe inflammation occurs in the leg then the site becomes blistered before the vein begins to emerge from the blistering site.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal, once its tip appears you must wrap it around a small piece of lead weighing between one and two dirhams, then tie it in place before leaving the lead suspended from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it, wrap and tie it in the lead; if it becomes very long then cut a piece off and wrap the rest without cutting it at its root before all has emerged because if you do cut it there, it will retract into the flesh causing a tumour and putrefaction at that site alongside an ulcer.
It is for this reason that it must be handled carefully and drawn out gradually until the entire length has emerged, leaving nothing behind in the body; some people may find that their vein reaches five or ten hands in length.
I have heard that in one man's case, it was twenty hands long; if yours breaks while being treated then insert a probe into the hole and push it deep within the body to empty all matter from inside before attempting to putrefy the site with medicines over several days.
First, treat it with the treatment for tumors; this vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in the ankle or leg itself and forms numerous mouths, from each of which emerges a branch. Treat it as we mentioned previously using the classification methods described above.
Chapter 92.
In the incision for the worms that form underneath the skin, known as cow disease.
This disease is known in some of our countries as cow disease because it often affects cows; it is a small worm that forms between the skin and flesh, moving throughout the body up and down.
It can be felt as it moves from one organ to another, until it pierces the skin at a certain spot and exits; forming due to the putrefaction of some humors just like what happens with worms and snakes or in cases of abdominal abscesses.
The anticipated harm from this worm is that when it moves through the body, reaches the head and enters the eye, it may open the eye to exit, thereby blinding the patient; this occurs frequently. So, if you wish to treat and extract it, do so while it is moving and felt.
You should tightly bind the areas above and below it with a bandage, then make an incision on it to extract it. If it sinks into the flesh and you cannot find it, cauterize the area with fire until you burn it; this worm can severely harm the eye as we mentioned before.
If you see that it has reached the head near the eye, bind tightly underneath on the forehead and make an incision to extract it. The patient should regularly purify their body using medications that facilitate the removal of putrid humors, while avoiding foods that cause such putrefaction.
Chapter ninety-three.
Incision for treating the condition known as "elephantiasis".
This condition, which is called "elephantiasis" in our country, is a pain that manifests in certain body parts and then moves from one part to another; I have seen cases as I describe them to you.
I was called to treat a sick woman in the countryside; she exposed her arm, showing me some slight swelling on the radial artery. After about an hour, I noticed this swelling creeping up along her forearm, just like a worm moving towards her shoulder as fast as quicksilver.
If the swelling moves from one place to another, and the pain vanishes from that spot but settles on her shoulder; after some time passes it spreads all over her body until it reaches her other arm too; then she told me how it travels throughout her entire body as I witnessed.
I was amazed by how quickly it moves from one part to the other; I had never seen this condition with my own eyes like this before, although I have treated patients who complained of pain moving through their bodies; but I had not witnessed it personally as I did with this woman.
I can only explain this by the fact that she was a woman from the countryside, with dry skin and exposed veins; so this wind-like movement of pain could be felt and seen by touch in her case; but it would not appear like this in people who are well off, have moist skin and hidden veins.
When you treat this condition and the patient feels the pain, if it appears to your eyes as we described, then bind over it and under it quickly; make an incision in that spot so that the trapped wind comes out; cauterize the place afterwards.
So if you cannot see it with your eyes, treat it by shaking the body and using what dispels flatulence and relieves it, such as stinking nettle (Acnida) seed and scabiosa [scabious] seed and other similar medicines.
Chapter 94.
On removing arrows.
Arrows may differ according to their types and the parts of the body in which they are embedded; as for the difference between them due to their type, some are large, others small. Some have three or four sides, while others are hollow glass arrows and solid glass ones.
Some have barbs, while others splinter into fragments. As for those that differ according to the parts of the body in which they are embedded, these can be divided into two types: either the part is a major hollow organ such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines or bladder, etc. So, whenever an arrow strikes one of these organs and you observe the signs of death which I will describe to you later on, it is imperative that you avoid removing this arrow, as in most cases death shall inevitably follow. And if these dire signs do not manifest and the arrow has not sunk deep into the organ, remove it and treat the wound; among the signs of an arrow striking the brain is that after piercing through the bone and lacerating the dura mater covering the brain, there will follow intense headaches, vertigo and dizziness.
And if these dire signs do not manifest and the arrow has not sunk deep into the organ, remove it and treat the wound; among the signs of an arrow striking the brain is that after piercing through the bone and lacerating the dura mater covering the brain, there will follow intense headaches, vertigo and dizziness. Redness of the eyes and tongue, convulsions, delirium, vomiting bile, blood may flow from the nostrils or ears; perhaps speech is lost along with the voice and a moist white discharge resembling porridge may ooze out of the wound site while a liquid akin to the juice of flesh flows forth.
If these signs appear, cease treatment and refrain from extracting the arrow if it has not yet been removed. As for the signs of an arrow that has penetrated near the left breast and the heart, one may feel as though it is lodged in something solid rather than empty space.
Perhaps the arrow has a pulsating movement, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by cold sweat and shivering of the limbs, and a sense of faintness; know that death is imminent. A sign that the arrow has pierced the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels in the neck may swell, and the patient's complexion changes; they breathe heavily and crave cold air to inhale. If the arrow has penetrated the diaphragm within the chest, it is likely close to the smaller ribs, causing labored breathing accompanied by severe pain.
The patient may sigh and experience movement in all the muscles of the shoulders. If the arrow has pierced the liver, it is followed by severe pain, and blood resembling the redness of the liver may flow from the wound. Should the arrow strike the stomach, undigested food might be discharged through the injury.
The situation is apparent if the arrow has struck the abdomen and become embedded, discharging feces from the wound or causing the omentum or intestines to rupture; in such cases, there is little hope for treatment or arrow extraction. Should the arrow penetrate the bladder, leading to urinary discharge...
If something protrudes externally from the bladder, and the patient experiences intense pain, know that their fate is sealed. As for other body parts like the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, or similar organs—they might be spared in most cases.
When an arrow does not pierce a vein or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned, I shall inform you about some cases I have witnessed regarding these arrows so that you may draw upon this knowledge for your treatment. An example is when an arrow struck a man in the corner of his eye at the root of his nose.
So I removed it for him from the other side, below the earlobe, and he healed without any harm coming to his eye. I extracted another arrow that had struck a Jew in the fatty tissue of their eye beneath the lower eyelid; the arrowhead was deeply embedded, but I could only grasp its small tip that is attached to the wooden shaft.
It was a large arrow, one of the composite bow arrows with a square, smooth iron head that lacked ears. The Jew healed without any harm to their eye. I extracted another arrow from a Christian's throat; it was an Arabian arrow.
This one had ears; I made an incision between the jugular veins and extracted it as it was deeply embedded in his throat. With careful treatment, I managed to remove it, and the Christian survived and healed. I extracted another arrow from a man who had been struck in the belly; we thought he would die from it.
After thirty days or so had passed without any change in his condition, I made an incision near the arrow and managed to remove it; he healed without further incident. I saw a man who had been struck by an arrow in the back, and the wound had healed over it.
Then, after seven years had passed, the arrow emerged from the root of his thigh. I saw a woman who had been struck in the belly by an arrow; the wound healed over it, and the arrow remained inside her without causing any change in her condition or hindering her natural functions.
I observed another man with an arrow embedded in his face, the wound had healed but he experienced little pain. There are many such cases. I removed an arrow for one of the Sultan's commanders which had struck him in the middle of his nose and slightly deviated to the right side.
The arrow was completely embedded, so I was called to treat him three days after being struck by the arrow. I found that the wound caused by the arrow was very narrow. I probed it with a fine sound but could not feel it and he experienced pain and pricking below his right ear.
Hoping that the pricking sensation was caused by the tip of the arrow, I bandaged the area with a strong drawing plaster and applied warmth hoping the site would swell and reveal the arrow's presence so I could cut it open, but this did not happen and there were no signs to indicate the arrow had reached that spot.
I continued with the bandage for many days but there was still no change so the wound closed over and the patient despaired of removing it until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and informed me, so I applied a strong corrosive ointment to the wound for many days.
I kept applying the corrosive until the wound opened up and I probed it, feeling the thin tip of the arrow attached to the shaft. Then I further widened the wound with that caustic drug over a period of time lasting about four months.
When the wound was wide enough for me to insert my forceps, I grasped and tried to move it but it would not budge so I kept trying different techniques with various instruments until one day I managed to grasp it firmly with a strong set of forceps as illustrated at the end of this chapter.
And the physicians thought that the cartilage of his nose could not be set, so I reset it and the wound healed and the patient recovered completely without any problems whatsoever, and I will inform you about how to extract some arrows so that you can make this a measure or an indicator for what has not been mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description nor can they be covered in a book, rather the skilled craftsman measures the little against the much and what is present against what is absent, deducing new work and tools when faced with strange circumstances.
So if you descend into this craft, I would say that arrows can be extracted from the members in which they are embedded in two types: either by pulling them out of where they entered or on the other side from where they entered.
Either the arrow should be protruding from a fleshy spot, in which case it is pulled and extracted, but if you are not able to pull it out at first then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it rots making it easier to pull out and extract; likewise, if it is embedded into bone.
If it still does not come out, then leave it for a few more days and try to pull it every day; if after some days it still won't come out, you should drill around the arrow into the same bone from each side with a delicate drill until there is space made wider for the arrow before pulling it back.
If the arrow is embedded in a bone of the head and it has penetrated deep into one of the ventricles of the brain, so that some symptoms manifest themselves as I have previously mentioned to you, then desist from trying to pull out the arrow and leave it until after several days when its state becomes clear.
Proceed with extracting the arrow, and if it is deeply embedded and does not yield to your pulling force, use the drills around the arrow as I have described before. Then treat the wound until it heals. However, if the arrow has disappeared into a body cavity... If it is no longer visible to the eye, probe for its location with a sound or a probe; once you locate it, extract it using suitable instruments if possible. If this proves impossible due to the wound's narrowness or the arrow's deep penetration, and there are no bones, nerves, or arteries in the way...
Then cut the flesh to widen the wound and extract the arrow, gripping it with a suitable instrument; if there are ears [on the arrow], grasp them firmly and separate any tissue caught in them from all sides using every possible means. If you cannot free the flesh, break or twist off the ears instead.
While attempting to extract the arrow, whichever body part it is in, use a pair of pliers to rotate your hand in all directions and free [the arrow]. Be as gentle as possible so that you do not break the arrow shaft when pulling, which would make its removal more difficult. If you still cannot extract it after some time...
Leave it alone for several days until the surrounding flesh begins to putrefy, then try again; this should make its removal easier. If you encounter bleeding during your efforts, treat it as mentioned in the relevant section of this text. Be very careful not to cut an artery, nerve, or tendon and use every possible trick.
Extract every arrow in any possible way, gently and carefully as I described to you. You should ensure that the patient is placed in the same position they were when the arrow struck them; this is most effective.
If that is not possible, use whatever means are available to you. As for an arrow which exits from the opposite side, either a part of it may protrude outside or you may find the tip of the arrow by touch under the skin nearby and see it protruding.
In that case, make an incision and let it be of a size large enough for the extraction hooks. Then extract [the arrow] as it will become easier to remove. If it becomes entangled in bone, then twist your hand around until the arrow affects the bone and makes room for itself, and then pull it out.
If not, then leave it for a few days and return to it until [the arrow] is removed. If the shaft of the arrow is still inside, push it out with that same shaft; but if the shaft has fallen off and you wish to use force, insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity encloses the end of the arrow's barb, then push [the arrow] out with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that fits inside its cavity; this will make [the arrow] easier to remove. If the arrow is poisoned, you should excavate all the flesh which has been affected by poison, if possible, then treat it with whatever remedy is appropriate.
If the arrow which has struck is in the chest, or abdomen, or bladder, or ribcage, and it is close enough to be felt with a probe, then make an incision provided you can do so without severing any arteries or nerves; extract [the arrow].
Then suture the wound if it requires stitching, then treat it until it heals. Image of forceps used to extract arrows:.
Their ends are shaped like a bird's beak, and they are made like a file; when it grips the arrow or any other thing, it does not let go. They can be made in various sizes: large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow and the extent of the wound.
Image of the hollow cannon:
Image of the solid cannon:
This one is solid at the tip, like a rod, to facilitate its entry into the hollow arrow and push it.
Chapter 95.
In bloodletting from the veins.
There are thirty veins which custom has prescribed for bloodletting in the body; sixteen of them are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as al-hisasan, and the two arteries on either side of the temples (al-qudd), visible at the surface, along with the two veins located at the canthus of each eye, known as an-naẓiran.
And the vein on the midline of the forehead, and the vein at the tip of the nose; also the two jugulars in the neck and the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, as well as those in the lower lip – these last are known as jaharak. Lastly, there are the two veins under the tongue.
The veins which are bloodlet from the arm and hand number five: first, kafal, on the lateral side, known as 'vein of the head' by laypeople; second, akhal, in the middle region, made up of a branch of basilic plus another branch from kafal, this being called 'vein of the body' by the public.
The basliq is the vein placed on the medial side; it is also called the axillary vein. The common people call it the abdominal vein, or the arm cord. It is attached to the ulna and lies against it. It can be clearly seen above the thumb, as well as aseilam.
This is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, which has two branches. In the leg there are three veins: one under the popliteal fossa on the lateral side; the second is the safena, located at the heel on the medial side; and the nerve vein, located at the calcaneus on the lateral side.
In the other leg there are three similar veins. As for the two veins behind the ears, their ligation is beneficial for chronic colds, migraines, tinea capitis, and chronic head ulcers; I shall describe how to perform this procedure.
The procedure is as follows: shave the patient's head and scrub their nape in the area of the two veins with a coarse cloth, scrubbing thoroughly. Then have the patient strangle his own neck with a turban until the veins behind both ears become visible; they are located at the lowest points on the sides of the head. Feel for them with your finger: where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark that spot with ink.
Take a knife-like scalpel, known as the 'nasila', and insert it under the vein into the skin until you reach the bone with the tip of the blade. Then lift your hand, pulling the vein and skin upwards, and cut through the vein and the skin in one clean slice; make the cut about two fingers' length.
Or similar, and you can release as much blood as you wish to. Then bind them tightly with bandages until they heal; earlier in the book I mentioned an alternative procedure of cutting and cauterizing these veins. As for the two arteries in the temples, their ligation is beneficial for chronic migraines, severe headaches, persistent conjunctivitis, and the acute discharge of humors into the eyes.
And the method of clamping them as I describe to you: The patient should tighten their neck with a turban so that the two veins are clearly perceptible to touch, and their pulse is evident beneath your finger. Then mark them with ink, and lift the skin above the vein upwards towards above with your index finger.
Insert the scalpel from below and lift the vein upwards, severing it as you did with the other two veins. Allow the blood to flow as needed, then release the patient's neck restraint and place your finger on the vein for a moment.
Then place a piece of cotton and a bandage over it, tightening firmly from above. Leave it until it heals; their mention, cutting, and drawing have already been covered at the beginning of this book. As for clamping the vein on the forehead, its benefit follows that of clamping the temple veins for chronic ailments of the face such as tinea, ulcers, and unsightly redness.
The method of clamping, as I describe it to you: The patient should tighten their neck with a turban until the vein is visible. Then take the instrument known as the 'axe', which can be seen in this illustration:
Place the protruding spike from the head of the axe onto the same vein and strike it from above with a comb or some other similar object in that direction. Allow blood to flow as much as you desire, then release the patient's neck restraint and tighten until healing occurs.
It may also be opened with a broad scalpel, but it should not have a sharp tip like other scalpels; rather, its end should be slightly wider. Clamp it in an oblique manner because the bone is nearby and if the scalpel is thin, it might break.
As for the two veins in the corners of the eyes, their benefit is for eye ailments such as scabies, redness, ptosis, and facial diseases. To cauterize them, the patient should tighten his neck with a bandage, then you cauterize while standing over his head. The cauterization should be done with a small, slightly wide scalpel, angled slightly towards the length.
If the area has no flesh, then if the scalpel is thin it may break. Then release as much blood as you need and place cotton on them, tightening for one night before removing it. As for cauterizing the nose vein, it is beneficial for acute fever.
It is also beneficial for severe headaches and facial diseases such as erysipelas, which appears on the nose, especially if it is chronic. To cauterize, the patient should tighten their neck, then you hold their nose with your left hand and take a thin, long scalpel.
You insert it into the middle of the nose tip, between where the nostrils meet along a straight line because the vein cannot be felt there; blood will emerge immediately. You should press down slightly with your hand on the scalpel and release as much blood as you need, then tie it for one night as it heals quickly.
As for the two veins on the temples, their benefit is for shortness of breath, early leprosy, and melancholic diseases that appear on the skin's surface such as vitiligo, eczema, and malignant ulcers. To cauterize them, the patient should tighten a bandage under them around his neck, then you stand over the patient's head.
The patient should sit on a chair, then you cauterize the vein along its length with a slightly wide incision, releasing a moderate amount of blood or as much as you deem necessary; do likewise to the other vein, then untie the bandage.
Tighten the two tendons with a moderate pull so that the patient does not suffocate, and leave them until tomorrow; then the wound will be healed. As for the four tendons, the benefit of their incision after the incisions in the cephalic vein is that it helps with cankers in the mouth, gum disorders, bad sores, chapped lips, and malignant ulcers.
Those that are in the nose and its surroundings, and how to incise them is by having the patient sit in front of you and tightening their neck with a bandage; then turn their lips and look for the two tendons which one can see on the right side of the lip while the other is seen on the left side. The blackness [of these veins] make them easily identifiable.
And that is also because there are thin, black tendons around them so cut them with a clean cut. If it looks confusing to you and you don't know which ones they are then aim for the largest and most prominent one; do likewise with the two veins that are in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, the benefit of their incision after the cephalic vein is [remedying] goitres that are in the throat from uvula illness and mouth diseases; how to incise them is by having the patient sit between your hands facing the sun while you lift up their tongue, look underneath it towards one side for a tendon and on the other side for another. Their colour tends towards black.
Then you incise them and be careful, do not cut too deeply because underneath are arteries; perhaps a bleeding of blood from those arteries will occur. As for the three tendons that are usually incised in the elbow in people in general their incision can take two forms.
Either by using a broad, basil-shaped lancet or an olive-shaped one towards being thin; or else with the slit of a knife-like lancet which is called nashl. This is its image: Image of the broad, basil-shaped lancet.
It should be broad enough to open the hollow, full, prominent veins that are visible and thick, containing dark, viscous blood. This is an illustration of the olive-shaped scalpel.
This scalpel is less wide and has a finer tip, suitable for lancing thin veins that contain light yellow blood. This is an illustration of the needle-shaped scalpel.
This needle is suitable for incising, and there are different types: broad and narrow, according to the size of the veins they are used on. This concept can be applied to other instruments, which are well-known among craftsmen.
The basilic vein, one of the three mentioned, is beneficial to lance because it drains blood from ailments below the throat and neck, towards the chest and abdomen. The surgeon should be cautious when lancing it and keep their hands away from the neck, as beneath it runs an artery; if they make a mistake and go too deep with the scalpel, that artery may be severed.
This may cause blood loss, so it should not be lanced with a standard scalpel but rather incised with a needle. If the basilic vein is not clearly visible, one should avoid it and instead opt for an alternative or request that some of its branches are found.
Or you may lance the place of the brachial artery, which is evident; incise it with a needle-scalpel as mentioned earlier. If you wish to specifically lance the vein, you should first feel for its pulse by palpating the area and mark that spot with ink.
Then you should bind the arm and lance the vein with a sweeping incision using the needle-scalpel, taking care not to strike too close to the artery. When you see signs of swelling at the marked spot upon tightening the ligature, avoid that area as it indicates the position of the inflated artery.
If you see blood at the incision leaping like a boy's urine and if it is thin, red in color, then know that it is from an artery. Then proceed to place your finger upon it for quite some time before removing it. If the bleeding stops after releasing your finger, often times it does. Tighten the arm.
Leave it, and warn the patient to take care of it without being neglectful; make sure they are in bed and do not move them for days until healing occurs. If bleeding does not stop, and you struggle with stopping it despite having no medication available at that time - sever the artery if this is visible to you; both ends contract leading to cessation of blood flow.
Or take a walnut skin, cut it open and use only one half - compress this firmly on the affected area with bandages and supporting material for another day; if bleeding stops then fine, otherwise treat as previously mentioned by applying powders to stop blood flow. This treatment is not always difficult.
The site of the small wound and secure bandaging in the arm should be noted; as for the brachial artery, its benefit is to draw blood from both the top of the head and lower body due to it being composed of branches originating from both the basilic and cephalic veins, as previously stated.
The person performing the incision should be cautious and avoid damaging any nerve beneath, as excessive incisions with a scalpel can lead to numbness which may prove difficult to cure or never heal at all; this nerve is often perceptible by touch.
If it is not easily discernible in some people due to being thin and inconspicuous, you should instead make a small incision with forceps; avoid the nerve as much as possible - if there are nerves on either side of the vein then incise lengthwise along this vein; as for the cephalic vein, its purpose is drawing blood away from the head.
It is useful for eye diseases, and it is recommended in this vein specifically that if you wish to puncture it; <puncture it> do so by sewing with an olive-shaped scalpel or a wide basil-shaped lancet because it is the safest of all veins as there are no arteries or nerves underneath.
However, when puncturing, one should avoid the head of the muscle and aim for the soft spot; it is not harmful if it does not succeed on the first strike to be punctured multiple times except that it may swell in some people if it is not struck on the first attempt.
But that swelling does not harm it; as for the technique of puncturing, its symptoms, and what is recommended to precede its repair, first one should know that puncturing can be used either to preserve health or...
Or it can be used in diseases; when used to preserve and maintain health, and to prevent the occurrence of illnesses, puncturing should be done on one of the three veins at the elbow: the cephalic vein, the radial artery, or the basilic vein; puncturing should be performed early in spring if signs of fullness appear.
Puncturing, when used for diseases, does not have a specific time limit; it should be done whenever the need and necessity arise, day or night.
It can be done at any hour and at any time; boys should not be punctured until they are fourteen years old, and the elderly over sixty should not undergo the procedure. If anyone intends to puncture for any reason...
His bowels should be cleansed by means of a soft clyster before bloodletting, if there is a large amount of retained faeces, lest any foul humours from the intestines might be drawn into the veins during bleeding and thus harm vital organs. A patient who has overeaten or drunk alcohol should not undergo bloodletting until these conditions have passed.
Bloodletting should also be avoided following diarrhoea, vomiting, menstruation, excessive sexual intercourse, physical exertion, exercise, loss of sleep, fasting and anything else that weakens either the body or mind. The thickness of blood is then considered before proceeding with any treatment.
If possible, he should adjust his diet to include foods and drinks that help thin the blood as well as take medicines for this purpose. If there are no medical contraindications, a visit to the baths or taking some exercise may also help achieve this goal. Bloodletting is then performed early in the day, as previously mentioned, ensuring that all negative mental states are absent from his mind on that particular day.
Such as worry, anger and fear, avoiding all physical factors like excessive fatigue or exertion and sexual intercourse, etc. The patient should also be placed in an environment that fosters positive mental states. This can be achieved by surrounding him with items known to produce pleasant sensations such as perfumes, flowers or entertainment, each tailored according to individual preferences.
The bloodletter sits on a cushion that is slightly higher than the one occupied by his patient. He then rubs the latter’s arm twice or thrice with his hand before fastening the ligature around it using a cord and twisting said ligature two to three times, ensuring that the tightness of this tourniquet is moderate.
Because when the tourniquet is too tight, it stops blood flow; if, on the other hand, it is too loose, then likewise there will be no effect upon circulation. Therefore following its application the patient should rub both hands together vigorously.
Until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch, then the phlebotomist should rub the scalpel with a little old oil. He should then place his left index finger on the same vein, slightly below the site he intends to open, so that it does not move away when struck. For some veins you find are like strings, they move away when opened; others are full of air and whenever the scalpel is placed on them, they become depressed beneath it and deceive the phlebotomist so that he cannot open them properly or only opens a small gap.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should remain firm and take his time with all these matters; then he should lower the scalpel. If he succeeds in opening the vein on that attempt, well and good; otherwise, he must repeat the procedure slightly below or above that spot swiftly if there is no swelling.
But if the vein swells or the patient becomes frightened, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the ligature; perhaps this has caused a hot swelling. The patient should also avoid the bathhouse; then he may return to have his blood let again if he wishes. If the scalpel is inserted and the opening is small with thin blood flowing from it...
If you fear that the amount of blood will not reach your desired limit, return the scalpel to the same hole gently and with care; make it a bit wider but do so quickly before the spot swells. Such swelling often occurs in many people when there is only a small opening.
If you see that it has swelled, do not return to it at all; it will be of no use. Instead, place some oil residue upon the spot; this facilitates blood flow and is better for this purpose than pure oil or any other ointment.
Use the oil thickener for all venesections of vessels when blood flow is obstructed. The antidote known as 'triaq faruq' and 'shakhzanaya' may also be used; if either is applied to the site, then the blood will thin and dissolve if it has thickened.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of venesection, it often does so, especially in those who have never undergone phlebotomy or if the vessel opening is small; act quickly and place over the swelling a sponge soaked in warm water and salt, then bind it for an hour. It will dissolve.
You should do this after all the blood has drained from that vessel or another one; if a trace of blackness or greenness remains at the site in subsequent days, it will cause no harm. If you wish to remove these traces, apply some dissolved aloe and myrobalan.
Or use the juice of fodanj and its likes; swelling or knots often occur when venesecting the basilic vein, so place your hand upon it: if it feels soft under pressure then it is a bad knot and you must avoid applying anything we have mentioned to it.
But bind it with something astringent to harden the site, then treat it as described previously until it heals; you should take blood from everyone in proportion to their strength and according to the prevailing colour of their blood.
If the blood is black, allow it to come out until it becomes red; and if you see it as thick, send it forth until it thins; likewise with sharp blood, let it flow until its sharpness diminishes. Whoever is full-bodied and strong yet requires a single phlebotomy treatment...
Widen the phlebotomy vein and use a broad lancet; for one who is weak, do the opposite. The blood should be extracted in several rounds, and the hole should be narrow. The best way to perform phlebotomy is with an oblique incision, not a puncture.
This type of phlebotomy is safe from bleeding and nerve damage, being the best and safest form of phlebotomy; for those who are used to fainting during this procedure, they should be given some bread soaked in pomegranate juice or vinegar before the operation.
If the patient is febrile and blood has been extracted three or four times, then if he is of a cold temperament, he should take bread soaked in mead wine, honey wine seasoned with spices, or sweet basil wine before the procedure.
If fainting occurs during the procedure and it is due to excessive blood loss, then the patient should be given meat broth and light basil wine; they should also use aromatic galbanum, loosen their chest with it, and make use of all that we have mentioned in the section on syncope.
For those who wish to invigorate their arm and regulate their blood, if the patient requires extensive phlebotomy and their strength is weak, then the blood should be let out little by little according to their strength over several days.
If one wishes to invigorate their arm and regulate their blood, and their body is strong, then they should do so seven or nine hours after the first procedure; if one wishes to draw the blood from a part of the body that has become congested, then it should be done on the second or third day.
For those with excessive, heated blood and inflammation causing a fever, the blood should be extracted in one single session, removing a large amount and widening the opening until faintness occurs after ensuring all venesection conditions are met. Place your hand on their pulse as the blood drains to prevent death instead of faintness, for this often occurs when the venesectionist is ignorant and careless. It must not be done if you wish to release the arm and let the blood flow again.
If the vein opening closes and blood flow is hindered, press on it firmly or twist forcefully; this is quite harmful. Instead, either leave it until the next venesection or use a scalpel blade to remove any coagulated blood from the vein opening.
Alternatively, apply some salt dissolved in water or some 'triac farouq' (universal antidote) or 'shikhzanaia', and gently press [the vein] until the blood flows. If the vein swells, leave it alone.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If a second bloodletting is necessary, then either do so above that spot or in the other arm or vein.
As for venesection of the arm cord, it is done in place of the radial and ulnar arteries if they cannot be found or are hidden because [the arm cord] comprises these two. The procedure is that the patient inserts their hand into warm water until the forearm reddens and the vein becomes clearly visible; then, a moderate-tightness bandage is applied just above it.
Then open the vein with a slight deviation, neither sideways nor lengthwise. Make your incision wide and make sure it is above the wrist joint slightly. If blood does not flow out then place the hand again in a vessel of hot water and let the blood run into the water.
[Until you have achieved your goal], if it is during the summer days, you may dispense with placing the hand again in hot water. But mostly what makes blood flow into hot water [is done] during winter time; opening this vein is safer than all other veins. Because beneath it there is no large vein or nerve, and as for opening the vein on the right hand side [known] as 'al-asylim', this is beneficial for liver ailments. The method of opening it is that you should bind the wrist with a bandage or with your own hand after dipping it into hot water until the vein becomes swollen.
Because beneath it there is no large vein or nerve, and as for opening the vein on the right hand side [known] as 'al-asylim', this is beneficial for liver ailments. The method of opening it is that you should bind the wrist with a bandage or with your own hand after dipping it into hot water until the vein becomes swollen. The pulsation can be felt quite clearly, then open it with a slight deviation and even if you sever it completely this will not harm him at all; take care [not to cut too deeply]. Do not apply your knife forcefully because beneath it lies the nerve of the fingers, and the area is bare of flesh. Then place the hand again in hot water.
Let the blood flow from it, for if you do not place [the hand] again in hot water then the blood will congeal at the mouth of the vein and cease to flow. When you have extracted as much blood as is needed, apply ointment and salt to the vein so that it may heal slowly.
You should do likewise for every small [vein], and as for the benefit of opening it on the left hand, this is beneficial for spleen ailments; you should perform the incision in the same manner as with the second one described above. As for the saphenous vein, its opening benefits ailments located lower down in the body such as those affecting the womb.
Retention of menstruation, kidney diseases, chronic ulcers on the thighs and legs, and similar ailments; how to treat it: He should immerse his leg in hot water and massage it vigorously until the veins fill with blood, then they should be tightly bound above the ankle with a bandage at the place where the vein is visible just behind the heel.
It has many branches on the surface of the leg, so cup at its widest part or near the heel where all the veins converge; this is better and safer. If you cup on the surface of the leg, take care to avoid the nerves underneath.
Make your cupping resemble an amputation, using a blunt knife. If blood does not flow easily, return his leg to the hot water and allow it to circulate until it is exhausted. If the cupper misses the vein with his first incision,
He should repeat the incision a little higher, for this area is safe and presents no danger if you avoid the nerves as mentioned before. You may proceed in the same way with the saphenous vein of the other leg; its location, as said before, is at the heel on the outer side.
The benefit of cupping for hip pain, when this is caused by hot blood; how to proceed: The patient should enter the bath and briskly pull his leg, from hip to four finger-breadths above the heel, with a long thin bandage.
When it appears, cup it in whatever way you find easiest; either with a blunt knife, which is better, or by severing and opening it directly: the area is safe. In most people, this vein is very deeply hidden, so if you cannot find it,
If the clot cannot be felt at all, open some of its branches which appear on the back of the foot towards the little and ring fingers, but take care to avoid the nerves; then let out as much blood as you wish.
Then relax the tension, place some cotton wool on the site of the venesection, and bandage it up; it will heal quickly.
Chapter 96.
On cupping, and how to use it.
Cupping instruments can be made from horns, wood, copper and glass; cupping comes in two forms - one is to make an incision and remove blood, the other is without any incisions.
This cupping procedure that involves no incisions also comes in two forms...
Another site is both sides of the neck, another is under the lower jaw and yet another is beneath the mouth; there's also both shoulders, the coccyx, both forearms, both legs and both heels.
Cupping draws blood from the fine veins scattered through the flesh, and for this reason its force doesn't drop off like venesection; it shouldn't be used in diseases caused by over-abundance whether with fire or without.
If the need for cupping arises due to illness or as a customary practice, we use it at any time: in the beginning of the month, its end, and anytime in between.
This is because among people, there are those who when have an excess of blood and need to release it through cupping, experience a feeling of heaviness and headache in their heads. Some find fullness and redness in their faces, heads, and necks; others feel itching on their faces, sides, darkness, and puffiness in their eyes. There are also those who scratch the site of their cupping.
Some laugh excessively, while others taste blood in their mouths, and their gums become sore with bloody saliva. Some sleep a lot; others see blood, redness, corpses, wounds, and the like in their dreams. Whenever we observe any of these symptoms...
Especially if it occurs in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours have passed from daylight. As for the benefit of cupping at the nape, it is helpful for relieving heaviness in the head and water pouring into the eyes.
But it should be done after purging the entire body. This cupping can replace venesection at the temple, but one must beware of using it if they have a cold brain or are suffering from catarrh; it will cause them great harm.
For this reason, it should not be used by the elderly or those with cold ailments in their heads; excessive use can lead to forgetfulness.
And so, one should order the cupper to slightly lower their hands with the cups in order to avoid causing forgetfulness. As for cupping at the scapula, it replaces venesection at the radial artery and the median cubital vein.
It is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, coughing, and fullness. The cupping on the upper back should be slightly lifted because if it's done lower, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
Cupping on the neck is beneficial for pains occurring in the head, eye inflammation, migraines, sore throat, and toothache. It can be used instead of venesection at the ankle. You should instruct the cupper not to go too deep with the incision to avoid cutting an artery and causing bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is helpful for mouth sores, gum disease, and other oral issues. It can serve as an alternative to venesection on the lips. Cupping on the shoulders aids with palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
Cupping on the lower part of the forearms is beneficial for the same conditions as venesection at the three veins: the basilic, median, and cephalic veins. It draws blood from all those thin veins in the flesh and pulls that blood out of other thicker veins until it reaches the three thickest veins.
You should tell the cupper not to make deep incisions because the area is lacking flesh and has nerves and arteries underneath. Single cupping at the coccyx, meanwhile, helps with hemorrhoids around the anus and sores in that region.
Instruct the cupper to use a large copper cup because the area needs strong suction, and a glass cup might break and cause excessive incision. As for cupping on the legs, it noticeably reduces fullness.
For it attracts blood from the entire body and is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, womb, and bladder; it induces menstruation, treats blisters and furuncles, and serves as an alternative to venesection of the gastrocnemius and Achilles tendon; however, it greatly weakens the body and causes syncope in most people. Cupping on the Achilles tendon has a similar benefit to cupping on the legs.
The way to place the cups is as follows: first, place the cup empty and suck it moderately; do not prolong the placement of the cups but rather place them quickly and remove them swiftly so that the humors come to the site evenly. Keep repeating this process until you see the area turn red and open up.
Once the blood appears red, make an incision and resume sucking gradually. Then examine the state of the bodies: for those with soft flesh and porous skin, only one incision should be made to prevent the site from ulcerating.
Instruct the cupper to widen and deepen the incision slightly, adjusting the sucking gently with a soft movement. If the blood is thick, two incisions should be made: the first to open up an avenue for the thin and aqueous part of the blood; the second to extract the thicker blood.
If the blood is very cloudy, a third incision should be made to reach the desired extent. In general, if we want to extract little blood, one incision suffices; for extracting more blood, make multiple incisions; and if we expect thick blood.
A deep incision should be made, with the limit being the depth of the skin only. We must consider what oils to use when placing the cups and which waters to avoid for the cupped. For those with thick, dry, tough skin and tight pores...
One should anoint the cupping sites with opening, softening, and resolving ointments; if it is during summer, then use oils such as caper oil, violet oil, sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
If it is during winter, then use oils such as narcissus oil, iris oil, chamomile oil, or lily oil; if the obstruction is thick and cold, then let the ointment be marjoram oil, sage oil, pine oil, or dill oil.
If the person undergoing cupping has wide pores and soft flesh, ointments should be avoided; they should wash their cupped areas after the procedure with rose water or cold water, gooseberry water, pumpkin water, portulaca water, or similar.
If their blood is moist, they should wash the cupped areas with vinegar or myrtle and sumac water; if the obstruction is thick, then let them use aged wine, marjoram water, dill stew, chamomile, and so on. Cupping should be avoided in a bathhouse and after using one.
It should be used an hour or two after leaving the bathhouse, and one should not sleep after cupping; this is what should be considered by someone undergoing cupping and bloodletting before and after the procedure.
First, you should consider whether the person undergoing cupping or bloodletting is choleric and has predominantly sharp and inflammatory blood; in such a case, they should take cooling substances like pomegranates, chicory with vinegar, lettuce, skimmed wine, jellies, and so on. Their food should be young chickens, lamb meat as stew, sour foods, etc.
For one whose temperament is cold, it is necessary to drink mead and wine made from honey or caperberry vinegar (syrup), or the *Succursus Berytheus*, and take aromatic wine of medium age, which is between old and new, and they should be prescribed a light diet. Their food should consist of chickens, quails, sparrows, pigeons, and young doves (*Asfidjabaj*). On days when they have had venesection or cupping, drinks must be more plentiful than food.
Sometimes it may be necessary to give some people theriac, musk medicine or *Shiltha* before venesection and cupping or afterwards to strengthen the principal organs and thin out the blood; but this should not be given to those who are overheated.
As for the unbladed cups, they are those which are placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, belly, navel, kidney region and hip bone because these organs cannot endure scarification; rather what is intended by their use is either to draw blood from one organ to another.
Like when we place the cup over the breasts in cases of nosebleed, or use it to dispel cold wind trapped in a certain organ as by placing the cup on belly and navel; for this loosens the organ, warms it up and dispels pain due to its release of that wind.
It may be placed on the kidney if there is a blockage or stone, for by its strong drawing action it might open up the blockage or dislodge the stone from where it was; and similarly when placed over liver and spleen in cases of wind-disturbance, these unbladed cups can be used merely to suck without introducing any medicated substance.
Or it can be used with fire, or filled with lukewarm water in cases of *sciatica*; fill a large cup with hot water alone, or with water that has been boiled with certain herbs suited to this purpose.
Then it is placed full on the spot and held in place and removed, then replaced multiple times as needed. This is an illustration of the fire syringe:.
The capacity of its mouth is the size of two opened fingers as shown, and in depth it measures half a span. It has a small hole on its side, towards its middle, large enough to admit a needle. It can be made from either tinned copper or brass with thick edges.
Smooth and flat, polished so as not to injure the organ when applied; it has in its center a cross-bar of either brass or iron where the wax candle is placed upon the fire. This fire syringe can be made larger than that previously described or smaller depending on the condition.
The technique of using this fire syringe upon the organ is as follows: first light a linen wick or small wax candle with pitch, then place it in the middle of the penis tube inside the syringe.
This allows the fire to rise upwards towards the base of the syringe, so as not to burn the patient's body; then it is placed on the organ with a finger over the mentioned hole until we hold firmly the syringe and remove the finger.
Steam will then escape from that hole, and the syringe is loosened in place; relight the wick as described previously, and repeat if necessary. Regarding the water syringe used for treating penile curvature, there is no need for a rigid penis tube or any holes.
It is used by filling it with water, then placing on the organ; this is an illustration of the said syringe:.
This is the syringe; the larger it is and the more water it can hold, the better.
Chapter 77.
On the use of leeches.
Leeches are used in most cases for members where cups cannot be placed, either due to their small size, such as the lip and gums, or because the member is devoid of flesh, like fingers and noses.
The way to use leeches is to collect them from fresh, clean water devoid of contamination; they are then left for a day and night in fresh water so that they become hungry and have emptied their stomachs. The body is then purged, either by bleeding or cupping, before the afflicted member is cleaned.
Once the leech is full, it will fall off on its own; if possible, suck the wound with a syringe for added benefit; otherwise, wash the wound with vinegar and then lots of water while massaging and squeezing it. If blood continues to flow after the leech has fallen off and this becomes a problem, dampen some linen in cold water.
Place the linen cloth on top until the bleeding stops; if blood flow is excessive, sprinkle powdered white vitriol or oak gall over it (or some other astringent) until the bleeding stops, or apply shelled broad beans to the wound.
Leave the broad beans in place until they stick to the wound, which will stop the bleeding. If you need to use leeches again, don't reuse any that have already been used if possible; if a leech refuses to attach itself to the wound, clean it with fresh blood.
If you insert a needle in the location until some blood oozes out, then apply it [the medicine], since if it comes into contact with any blood, it will stick to the wound. When you want to remove it, sprinkle on it a little aloe, or salt, or ashes; and it will fall off.
Chapter three.
In algebra.
This chapter is also necessary in medical practice, which concerns setting bones and reducing fractures of the bones.
Be aware, my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and laymen who have not browsed a single book of the ancients nor read even one letter from them.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become non-existent in our country and I have never come across anyone who is competent in it whatsoever. What I have learnt from it, is due to my lengthy reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them so that I may extract their knowledge; then after that, I practiced and trained throughout my life.
I have explained to you in this chapter everything that I know about it. My experience with it has gone beyond what I have presented to you, after having brought the subject closer to your understanding and clarified it for you by removing all unnecessary details; I have also summarised its important points as much as possible while making them clear to understand, adding many different illustrations of instruments used in this art.
For this is an addition to my explanation as I did in the previous two chapters, and there is no strength except through Allah, the Exalted, the Great.
Chapter One.
There are comprehensive statements about bone fractures, and it is necessary to present them first. Before we begin discussing each broken or dislocated member individually, we should mention some general principles at the beginning of this chapter. It first requires you to understand its true nature, both of you and those eager to learn this noble profession besides yourself.
So I say, whenever a fracture or dislocation occurs in any part of the body, it is necessary to hasten first to its bleeding [fistulation] or purging or both together. Unless there is a contra-indication, such as weakness or if the patient happens to be either an infant or old and decrepit, or unless the season is extremely hot or very severely cold.
Then he should restrict his diet to cold pulses, fowls and young goats; and all drinks, meats of a gross nature, fullness of food and any kind of nourishment which fills the veins with blood must be prohibited until you are sure that there is no danger of swelling and you do not expect any extravasation of material into the affected part.
Then the patient may return to his usual regimen, and as soon as you see that the broken bone is beginning to knit, he should nourish himself with abundant, gross nourishment of a firm consistency which has some viscosity in it; such as porridge, rice, heads, trotters and cow's guts. Eggs, soft fish, and gross liquors are also good for this purpose; by such a regimen the knitting of the fracture will be quicker and more satisfactory. Note that broken bones in hale men or old persons never quite regain their original condition but remain slightly stiffened.
The softness and pliability of their bones, and how they may connect and fuse together, even the most delicate bones like those of small children. Nature generates a substance resembling glue on all sides of the broken bone that is thick and sticky, drawing it together and strengthening it until the pieces are firmly attached to each other.
And it binds them together until they become incredibly strong and secure, just as they were initially, so that nothing hinders their actions.
For this reason, the patient's diet should consist of foods that are sturdy, sticky, and thick, as we have said. Understand that fractures can vary depending on the affected body part because a fracture in the leg bone is different from one in the skull, and so forth.
Similarly, all other body parts differ from each other, and we will discuss each type of fracture in detail under its respective heading, distinct from the others. The nature of a bone fracture can also vary within itself.
For instance, it could be a clean break without any splintering or shattering, or it may occur along the length of the bone with splinters and fragments that are either detached or not. The fracture can also involve a skin wound and perforation, or it might be a simple crack.
Each type of fracture has its own specific method for setting it, as will be detailed later in the appropriate sections. Bone fractures can be identified by various signs such as deformation, swelling, and tenderness to the touch, or a cracking sound when gently prodded with your hand.
If there is no visible deformation, no sound upon gentle prodding, no tenderness when palpated, and the patient does not experience significant pain, then it likely isn't a fracture but rather a sprain or minor crack that should be left undisturbed.
Indeed, treat it with the medicines that will be mentioned later on, which are suitable for the location; then bind it gently and know that if a bone is broken into two pieces without splintering and the parts separate from each other.
You should promptly set and align it before any hot swelling occurs; if hot swelling does occur, leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides, then align it with whatever gentle means and ingenuity you can manage.
Know that its healing and alignment are easier than those of a bone with splinters; it is then bound as will be mentioned later. If the bone has splinters, the broken limb must be stretched from both sides, whether hand or foot.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or a rope and hand; place the limb on an even surface in its natural shape so that when the broken bone parts are stretched, you can then return those protruding pieces to their places by whatever means of ingenuity and gentleness you can manage.
Be as careful as you can to not cause the patient pain or distress by your actions, and do your best to bring one bone into contact with its fellow in the best way possible; at that time, you must touch them both and feel them with your hand; if you see any discrepancies, correct and align them to the best of your ability.
Beware of excessive stretching and strong manipulation as many ignorant people do, often causing hot swelling or chronic disability in the limb, as I have seen happen repeatedly from their actions.
Then, after smoothing and perfecting the tightening of that member, oblige it to remain still and calm. Warn the patient not to move it during their wakefulness or sleep, while turning over, struggling, defecating, or any other movement they make, as far as possible. Ensure that the position of the member is one where pain can be avoided.
For when, during the erection of that member, they feel pain or discomfort, advise them to move it into a position where such pain is absent and one which sees it erect in a straight and level manner.
This is to avoid the member becoming crooked if it is forced in this way; and as for how one should tighten a broken member, know that such members differ in their size, shape and form - take, for example, the arm, finger or forearm.
Thus, the rags used should be soft and gentle for smaller members; whereas those that are larger such as the thigh, back or chest, should have a wide bandage so to ensure it remains firmly in place - tightening them evenly from all sides without movement.
Then, having completed the process of smoothing, you should commence with applying an appropriate coating. Using a soft cloth, begin to coat the site of the fracture and then start wrapping the bandage around it three or four times depending on the size of the member - tightening slightly as you go before moving upwards towards the upper portion.
Tighten the bandage less firmly than at the fracture site itself and, as you move further away from it, gradually loosen the tension slightly until a suitable level is achieved - then take another bandage and wrap that around the fractured area.
Bandages are then taken and applied to the lower part of the fracture. You should tighten or loosen the bandage as described for the first upper bandage. Then, place between the bandages some soft padding or cloth to even out any irregularities in the fracture.
If there is no deformity, do not put anything inside; then bandage over it with another bandage and apply the splints on top of these bandages from your kit if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply what will reduce the swelling and eliminate the congestion; leave it for a few days before applying the splints. The splints should be made from wise-cut wide halves of reed, well prepared, or they could be made from wooden grating boards.
which are made from pine, palm leaves, heather, or similar materials that may be available; and each splint should have this size, shape, and design.
Except that the splint placed directly on the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints; as for the length of the splint, it is made according to what suits the broken limb in its size, being large or small. Splint design:.
Then bandage over the splints with another bandage in exactly the same way as you did for the first one; and tie it from above firmly with threads, as described before, making sure to tighten more at the site of the fracture. The further away from the fracture, the less you should tighten.
The threads should be of moderate thickness and softness, and preferably made from damp linen; using thick threads like those used by ignorant people - who make their threads from twisted strips of flax - is a great mistake.
Because it [the bone] is pulled out of alignment, and the fine threads are also not suitable because you cannot achieve the desired tension with them, and there should be no less than a finger's width between splints.
If the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after being pulled into correct positions, place soft padding or fluffed wool underneath them so that nothing hurts him/her in this manner. If a break occurs with an injury and there is a breach of skin, we will discuss it separately.
Know that it is not necessary to apply splints to every broken limb from the very first day, for if a limb is large, then one should not put on splints until after five or seven days, or more according to when you feel certain that hot swelling will not occur.
Here is a description of the bandages used by earlier practitioners to treat fractures, dislocations and sprains; a concise general purpose bandage that fixes broken bones and can be adapted for most temperaments, especially children and women as it is not overly hot or cold.
The process is as follows: take flour dust, which is the bran that sticks to the mill walls when it moves during grinding; mix this without sieving and knead with egg white until you achieve a paste of neither thick nor thin consistency then use it [as bandage].
A further bandage for broken bones, dislocations and sprains is made from: masha seed, ladan gum, acacia, rhus and skunk cabbage each at 10 dirhams; myrrh and aloe vera each at 5 dirhams; elder at 20 dirhams; Armenian or Roman clay also at 20 dirhams. Everyone pounds it and mixes it with rosewater or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot, then this dressing should be used; its composition is good as it sets the broken bones rapidly and is suitable for most people due to its moderate nature.
Another dressing useful for fractures and sprains: take ten drachms each of mallow, vetch and white marshmallow, five drachms each of myrrh and aloe, six drachms of acacia and twenty drachms of Armenian clay; pound them all finely, sieve and mix with water or egg white. Apply as required.
A dressing for joints and bones that have moved from their places, it eases the pain associated with them, as well as bone splitting and fractures: take white wool, soak in vinegar and boiled oil and apply to the affected area. This dressing has no power of setting broken bones.
But it is excellent in reducing hot swellings and relieving pain specifically; another dressing recipe that sets broken bones: take fig leaves and wild poppy leaves, pound together and apply moist to the body. Another short recipe for use when a bone fracture has set.
And you want to treat the remaining swelling, take marshmallow root, chamomile, violets and carline thistle flour in equal parts; pound all together and mix with liniment unless it is an inflamed limb, then use coriander water or plain water instead. Apply as required.
Another dressing, more powerful in reducing swelling than the first recipe; to be used when a hard lump occurs at the site of bone fracture: take marshmallow root, flax seed, fenugreek, crown imperial, marjoram, violets, chamomile, all in equal parts.
Everyone pounds and kneads [the ingredients] with distilled water, fresh water or ointment; all depending on the heat of the limb and the calming of its fever. Hippocrates, however, did not mention in his book that it should be applied to a broken limb when setting it.
Except for the tar-like substance made only of wax and oil, which should be medium thickness; while Galen suggested that substances containing astringents with some warmth, such as myrrh, aloe and frankincense (and similar items mentioned), should be applied to broken limbs when setting them.
A dressing useful for weakness and pain is made from: mugwort, chickpeas, human hair (or bird feathers), mallow root, and salt; in equal parts, pounded, sieved, then kneaded together with enough water or oil to make a paste which should be applied as a poultice. As to the amount of bandage required...
Then remove the dressing; this is done by checking for any pain or itching, and ensuring that the broken bone has not moved from its position. If there are no such signs then leave it on for many days. However if severe itching occurs in the area, or distressing pain, or swelling...
Then promptly remove it and do not delay; take away the dressing, then get a soft cloth or sea sponge that is damp with tepid water, wash the area until the itching and pain calm down; then leave the limb to rest for an hour.
Next, apply wool that has been soaked in vinegar and oil (or rosewater) to the area; tie it there for a night until you are confident of no hot swelling or limb distension nor pain, then put on gentle pressure with light dressings but do not tighten as before.
Treat it gently until it heals, and if you find that the swelling, redness, pain, and puffiness - along with all other symptoms have disappeared, then bandage and bind it again as you did before, evenly. If none of the mentioned symptoms appear in the limb.
Do not remove it until after three or four, five, or seven days - and up to twenty days if that is what you see fit for the condition of the limb as we have said; so when the fracture has healed and the flesh has knitted together.
Then increase the binding further, more than the first time and also make sure to feed the patient with even thicker, richer food than previously mentioned; if you find that the broken limb has become dried out or emaciated - beyond what is normal then know that nourishment cannot reach it.
Soak it in warm water each time you remove the binding - do this every three days and loosen the bandage slightly, for with these actions nourishment will reach the limb and it shall heal quickly; as for what ignorant bone-setters might do by breaking the member again.
If it had not healed correctly the first time and is now set crookedly, then this is a mistake of their doing - a great risk; even if it were correct I would have found some mention of it in the works of previous scholars and they would have put it into practice but I saw no such trace from any of them whatsoever. And indeed, one should not do so.
Chapter Two.
On fractures of the skull.
The types of accidental fractures in the head are many, their shapes varied, and their causes diverse. Some fractures occur due to a sword blow and may involve complete breakage of the bone down to the membrane beneath it. Just as an adze does to wood.
This type of fracture is called adze-like, or the sword may have cut through part of the bone and broken its surface without penetrating further, which is known as an absolute avulsion fracture; these two types of fractures can produce either large or small wounds.
Some fractures are comminuted or depressed, caused by a blow from a stone, a fall onto a stone, or the like; these fractures may either penetrate close to the membrane beneath the bone or remain on the surface of the bone.
The wounds from these fractures can also be either large or small; some fractures are subtle, occurring within the thinness of hair on bone and representing a minor fissure.
This type of fracture is called capillary; a fracture resulting from a fall or blow from a stone or the like, where part of the bone's membrane shifts inward, creating an indentation similar to that which occurs when a copper pot is struck and its surface dents inward.
This type of fracture is most common in the soft heads of infants, though it can occur elsewhere; there may be fractured bone fragments present or not, and we will discuss treatment for each type later; these fracture types are identified through physical examination.
These fractures are probed with instruments and any rotten flesh is removed; capillary fractures are identified by wiping the bone with ink, as the fracture will appear black; treatment for these fractures first involves assessing the patient's symptoms.
If you observe symptoms that clearly indicate fear, such as vomiting bile, extension [of the body], loss of reason, hoarseness, fainting, acute fever, protruding and reddened eyes, and other similar signs, do not approach the patient or treat them, for death will surely claim them in most cases.
And if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and believe the patient will recover, then begin their treatment. This is when the wounded person comes to you soon after being injured during the winter days.
You should make every effort to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, under any circumstances. If it is during the summer days, you must hasten to extract the bone before the seventh day, lest the membrane beneath the bone becomes corrupted, leading to the symptoms we have described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is also a shattered and crushed condition, then you must cut away the shattered and damaged portion as I describe to you: shave the head of the wounded patient.
Expose the bone in any way that is convenient and according to the shape of the wound, considering the patient's comfort. If you encounter bleeding or hot swelling during the exposure, treat it accordingly.
Fill the wound with cloth soaked in a mixture of wine and rose oil, then gently clean it until the swelling subsides and you prevent further bleeding. Then proceed to scrape out the bone and remove it, which is done in one of two methods.
One method is to cut the bone with a delicate, thin-bladed knife, as shown here:" [An illustration of a slender knife follows this sentence.]
Then another clamp is used after this one, slightly wider in size, and its shape looks like this.
Then another clamp is also used, even wider than the second one, and it must be among several clamps of different sizes, some wider and some shorter, all with very sharp edges, and they should be made from Indian iron or good steel.
Be gentle when striking the clamp so as not to dislodge and harm the head; if the bone is strong and hard, you should drill around it before using the clamps with drills they call 'non-diving drills', so named because they do not penetrate deeply.
Because these drills do not go beyond the skull bone to what lies beneath; there is a rounded edge below the sharp tip, resembling a ring or small circle, which prevents it from penetrating and going beyond the thickness of the bone.
You should have a large number of these drills, each suitable for a specific bone thickness; this will provide you with a drill tip that is sharp and long or short according to the skull's thickness. Here are pictures of three types. The drills: large, medium, and small.
To drill around the broken bone, place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you feel that the bone has been penetrated; then move the drill to another spot, leaving a space between each hole equivalent to the thickness of a rod or similar.
Then, using the clamps, cut between each pair of holes; do this with as much care and gentleness as possible, as we said before, until you can remove the bone either by hand or with another tool designed for that purpose.
Like forceps and fine clamps, you should be very careful that the drill or scissors do not touch any of the peritoneum. Once you have perforated the bone and separated it from the peritoneum if it was attached to it, then you should proceed with stripping.
The roughness that remains in the bone is smoothed with another instrument similar to scissors, but it should be thinner and finer than the other scissors. If there are any small bones or fragments left, take them gently with the instruments you have.
Then you treat the wound afterwards with sutures and ointments, which will be mentioned later. As for the other aspect of the procedure, it is very simple and safe, as Galen has described and praised greatly. Here is his quote: First, you should start by exposing the bone at the site where the fracture is most severe and prominent. Once you have exposed that part, place the tip of this lenticular scissors underneath it. Here is its image:
The lenticular part of it should be smooth and not cut anything, while the sharp part on its sides running lengthwise as you see should allow the lenticular part to rest against the peritoneum with the scissors' sharp edge facing the bone. Then strike the scissors from one side only.
With a small hammer, you cut through all the bone gently as it turns. While doing this, you are safe from damaging the membrane; no terrifying accident can occur whatsoever, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant, cowardly, and drowsy person.
If anything remains attached to the bone from the membrane in some places, scrape it off with the edge of the lenticular scissors itself and remove it gently; for it will come away without any harm or fear.
If the bone fracture does not penetrate the membrane and only a small piece breaks off, leaving roughness and tiny fragments behind, then these should be scraped away and removed with fine chisels of varying sizes. These tools are necessary to ensure you can use the most suitable and effective one for each situation as it arises.
Depending on the shape of the broken bone, you should use the widest chisel first for scraping, then gradually move to narrower ones until you end up using the narrowest and thinnest one available.
For other minor hairline fractures and delicate breaks, each one should be treated according to its specific needs for healing. This is something that should not be a mystery to anyone with even basic experience in this practice, having read through what we have written about treating major bone fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, you should take a piece of linen cloth that fits over the wound and soak it in rose oil. Place this on top of the wound, then cover with another folded or triangular-shaped cloth. Dip this cloth in a rosewater solution and apply it over the first one, being as gentle as possible to avoid weighing down on the membrane. Then use a wide bandage that is not tied too tightly, only enough to hold the wound together.
Leave the wound like this for a day or two to prevent hot swelling, then remove it and start using medicines that have a drying effect, such as iris root, cereal flour, benzoin powder, guaiacum, and others similar to these. These should be used in powdered form.
Apply it to the wound while dry and, in general, use a remedy that cleanses without stinging; be diligent in ensuring your treatment of the wound is clean with no trace of grease nor filth and do not leave pus to gather there at all.
For pus, if it gathers on the membrane of the brain, corrupts and putrefies it; from this, there occurs a great calamity for the patient. It may appear in the lining of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if treatment is neglected.
If there is a blackening on its surface and the patient presents with the symptoms we have mentioned, then know that he is surely doomed to die; unless the blackening was caused by a remedy applied to it, and this remedy had the power to cause such blackening.
You should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well and use a cloth to apply this to the lining; then treat it with the appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the setting of a broken nose.
Know that only the upper parts of the nose can break, either one or both, since they are made of bone; the lower part is cartilage and cannot break but may suffer bruising, distortion, or a beak-like deformity.
If one side breaks, you should insert your little finger into the nostril and, with your thumb and index fingers from outside, realign that break internally until the nose is back in its natural shape; do this gently and be careful not to cause further pain.
If the break is at the top of the nose and the bone has not been displaced, it should be straightened with a rounded stick that is slightly thick. If the fracture is on both sides, do the same. And one must proceed to reset it on the first day of the break.
If not, then after the seventh or tenth day when the hot swelling has subsided, you should insert a wick of linen cloth into the nostril; if the fracture is on one side, insert one wick, and two wicks if it is on both sides.
The wicks should be of a thickness that fills the nostril, and some early surgeons have suggested wetting them with butter before replacing them every day. I do not think this is necessary; instead, they should be dipped in egg white mixed with flour.
You can then leave the wicks in place until the bone is stable and the cartilage has hardened. You may also insert tubes made from goose feathers, wrapped in soft cloth, into the nose where the wick was; this provides stronger support for the broken nose and allows the patient to breathe more easily.
This step is not essential, but you may do it if you wish; alternatively, you can use wicks. If there is any hot swelling during the process, apply a dressing to the nose made of a mixture of aloes and honey, or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or some ointment of diachylon.
If there is no hot swelling, the nose should be dressed from the outside with a mixture of fine semolina and frankincense powder kneaded into egg white. A soft cloth is then placed over this, but you must not tie anything around the nose at all. If the bones of the nose are broken in small pieces...
If the stone is broken or fragmented, it should be cut open and extracted using an appropriate instrument; then, the incision should be sutured and treated with ointments that promote healing and closure. If a wound occurs inside the nose, it must be treated with stitches and lead tubes. Until it heals.
Chapter four.
When the lower jaw is fractured.
If the lower jaw is broken but there is no accompanying wound, and if the break is external only, without splitting into two pieces, with the bone bending inward, then identifying it will be easier.
If the fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth; if it is on the left side, use the index finger of your right hand to gently lift the broken piece from inside towards the outside.
With your other hand outside the mouth, adjust and align the bone; if the jaw is broken into two pieces, you must use traction from both sides to realign it; if any teeth are affected, they will need treatment as well.
If teeth are displaced, attempt to realign them and secure them with a fine thread made of gold, silver or silk; then apply a layer of caustic ointment to the broken jaw, cover it with a cloth folded in two layers, and finally bind a large splint or a piece of leather cut from a shoe sole onto the cloth for added support. Secure the splint with a binding on top, as tightly as necessary to keep it in place and allow for comfort; instruct the patient to rest and avoid any movement; their diet should consist of soft porridge or gruel; if you suspect that anything is amiss, remove the bandage on the third day.
Secure the splint with a binding on top, as tightly as necessary to keep it in place and allow for comfort; instruct the patient to rest and avoid any movement; their diet should consist of soft porridge or gruel; if you suspect that anything is amiss, remove the bandage on the third day. First, treat the wound with flour from a millstone mixed with egg white or fine semolina after removing the splint, and apply a soft bandage; as long as that dressing adheres to it [the wound], and there is no change in the state of the bone, leave it be.
Do not remove it until the wound heals and the fracture strengthens; often this fracture will strengthen in three weeks, but if swelling occurs during that time, use what we mentioned repeatedly to soothe it until the swelling subsides.
If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, examine it; if there is a fragment or fragments of bone protruding from the wound, carefully extract those fragments using an appropriate instrument; if the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as much as you need to.
Then, once you have extracted those fragments and there are no more remaining, suture the mouth of the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the salves suitable for this purpose. Suture the wound until it heals.
Chapter five.
On the setting of a broken clavicle.
The clavicle most often breaks in front, at the end of the shoulder; its fracture occurs in one of three ways: either it breaks and splinters into two without producing fragments, which is the easiest to set; or...
Or, fragments are produced in the fracture, which is more difficult to set; or there is a wound accompanying the break. In the case of a fracture without a wound, you will need two servants: one to hold firm the humerus adjacent to the broken clavicle and another to extend the neck towards the other side.
Then smooth the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and there is neither prominence nor deformation. If you need to extend more, you should place beneath the patient's armpit a ball of rags or wool.
It should be of a length suitable for your needs; you extend and lift the clavicle, pressing the ball with your hand until the fracture is smoothed as it should be. If you are unable to pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it has become too deep, then the patient must lie on his back.
Place a moderate-sized pillow under his shoulder, and have the servant press down on his shoulder towards the floor until the clavicle which has sunk into the depth rises upwards; at that point, set the fracture right and smooth it with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken off and is moving, then it is necessary to make an incision over it and extract that fragment gently; if the fragment is embedded within bone, devise a means of cutting it with one of the instruments prepared for this purpose. Once the instrument which protects the pleura is situated beneath the clavicle, an instrument made of wood or iron; this is its image: [Image follows]
It resembles a spoon without a handle, its width according to the size of the bone which you require, large or small; and likewise its length for carrying out the operation - let it be double-ended as shown: one end broad and the other narrow.
If the wound which you opened to extract the bone fragment is wide and you are not concerned about hot swelling, then draw together the lips of the wound with sutures; but if the tear is slight or you fear hot swelling, pack the wound with rags and swabs according to the size of its gash.
If a hot tumor becomes inflamed, moisten the cloth with rose oil and vinegar or wine, and apply it. However, if binding a bone without an incision or wound, use a dressing made of millstone dust mixed with egg white. Apply a soft pad, then place a pillow under their armpit if needed. Take a very long turban, about one span wide, and fold it. Place a folded padding on top of the pad and dressing, then get a splint made from thin wooden board. It should be three fingers wide and of equal length, then wrap it in a cloth. Include this cloth with the splint into the part of the turban that covers the fracture site, then tighten the turban around the break as you would normally. Place it on their neck, under their healthy armpit, and also the affected side. Roll it back and forth multiple times to each side as you see fit to ensure a firm fix for the fracture.
The key point is that the splint must not move from over the broken bone. For this reason, you should check the patient daily. Whenever the bandage loosens and you see the splint has moved, fix it and tighten the bandage again. Ensure they sleep on their back with a small pillow under their armpit at night.
This will lift their shoulder and with it the clavicle fracture, or alternatively you can tie their arm to their neck. Do not remove the bandage unless there is an issue such as itching or swelling at the site before 12 days have passed.
Then renew the bandage if you see cause for it. After which, tighten the splint and leave it until the clavicle fracture unites and consolidates, this will take around twenty-eight days and is stronger then before. It may be less in some people.
Chapter Six.
Shoulder fractures are rare in the wider part of the bone, but they can occur at its edges; however, if a fracture occurs anywhere on it or through its middle this can be determined by feeling for it and depending on how the fracture is shaped, proceed as follows...
Smooth and realign it as naturally as you can with whatever means are available to you, then apply millstone dust mixed with egg white and soft lint, placing over this a pad of folded cloth then applying a wide splint made from a board.
If the splint is narrower than the shoulder or slightly wider, then if there are any uneven places on the shoulder, smooth these with soft lint until the splint fits evenly; then secure it tightly from above with a long bandage.
Secure it firmly and check the splint is in place so as not to be dislodged, then each day examine the bandage; whenever it loosens tighten it up and re-align the splint if it has become displaced, ensuring the patient lies on their healthy side while the shoulder heals within twenty days.
Within a day or twenty-five days, once this period has passed remove the bandage with confidence as it is one of those bones that heal well and will not be likely to re-fracture; if there are any splinters piercing through then make an incision over these and extract them. Do what I have mentioned for treating clavicle fractures with hot swelling if any of that occurs.
Chapter 7.
On setting fractures of the ribs.
The chest may break in the middle, and it is rarely affected by this; however, its edges are more likely to fracture and splinter. If the middle of the chest breaks, one can experience a downward tilt, severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
Perhaps blood is coughed up, and the depression in the broken bone can be felt; it cannot escape detection. To set this fracture, have the patient lie on their back with a pillow between their shoulders. Then compress their shoulder blades together while gathering the ribs by hand from both sides, being as gentle as possible when aligning them.
Do this until the shape of the bone returns to normal, then bind it with bandages and splint it using a light board made from willow or heather wrapped in a cloth. Then be gentle when tying the splint to the broken bone so it doesn't come off. Wrap the bandage around in circles towards the back several times, securing it tightly. Check on the bandage often and retighten whenever necessary.
If it needs to be removed due to local inflammation, pain, or swelling, do so promptly by loosening the bandage and removing the splint. Treat any issues that arise with appropriate remedies, then reapply the bandage if you deem it necessary. Face the patient and tighten the bandage until healing is complete.
Chapter Eight.
In the setting of ribs, when they are broken, know that the ribs fracture in the thicker parts next to the back and their ends from the front; this is because they are cartilaginous. The recognition of this fact will not escape the senses during inspection with the fingers.
And its setting [of ribs] is by smoothing the fracture with the fingers in a capable manner until the shape becomes even as it should be, then it is bandaged and the broken bone is tightly bound with a splint if necessary. If the rib fractures are tilted inward, severe pain will present to the patient.
And puncturing, like the puncturing that occurs in one with a thorn, is due to the bone piercing the diaphragm; it also presents shortness of breath, coughing, and expulsion of much blood - this condition [is] difficult to treat. The Ancients have devised many stratagems for it.
One of them said that the patient's diet should include foods which generate flatulence and wind, so that the abdomen becomes distended and expanded, pushing the fracture outwards. We dislike this lest it confirms the occurrence of a hot swelling, if it has not yet occurred; for if it has already happened then it will increase it and confirm [the swelling].
Another said that a cupping glass should be placed on the spot and then strongly pulled, which is more analogous to reasoning; however, it is feared that the cupping glass may draw pus to the weakened site. Another said that the area should be covered with wool which has been dipped in hot oil.
A compress is then applied between the ribs until it becomes full, so that when you wrap the bandage around in a circle, it remains level. Then treat the patient with treatment for a thorn, through diet and medication. If the patient suffers an arduous condition which they cannot bear... And if the bone pierces the diaphragm causing severe pain, and we fear for the patient's health, then it is necessary to make an incision over this area and expose the broken rib. We should place beneath it the instrument that protects the peritoneum, as previously described, and cut away the bone carefully before removing it.
We then bring together the lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures and treat it with ointments until it heals. If during this time a hot tumor appears, immediately apply dressings moistened with rose oil to the affected area and treat the patient internally with medications that reduce swelling.
The patient should lie on the side where sleep is more comfortable until healing is complete.
Chapter 9.
On setting fractures of the vertebrae in the back and neck.
Regarding the bones of the neck, if they are affected by a fracture (which is rare), and more commonly by bruising; so too with the vertebrae in the back - if this occurs to someone, and you want to know whether or not they will heal... Look to see if the patient's hands have relaxed and gone numb, and are lifeless; they cannot move them, nor open or close their fists; if you pinch or prick them with a needle, they feel nothing and experience no pain - then know that in most cases they will not heal and thus are doomed.
If they can move their hands and feel when pinched or pricked, then know that the spinal marrow is intact and with treatment, the patient will heal; if the vertebrae in the back are affected likewise, and you want to determine whether or not healing is possible...
Look at his legs; if you see that they have relaxed and the same has happened as with the hands, then when he lies on his back wind and feces are passed involuntarily, and when he is laid on his belly urine is discharged without volition. When he is laid on his back and wants to urinate, he cannot do so; know that he will die, so do not bother with his treatment. If none of these things happens to him, the condition is less severe. To treat what has occurred, you should aim to reduce the hot swelling.
Apply rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks, to the affected vertebrae; do this three times a day until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply one of the strengthening dressings and bind it tightly in place, advising him to remain still and quiet.
He should not sleep on the side that causes pain, but only on that which does not, until he is healed. If a splinter or some other piece of bone has broken off within the injury and has healed over, then you must cut open the skin and extract it. If the wound is large, bring its lips together with stitches; then treat it with emollient salves until healing occurs. If the lowest bone of the coccyx—the tailbone—is broken, you should insert your left thumb into the anus.
Even out the broken bone with your other hand as best you can, then apply a dressing and splint if needed, binding it tightly.
If you feel a splinter of bone within it, cut open the skin and remove it; treat the wound as previously described until healing occurs.
Chapter ten.
In the setting of fractures to the hip joint.
Fractures of the hip joint rarely occur, but when they do happen, it is usually in one or more pieces at its end and along its length; this fractures tilts towards the inside, causing severe pain to the patient on the site itself with stabbing pains and numbness down into the leg where fracture has occurred.
To set the bone, you must first pass your hand over it to determine what type of fracture exists and how exactly it looks; if the fracture is only at its ends then simply realign the pieces according to the natural shape as seems appropriate to you.
If the fracture is along its length, or if it has tilted towards the inside then you must lay the patient on their stomach so that you can realign this fracture; once it's set and in place, bind it with a bandage then attach splint of wood or leather tightly to hold it firmly.
Do not fear if the fracture shifts or splint loosens; correct any concavity with pads to fill this out and make it even, then wrap tightly so it stays in place; tell your patient they must sleep on their back or side for some time; should hot swelling arise.
Cease manipulation and setting the fracture until hot swelling has subsided; treat it as before, then return to set the bone and wrap it tightly again according to need; if bone fragments or pieces exist from its ends do not remove them.
Do not disturb it, but correct it from the outside as already said; leave it tightly wrapped until healed.
Chapter eleven.
Repair of the humerus fracture.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder joint. If it is fractured, its repair is done in one of two ways. One method is to use a smooth, curved rod of medium thickness that looks like this: [image showing a curved rod].
You tie two ligaments to its ends, then hang it from a high point and have the patient sit on a chair. Next, you place their broken arm onto the rod such that their armpit is attached at the middle of the curve of the rod. Then, you suspend something heavy above them.
Alternatively, an assistant can stretch it downwards while the physician uses both hands to align the fracture and put the pieces back where they belong. Another option is for the patient to lie on their back with their hand suspended from their neck using a ligament.
Then, you instruct two assistants to adjust the pieces of the fracture: one above it and another below it. Each assistant then pulls in their direction while keeping the pieces aligned. If you want more tension, tie a ligament under the fracture and another over it; each assistant will pull on these ligaments in opposite directions.
If the fracture is close to the shoulder joint, the ligament should go under the armpit with the other one going under the fracture towards the elbow. Similarly, if it's closer to the elbow then each of the ligaments will be placed on that spot and also at the elbow itself.
You then gently align the fracture without force until it is properly aligned and has healed well enough to bear tension. If there's no hot swelling, you can apply tension but if so, leave the tensioning till day seven. Instead, put a wool pad soaked in vinegar and rose oil on it.
When the swelling has subsided, then apply traction. To do this, place a bandage over the fracture and cover it with a swathe of fresh cloth. Then gather the arm onto the upper arm itself and put his hand open on his shoulder.
Cover the cloth and apply traction to both upper arm and forearm, letting the arm act as a splint if there are no contraindications or any changes in the broken bone; if you fear that this might cause problems, use splints.
The technique is to place a splint directly on the fracture, which should be wider and stronger than the others; leave the width of a finger between each splint, and their length should correspond to the fracture plus three fingers' width on either side.
Then apply traction to the splints as described in the first chapter.
That is, you should pull more strongly on the site of the fracture.
The further the fracture is from its original position, the less you should pull; if at any point during reduction of the limb you feel that applying splints and traction as we have described would be appropriate, then do so.
If you fear the development of erysipelas, do not apply traction or splints until the seventh day as we have said; check the bandage every three days in order to prevent itching, oedema, or ischaemia due to excessive tension and correct them according to what we have described.
If you are confident that none of the aforementioned problems will occur, do not remove the bandage for many days; have the patient lie on his back with his hand resting on his stomach and place a moderate amount of wool under their upper arm.
Examine it frequently, day or night, to ensure the broken limb maintains its shape and that the bandage does not loosen. Rectify any such issues with diligence, and adjust the patient's diet according to the guidelines previously outlined; let their food be light at first until the bone begins to heal.
Their diet should then be made more substantial, for it is common that the arm and leg take forty days to heal; at this point, remove the bandage, have them use a bath, and treat with ointments suited to this purpose; if the fracture is severe and bruised.
Do not remove the bandage until fifty days or two months have passed.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of arm fractures.
The arm comprises two bones, known as the radius and ulna; one is smaller and located near the thumb, while the other is larger and sits beneath it. Either bone may break independently or together.
When the upper, smaller bone is fractured, it heals easily and quickly; however, a break in the lower bone is more severe and takes longer to mend. The worst scenario occurs when both bones are broken simultaneously. If only the upper, smaller bone is affected,
The physician, when setting the fracture, should gently extend it to align it; if the larger bone is affected, more force may be required during extension. When both bones are broken, a much greater degree of force will be necessary.
The hand should be placed in a specific position during its setting and extension, lying flat on a pillow with the thumb elevated above all other fingers; likewise, the little finger ought to sit below all others, while the patient sits cross-legged.
The pillow should be placed at an appropriate height so as not to cause the patient any unnecessary discomfort.
An assistant should then extend the arm from below, either with their hand or a bandage; another assistant extends it further from above. The physician manipulates and realigns the bone to restore its shape as best they can. If there are any splinters in the fracture, they may form calluses.
Ensure each splinter is returned to its proper place, so far as you are able; if one appears to be protruding and piercing the skin, but it cannot be realigned, make an incision nearby and extract it using the method previously described. In cases of fracture with laceration, this has been given a dedicated chapter.
Then, refer to that chapter for appropriate treatment guidance; if an acute inflammation occurs during the initial setting of a fracture, take some qirotti ointment made with rose oil and white wax—of moderate thickness—spread it onto a cloth and gently bind this over the affected area until the swelling subsides.
Remove the qirotti and apply a dressing made from millflower powder mixed with egg white, then replace the splints; be aware that the one placed over the fracture itself should be slightly wider and stronger. Note also that the number of splints required for an arm will typically total six.
If the fracture is in one or both of the ulnae, ensure that you bind this area more firmly and tightly than elsewhere; as before, make the binding looser as you move up and down the limb from this point.
Let the bandages that wrap around the fracture be soft and moist, not too hard or stiff. The thread used to bind it should be made of linen, especially a kind which is moderately thin yet sturdy as described; inspect both the limb and the binding after some days.
If there is an issue that needs to be addressed, such as itching in the affected area, the limb should be bathed with warm water until the itching subsides. Leave the limb untightened for a night so it can rest, then resume binding.
If the binding has loosened and the bone has shifted or something similar, fix all of that to the best of your ability. Also, check if food is unable to reach the limb due to excessive tightness; in such a case, loosen it slightly and leave it for some days until nourishment can be resumed, then bind it again.
If the patient experiences none of what has been mentioned, the binding should not be removed for about twenty days or so. Then, suspend the patient's arm from their neck and ensure that it is level; they must try to avoid any sudden movements as much as possible and sleep on their back.
Know that this type of fracture in the arm usually heals within thirty or thirty-two days, but it can sometimes take as few as twenty-eight days; all of these are dependent on factors such as temperament and overall strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On treating fractures of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpals of the hand and phalanges of the fingers are rarely subject to fracture but often sustain bruises; if either the palm or these bones have sustained a fracture or bruising,
The patient should sit cross-legged with a chair placed evenly in front of him.
Then he should place his hand on it, stretched out; next the bone-setter extends and aligns the broken bones, which the physician then brings into good alignment. When this has been achieved, if no hot swelling ensues, the bandage and splint should be applied, followed by a splint above as required.
Having inserted it into a soft cloth, if the fracture is directed downwards towards the palm, make something like a ball out of a cloth and instruct the patient to grip it with his broken hand; then bind it firmly with a long cloth.
The splint should be made of leather with some give in it so that the skin conforms to the flexure of the entire hand, and bind it as required; if the fracture is directed outwards, a splint must be placed above and another below at the wrist, so that the hand remains open and extended.
Then bind as the hand rotates, and secure between the fingers with a band; if the fracture involves one of the phalanges of the fingers, if it is the thumb then align it properly and bind it together with the hand; you may also apply a small splint to hold it in place.
And ensure that it does not move; if the fracture involves any of the other fingers, such as the index finger or little finger, align and bind them to the healthy finger next to them, or bind all of them together—this is better still; or apply a small upright splint over them.
As stated before regarding the thumb, check frequently during and after setting for hot swelling; if this occurs, treat it as described previously.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the setting of fractures of the femur.
The femur is frequently fractured, and it can be felt because it moves forwards and backwards. Its reduction is by a ligature above the fracture and another below it; the patient lies on his face.
Then each assistant extends his ligature in a straight line, like this if the fracture is in the middle of the bone; but if it is near the hip joint, a soft ligature must be tied, either of wool or similar material.
If it is at the hip-joint towards the pubis, a ligature must be tied above that spot to draw upwards, and another below the fracture; likewise if it is near the knee, let the ligature be near the knee so as to allow drawing downwards. Then the physician reduces the bone with both hands until he restores it to its natural shape.
The bone then unites well; now the bandaging and pressure should be applied, unless there is no hot swelling of the limb, but if such exists, leave it alone for a few days until the acute swelling subsides, then resume treatment.
As for the bandaging, a hard, wide turban must be wrapped twice or thrice around the fracture leaving some slack; then turn the leg so that the heel is at the hip-joint and pass a long thread between thigh and leg below knee level, bringing its ends out above on either side.
Then twist what remains of the turban around leg and thigh; now place splints on the thigh at the fracture site, tying them into one splint over the shin bone. Fill any remaining gap between thigh and leg with soft rags to achieve equal tension.
Then begin with a strong pull from the middle to the fracture site, with three or four wraps. The further away you move the bandage from the fracture site, let your pull be less strong and gentle.
Then take the ends of the thread that you had passed between the thigh and leg, tie them to the splint that is above it. Then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the calf of the leg, then also pull on the end of the splints from the other side.
To ensure that the bandage does not shift from its place, then leave it untightened until there is no more pain or swelling in the limb nor any further damage and so on. If any of these occur, then act quickly to loosen it, repairing whatever has happened, following what we have mentioned multiple times.
If there is a shard in the bone that pierces, then you should smooth it out if possible; otherwise, cut into it and pull it out. Treat the wound as mentioned earlier until it heals. Sometimes this fracture of the thigh can be immobilized without adding any splints to the leg.
As mentioned earlier regarding the upper arm and forearm, with this approach there is no risk of limping for the patient. However, if you immobilize only the thigh without adding splints to the leg, then the patient will always limp.
Note that the thigh takes around fifty days to heal, or slightly more or less depending on individual constitutions and other circumstances.
Chapter 15.
On the fracture of the knee cap.
The knee joint is rarely susceptible to fracture, but often prone to bruising. If a fracture does occur, it can be either a split or a shattering of its components and this may happen with or without an accompanying wound.
You detect all this by touch, and mend the fracture by realigning separated parts with your fingers until they join together as best you can, gently and carefully. Then support it in a bandage and if necessary apply a circular splint.
Then draw the surrounding muscles taught, before monitoring all of the symptoms we have described for other fractures such as hot swelling and so on, treating each symptom appropriately until healing is complete.
Chapter Sixteen.
On setting the fracture of the leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick and called the tibia, and another thin named the fibula; their fracture types are similar to those of the humerus and radius. Therefore its setting is the same as for the arm, using the same techniques. If both bones are broken then the leg will be displaced in all directions; if only the thinner bone is fractured it dislocates forward; while a fracture of the thicker bone from below can also be treated by these methods.
Use traction and realignment as appropriate, splinting with bandages accordingly; if the tibia is badly broken into many fragments, use less traction and apply it more gently.
An additional step when treating the leg is to obtain two pine splints, such as those used for floor-boarding, or else use palm leaves or similar.
Choose those that are slightly thick and not from the thinnest hides, and let their length be equal to the length of the leg, from the knee down. Then wrap each one with a cloth, twice around its length, placing one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let it be from the knee to the bottom of the foot, then tie the two pieces at three places on both ends and in the middle. With this strap, the leg is prevented from leaning right or left and is properly trained. A wooden gutter can also be used along the length of the leg.
It is placed therein to keep it from moving, and this should be done especially in the case of a fracture with an accompanying wound. Inspect the leg daily and watch for swelling, inflammation, or any other such issues. Whenever any such issue occurs, treat it accordingly until it heals. The leg bone takes about thirty days or so to heal.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the fracture of leg bones and toes.
The heel is never subject to fracture, but the leg bones can be fractured. Toes are also rarely fractured; in most cases, they are merely bruised.
If the leg bones are fractured and you see that they are protruding from one another, let the patient place their foot on the ground, as if walking upright. Then, stand up yourself and put your foot on top of the raised bone ends, pressing them down to even them out.
Thus, they are returned to their places. Then take up the bandages and splint and place them underneath; put a small wooden board with flat ends under the sole of the foot. Bind the foot firmly after wrapping it in cloth and doing whatever else is necessary.
If it has been three or four days, release the bandage; you will find that the bones are aligned as if they were broken or dislocated. The procedure is evident. But if some of the fingers are broken, set and align them according to what I have described for setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken finger, running along its length and being slightly wider than it. Place beneath the foot this board that I described to you and secure it tightly. If more than one bone is broken, such as two or three or more.
Make a splint for each finger according to its size, wrapped in a soft cloth. Secure the board beneath the foot, ensuring that each end of the board extends beyond the sole of the foot to provide proper alignment.
You must remember to regularly monitor all the symptoms we have mentioned for various fractures and address each symptom as it arises.
Chapter 18.
On the fracture of the woman's pubic bone and the man's penis.
If a woman's pubic bone is broken, have her sit in a squatting position and then gently bend her toward the back slightly. Have the midwife grasp her from behind and pack her genital area with cotton until it is full and forms a ball-like shape within her.
The woman should then be gently shaken and her hips slightly elevated, which will cause the cotton to come out until it forms a ball-like shape at the opening of her genital area, reducing the fracture of the bone. Then apply a poultice to her back. Whenever she needs to urinate, the cotton can be carefully removed so that she may do so.
Return it to its original position, then go back to the first support; do this for seven days or so and it will heal. If you wish, take a sheep's bladder, attach a tube made of reed to its mouth, and insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then blow into the tube with force so that the bladder inflates inside her vagina, and the fracture will be reduced. Then pack it with cotton and keep him/her immobile for a few days as described until healing occurs. If the pubic bone is fractured in either men or women, this [treatment] can be used to set it.
Level it as described for the hip bone fracture. You should not have any trouble with these unusual fractures, which are rare and especially so in those who have some experience [in treating them]. This is particularly true if you understand this book of mine well because more often than not the fracture itself will guide you.
Regarding a man with a fractured thigh, take the windpipe of a goose and insert it into his urethra; then wrap this in cloth, bandage it, and leave him for three days or so until he heals.
Chapter 19.
On setting bone fractures if accompanied by wounds.
One should bleed immediately anyone who presents with a fracture and a wound, especially if the bone involved is large such as the femur or humerus, provided that the conditions for bloodletting are met, as previously described.
If the wound is bleeding, one should proceed to cauterize it by applying powdered zinc sulfate (white vitriol) if nothing else is available; then set the fracture on that very day and do not delay.
If no hot swelling occurs, but if a hot swelling does occur, leave its healing until the ninth day so that the hot swelling subsides. Do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for it will be exposed to bad symptoms.
If the broken bone protrudes on the skin, exposed, then you should attempt to push it back and align it gently with your hands, stretching a little. If this is not possible for you to do by hand, then push it back with this tool, which is an iron device about seven or eight fingers in length. And its width should be according to the size of the wound.
Therefore, the physician should have three or four of these tools ready, according to what is needed for treatment in each type of fracture. Let them be round, with a bit of thickness so that they do not bend when pressed during use.
They should have a sharp end with a curve at the tip, and be thicker towards the top, while from the middle to the bottom they are very thin. This is its image:
This is called 'perem' in Greek, which means a small lever. You should place its sharp curved end on the tip of the protruding bone and push it back with one movement until the bone returns to its position and is somewhat aligned. Then smooth out the alignment of the broken ends against each other.
If the broken end is thin and the tool does not take it well, you should cut off that end of the bone so that the tool can grasp it properly. If you still cannot push back the bone using the methods we described, then cut it with a similar type of cutting device as those mentioned earlier.
Publish it with one of the leaflets as best you can, then strip away what remains in the bone of roughness and thin scales; if, upon replacing the bone, the patient finds after its replacement severe pain which is harmful, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to restore it to its natural position, do so; for by this means you will greatly benefit the patient. When your setting of the bone is complete, dip a cloth in black astringent wine and apply it especially if it be summer time but avoid tar or anything oily on the wound.
lest putrefaction and corruption should occur, then use splints when you have finished setting the bone; leave the wound exposed by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors to fit over the wound.
Take utmost care not to bandage the wound with the broken bone, for often unskilled physicians have done this and brought about in their patients either death or gangrene or a flux; let your bandaging be gentle and relaxed, differing from that of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or a large one and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and the patient experiences disturbing pain at the site, then it is not appropriate to use splints; make for him bandages with stiff cloths in place of the splints, and bind them on.
When, after a day or two, you see pus forming in the wound, remove from it the cloth which has been treated with wine and use dressings and ointments which we customarily employ for treating wounds such as the four-herb ointment and its like; you should also loosen the bandages.
You should inspect the wound every evening and morning until it heals, and you must position the limb so that pus can drain downward easily. If several days pass without healing or any lessening of discharge, then know there are small bone fragments present.
You should probe the wound with a probe; remove any fragments that are exposed, and those which penetrate the limb causing pain must be cut away and extracted by whatever means possible.
If any form of corruption, ulceration or putrefaction affects the wound then you must treat it according to its type as described in other sections.
You must remember, if a large bone is broken and protrudes from the limb like the femur or humerus then you should not attempt to pull it out. This often results in death so leave it alone until the bone putrefies; sometimes, after twenty or thirty days have passed it will drop out of its own accord.
Then treat the wound if it seems possible, otherwise leave it alone.
Chapter Twenty.
On the treatment of complications arising from some fractures.
This complication often arises after the fracture has healed, especially near joints; it can disfigure the limb and may prevent its natural function.
If the complication is still soft, treat it with astringent medications such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, galbanum and acacia gum by mixing some or all of these together in an astringent drink, egg whites or vinegar.
Take it and twist it into a knot with difficulty, pulling it tightly and leaving the bandage on for many days without loosening it. Then loosen it and repeat this process until the swelling is reduced if God wills it. Or you may use a well-fitted lead plate instead of a bandage.
Lead has a property that can remove all swelling in the body parts. If the swelling has hardened and become severe, and there is an urgent need to remove it, then cut into it from above and cut off any protruding excess or strip it away with some scalpels until it is gone. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On treating fractures after they have healed but the limb remains thin and weak compared to its original state.
When a bone fracture heals but the limb remains thin and weak, this may be due to many reasons. One of the reasons is either due to repeatedly loosening and re-applying bandages incorrectly, or because the bandages are too tight, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb. It could also be caused by excessive cleaning, inappropriate movements at the wrong time, or a lack of blood and weakness in the patient's body.
To address this issue, the patient should be nourished and their body enriched to increase blood flow. The use of baths, creating a cheerful and joyful atmosphere, and applying pitch (a type of tar) to the affected limb to attract nourishment are recommended treatments. Alternatively, the limb can be regularly cleaned with warm water. Until nourishment flows into it again, allowing the limb to return to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
In the treatment of broken bones if they unite crookedly and prevent proper movement.
Whenever there appears in a member which has been healed after breaking, a deformation or swelling of the broken bone, and because of this, the appearance of that member is unsightly. Unless the member is not prevented from performing its natural function, it should not be accepted what some claim that the broken bone must be re-broken at the head, for many ignorant physicians and bonesetters used to do this in our country.
This action is greatly condemned, leading to grave danger; its least consequence being paralysis. But if the deformation and complication are still soft then it should be treated with water in which herbs that soften have been boiled such as marshmallow leaves and roots, rosemary, lavender, etc..
The member should be bandaged with softening dressings such as diachylon well-prepared, or the root of marshmallow mixed with chicken fat and sesame oil may be applied; or thick figs may be crushed with pigeon droppings and other medicines known to break adhesions.
The complication may resolve by continual gentle massaging with hands, and the movement of the member in all directions at all times; but if the deformation is old, severe and hardened, then it must be treated with iron.
A length of iron should be inserted above it, and the broken bone must be gently tapped until its contact is released and what remains of the complication or the excess bone is cut away with fine instruments; care and effort being taken throughout. Then treat the wound as previously described until healed.
Chapter Twenty-three.
The jaw is a joint that has dislocated from its position, hindering movement and causing deformity of the member as well as severe pain for the patient; therefore, when a jaw fracture occurs, it should be treated immediately by restoring its proper position.
Treatment should not be delayed, as any delay will result in swelling of the affected area, making jaw reduction difficult; therefore, it is important not to delay treatment and to avoid moving or stretching during the period of swelling, as this often causes painful muscle spasms for the patient.
If this occurs, the patient should be bled immediately and then left until the swelling subsides slightly; thereafter, the affected member is immersed in hot water and oil before being restored to its proper position gently. Each member should then be treated as described at its respective location.
The chapters on jaw fractures have also been arranged in order, starting from the top of the body down to the bottom, according to the classification of bone fractures previously described.
Chapter Twenty-four.
On the treatment of lower jaw fractures.
Jaw dislocations are rare; they occur in two ways, either a slight displacement of the jaws from their positions or a complete dislocation with extensive relaxation. In the case of a complete dislocation, saliva may pour from the patient's mouth; they will be unable to control it and struggle to close their jaw, with their tongue also affected in speech. In most cases, a slight displacement can self-correct easily without treatment.
If the dislocation is complete, it should be reduced immediately and without delay; a servant holds the patient's head while the physician places their thumb in the joint of the jaw inside the mouth if the dislocation is on one side.
Or they can place both thumbs in the joint if it is on both sides, and with their other fingers outside, adjust and align them; the physician then tells the patient to relax their jaw and move it in all directions while they realign and manipulate the jaw back into its socket.
If reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, apply hot compresses and oil to ease the process; do not delay in reducing them as we mentioned earlier. Once they are back in place and the patient's mouth can close without tension, then use lint bandages with a cerate made of wax and rose oil.
Secure it gently with loose bandages; the patient should sleep on their back, their head supported between two pillows to prevent any movement or turning of the head right or left. They must avoid chewing anything and consume a soft liquid diet instead.
Once the pain subsides and the jaw is stable, they may eat as desired; however, this should be done gently without straining to open their mouth when eating, drinking or yawning until the jaw is fully healed.
If it is difficult to reduce both jaws when they dislocate and do not return to their normal position, this often leads to fevers, persistent headaches, abdominal discomfort and frequent vomiting of bile. If you observe these symptoms, know that the jaw is severely damaged.
Many times, patients with this condition die within ten days.
Chapter 25.
Regarding the reduction of the clavicle and shoulder joint dislocation.
As for the clavicle, it dislocates towards the inside due to its connection with the chest, and sometimes it can dislocate outwardly as well, which is apparent through touch. To reduce it, the patient should lie on their back and extend their arms.
Then you should press the area firmly with your palm, and it will go back into place. Afterwards, bandage it with dressings and support pads to secure it in place. The end of the clavicle near the shoulder rarely dislocates; however, if it does, it needs to be reduced using the method we've described or any other technique that works for you.
After that, apply bandages with support pads and tighten them in place. Advise the patient to rest and remain still until they recover. Using this same treatment, you can also reduce shoulder dislocation if it occurs as well.
Chapter 26.
Regarding the reduction of shoulder dislocation.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: first, towards the armpit and downward; second, towards the chest; third, upwards over the shoulder, which is rare.
It does not dislocate towards the back due to the presence of the shoulder blade, nor forward because of the nerve in that area. The most common dislocation is downward toward the armpit, especially in those with less body fat as it happens quickly and can be easily reduced.
As for those with ample flesh, it is the opposite, meaning that [the instrument] enters and exits with difficulty. Sometimes, due to a blow or fall, the shoulder becomes swollen with a hot swelling, which is thought to be dislocated; in such cases, one should examine this carefully until ascertaining its veracity.
Then, proceed with the treatment accordingly. To identify the dislocation, compare the affected shoulder with its healthy counterpart; you will notice an obvious difference between them and find that the head of the affected joint is indented while palpating below the armpit feels like grasping an egg.
The patient will not be able to lift their hand to their ear nor move it in all directions; likewise, if the joint is dislocated towards the chest or upwards, this will also be apparent upon palpation and not hidden.
This joint can be easily reduced if it is soft or the patient is a child. To reduce it, have an assistant lift their arm upwards; then place your thumbs underneath their armpit and forcefully elevate the joint back into position while the assistant lifts and extends their arm upward.
The joint will quickly return to its position. However, if it does not reduce with the aforementioned method and the dislocation has been present for several days, the patient should bathe in warm water and use a poultice that relaxes and softens the tissues; such as one made from the roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and crown imperial cooked in water.
The patient should then lie on their back with a woolen pad of moderate firmness placed underneath their armpit; the physician places their heel atop the pad and grasps the patient's hand, extending it downward.
He pushes the ball with his foot, then he returns to a standing position. If you wish, you can return him to this position by having an attendant who is taller than the patient stand on the affected side and place their shoulder under the patient's armpit, lifting it upwards so that the patient is suspended in mid-air. Another attendant pulls the patient's hand towards their lower abdomen, and if they are light in weight something else should be added to increase their weight; it will then return the jaw to its place immediately, or you can also bring them back in another manner.
You place a long stick in the ground, with its head rounded like a pestle but not too thick nor too thin; then you position it under the patient's armpit after placing soft cloth on top of the stick's head, and have the patient stand along the length of this wooden pole.
You stretch their hand down to the other side, and also extend their body forcefully from that same direction; then the joint will return swiftly to its place. If it is difficult to bring it back with all of the methods mentioned, you can use this treatment instead: Take a wooden rod about two arms' lengths long. With its width being the span of four fingers, and thickness that of two; it has a rounded head for easy insertion into the armpit, as such: [image follows]
Then you attach soft cloth to the rounded head so that the stick does not hurt the patient; it is placed under their armpit with hand and arm fully extended along its length, then secure the stick onto upper arm, forearm, and fingertips.
The arm is placed on a bar of ladder laid horizontally, then the hand stretched down while their body remains suspended from the other direction; this will bring the joint back into place. Once it's returned in any way possible, you should put under their armpit a woollen ball of moderate size.
Then apply the dressing, prepared from flour dust with frankincense and egg white, to the entire shoulder as it rotates above; then pull the ball tightly underneath the armpit and fasten it securely by bandaging over the dressing from above and suspend his arm around his neck.
He should remain motionless for seven days, and the patient's diet ought to be limited so that the affected limb can gain strength, which will accelerate its healing; then after seven or five days the dressing is removed and the patient exercised in movement. If no slackening occurs and it remains firm, he has been cured.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to moisture or some other cause, cauterization with three plates should be used as described in the chapter on cautery; if you perform all this and remove the bandage after seven days but the joint is still unstable...
If you reapply the dressing and tighten it repeatedly but it still falls apart, slacking off and not rising to its place, know that the nerve in the shoulder's head has either snapped or stretched out of shape; at this point acknowledge that the joint can never be secured.
As for the jaw towards the chest, breast and back: push it back with your hands to reposition it; all other methods of treatment should be used until healing occurs; if after recovery there is still stiffness in the limb and sluggishness in movement...
The patient should take many baths to make that stiffness soft again and restore it to its former state.
Chapter 27.
On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also reduces with difficulty; it dislocates in all directions, especially forwards or backwards. Its dislocation is not hidden from you since it occurs under the eyes and beneath your touch regardless of how it has been dislocated.
When you compare the dislocated elbow to a sound one, it becomes apparent from the depression of the joint; the arm is unable to bend and cannot reach the shoulder. You should act swiftly and reduce the dislocation at once before any hot swelling occurs.
If hot swelling occurs, it becomes difficult to reduce and may not recover at all; especially if the dislocation is backward as it is the worst type of dislocation and causes the most pain, often leading to death.
If reduction is possible, the assistant should extend both hands and arms; the physician's hands are placed above and below the elbow joint, pushing with their thumbs or the base of their palms until it returns to its place.
If the dislocation is forward, it may be reduced by quickly bending the hand so that the base of the palm strikes against the adjacent shoulder; if reduction does not occur, use a very strong and severe method which requires two assistants to extend the arm.
Two assistants also hold the patient to prevent displacement during extension; then, the arm is turned in all directions after wrapping it with a folded piece of cloth or a wide bandage around their hand. If the physician touches the joint with his hands, he should rub them with oil so that it can help facilitate the sliding movement of the joint.
Then the joint is pushed back with great force until it returns to its place, and after returning one should apply a bandage with compression and drying properties along with egg whites, tightening securely. The arm is then suspended from the patient's neck and left for several days.
Then release the bandage, and if the joint remains in place then untie it and leave it be. If you find that the joint is not strong enough, reapply both the dressing and the strapping and also leave them for several days until [the joint] gains strength; after this, undo them again. If any swelling should occur once the joint has returned to its position and been released,
If there is difficulty in movement then use moistening and gentle massage and manipulation until [the joint] softens, or place a leg of mutton on the joint and bandage it securely; leave this for one day and night before removing it and taking them into a bathhouse. After they have sweated, gently massage the joint.
Then return the mutton leg to the joint once, twice and three times along with baths until [the joint] softens; if you wish instead to use moist cow manure that has been lightened along with butterfat and bandage it in place then do so several times for this will soften [the joint] and restore its original condition.
Chapter 28
On the treatment of dislocated wrist joints.
The wrist joint is often dislocated, and its reduction is easy compared to other joints; however, it should be reduced promptly on the same day as the dislocation occurs before any hardening or hot swelling appears in that area.
Return his jaw by placing the patient's wrist on a board, extend the servant's hand, and place the doctor's palm on the joint protuberance, pushing it back until it goes except that you must check if the jaw has moved to the inside of the hand.
Let the patient place the back of their hand on the board when extending and returning it. If the jaw is protruding towards the back of the hand, let them put their palm-side hand on the board so that the doctor's hand rests on the same joint protuberance. If it returns immediately, then good; otherwise, bind it with a compress to ease swelling.
Leave it be, and do not attempt to correct it again, for it cannot bear further attempts, nor will you be able to push it back after a few days pass by. However, the joint will remain crooked without causing any harm to the patient unless the hand becomes slack and unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve has been severed or severely bruised, and there is no remedy but to bind it with cautery; perhaps it may help, or maybe not at all. So, once the wrist is returned to its proper position, apply the compress we described earlier, then bind it tightly and leave it for five days.
Afterward, loosen the binding and exercise the hand; if its movement is still impossible with some stiffness present, then soften it with warm water and massage it repeatedly until it becomes supple.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of finger joints.
When a finger joint dislocates in any direction, if one of the fingers becomes dislocated towards the back of the hand or its palm, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns to its place. Then bind the base of the finger and suspend it toward the direction from which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release and extend it until it stands upright that same day. If it is night, bind it in the same manner; continue to untie it during the day, exercising it with movement, and binding it at night. Do this for several days until it becomes firm.
Similarly, if it becomes dislocated towards the palm of the hand, bind it toward that same direction and treat it as you did before until it heals. The same should be done whenever it is dislocated in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
On the Treatment of Vertebral Dislocation.
When a complete dislocation of one or more vertebrae occurs, there is no treatment as death approaches swiftly for the afflicted individual.
This is indicated by the patient's involuntary defecation, an inability to control bowel movements, and frequent relaxation of certain body parts such as one or both legs, arms, or one side. If only a single vertebra is dislocated, it often resolves on its own.
Dislocation can occur in four directions, and the one towards the back is called a "hump." For those who develop this condition during childhood, there is no treatment available and it will never heal completely. However, if the dislocation results from a fall, blow, or similar incident, there are potential treatments.
Early physicians have described various treatment methods for this condition, but most of their lengthy explanations are not particularly helpful. I have summarized some of these treatments, which are largely based on verbal instructions and explanations that may be insufficient. The devices they describe have also been illustrated differently from how they were explained.
I say that the hump which occurs at the front of the chest is beyond remedy and cannot be cured, as are those which occur on either side; only that one occurring in the back can be treated with what I am about to describe: by stretching the patient out face down.
Place a bench that is level and close to the wall, spreading underneath it soft padding so as not to injure his chest; then put an upright piece of wood, planted in a hole dug in the ground at one end of the bench towards his head, and another piece of wood on the other side of the bench toward his feet.
A servant holds the piece of wood, which should not be fixed into the hole in the ground; another servant holds onto the other stick while both servants remain in this position. Wrap some soft yet firm bandages around the patient's chest and under his armpits, and then stretch one end of the fabric toward the stick near his head, securing it there with a knot.
Then, wrap another bandage around his hips and above his knees and around his ankles; gather together all the bands and tie them off at the other stick near his feet. Each servant then stretches their respective sticks to the limit of the bandages' reach while keeping both pieces of wood rooted in place within their holes.
However, as mentioned before, the sticks are not fixed into their holes; instead, have the doctor apply strong pressure with his hands upon the hump until it recedes or place a board on top of the bump and lean against that with both feet in order to push back upon it. If this does not work, take a plank about three arm's lengths long.
Carve a space in the wall we mentioned should be near to where the patient lies and insert one end of the plank into it; place the middle part upon his hump while planting the doctor's feet on its other side, then have him push hard so as to put pressure on the bump.
And it returns to its place; and if you wish to make it with the spiral which is twisted by hand, this is done by inserting into the ground at the patient's head at one end of the bench two pieces of wood each a cubit long, and also at their feet at the other end of the bench two more.
And the distance between each piece of wood should be one span, and a hole has been made in each piece of wood through which the spiral runs; all the pieces of wood are then secured firmly into the ground so that they do not move at all, and you insert a round stick - this is the spiral onto which the bandage is wound - into the holes in the two pieces of wood.
And at one end there is a hole in which a stick one span long has been secured, around which the bandage is wound; and similarly on the other two pieces of wood, then you tighten the bandages that have been tightened on the patient's chest onto the spiral near his head, and the bandages that were tied on their legs onto the spiral near their feet.
Then a servant stands by each spiral with the handle that is used to turn the spiral, while the physician regulates the hump as we have described; this is an illustration of the spiral, bench and patient: [insert image caption here].
Then, after the vertebrae have returned to their place and the area is even, you should take the dried bandage with white of egg, then some lint; afterwards, place over the bandage a splint made from a board three fingers wide or thereabouts in length according to how much of the hump has been reduced.
Then some smooth beads are added, then it is tied with the appropriate bandage; and the patient should take light food until healed; if there remains some protuberance in that area after full recovery, you should apply the medicines that relax and soften along with use of the board we have described for a long period.
You may use a lead plate for this [procedure]. Sometimes there is a protrusion at the end of the vertebrae that might be mistaken for dislocation, but it could be an excess bone growth. In such cases, do not subject it to this treatment as death may occur.
Chapter thirty-one.
Treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip and shoulder joints are susceptible only to dislocation, not to slight displacement or depression like other joints. The hip joint can be dislocated in four ways.
It dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward. It most commonly dislocates inward; rare is dislocation forward or backward. A sign of inward dislocation is that when you pair the healthy leg with the affected one, it appears longer.
The knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their leg at the groin. The area around the groin will appear swollen due to the head of the thigh bone having moved there.
Signs of outward dislocation are the opposite of these symptoms. For forward dislocation, the patient can fully extend their leg but cannot bend it without pain in the knee; they also cannot walk forward.
They retain urine, and their groin is swollen; when walking they step on their heel. For backward dislocation, the patient cannot extend or bend their knee before bending at the groin; their leg also appears shorter than the other.
The groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur should be felt at the level of the flank; as for resetting this fracture, you must look to see whether it is an old one that has endured with its owner and was not reduced before and remains in this state, then there is no treatment at all.
One should not expose oneself to it, and as for the fracture that has occurred recently, no matter which of the four types it is, you must start by twisting the joint and extending it inwards and outwards while moving it right and left; perhaps...
If it goes back and does not require further treatment, then that is fine; but if it doesn't return in this way, you should prepare a strong servant to extend his leg from below either with their hands or by using bandages tied above the knee, while another servant extends him from above.
He should insert his hands under the patient's armpits and then pull with soft bandages at the top of the thigh, while another servant holds onto the other end of the bandage; this extension can be done either from the front, towards the armpit and in the direction of the collarbone, or from behind, towards the back.
All of the servants should pull at the same time, lifting the patient's body off the ground and leaving him suspended; this type of extension is a common approach for all four fracture types. If the fracture reduces as we have described it, then that will do; otherwise, each fracture type will require specific treatment.
To reduce this type of fracture, the patient should lie on their right side; then a bandage is tied at the top of the thigh between the head of the femur and the area below the groin.
Then stretch the band upward from the groin area to above the body toward the clavicle region. Another strong assistant, supported by his arms, will embrace the affected thickened part of the thigh and stretch it outward with a strong pull; this will bring it back into place.
This type is easier than other treatment methods used to reposition this organ. If it proves difficult and the patient does not respond at all, you should tie both legs of the affected person together with a strong yet soft bandage placed over the heels and above the knees.
There should be a distance of about four fingers between each leg, and the affected leg should be extended further by two fingers than the other one. Then, suspend the patient from above using a wooden bar in the room, with their feet approximately two arms' lengths off the ground.
You then instruct a strong assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, while another assistant hangs on to the patient and pushes against the one embracing the thigh forcefully; this will rapidly bring the joint back into place. As for the specific method for reduction when the jaw is dislocated outwards...
The patient should lie on the table as described for the hunchback, with the bandage secured tightly around their affected leg and chest. Place one wooden bar near their feet and another by their head; an additional bar is placed in the middle of the table, fastened very securely.
Wrap damp cloths around these bars to avoid causing the patient any harm, ensuring that one of them is positioned between their thighs so as not to pull downwards during the stretch. Each assistant then stretches in their respective direction while the physician uses both hands to align the hip; if this brings it back into place...
Otherwise, place a board on it and press it down as we mentioned for the hump, except that the patient should lie on their healthy side. If the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be straightened in one movement while they are in this exact position on the bench.
The doctor places the palm of their right hand on the patient's groin and presses it with the other hand, while directing the pressure downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is backwards, the patient should not be straightened downwards.
The patient is elevated off the ground and placed on a solid object. Their hip should be unclasped outwards, as previously mentioned when lying on their stomach on the bench with the bandages tightened.
As we said earlier, pressure should also be applied with a board to the site where the joint has moved. Once the hip joint returns properly - which you will recognize by extending the patient's legs -
If you see that the legs are level and the patient can bend and straighten them without difficulty, then know that the limb has returned to its proper place. At this point, bring the thighs together, pick up the bandage, and wrap it tightly with a cloth so that the hip cannot move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days, then the bandage and splint are removed and the leg measured against the other one. If they appear equal in size, you know that the joint has healed securely and can allow the patient to walk. If there is any remaining slackness,
Return, dress it, and bandage it according to the initial tightness. Leave it for three days as well, then loosen it. He should walk slowly on it for some days until it strengthens. It shall be well, God willing.
Chapter thirty-two.
In the treatment of dislocated knee joints.
The knee joint dislocates in three ways: inward, outward, and downward (that is, backward). It never dislocates forward at all. The sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to draw up his leg onto their thigh.
If it does not stick to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. The setting of all forms of its dislocation is that you have the patient sit down with their legs stretched out if they can manage it; a servant should sit behind them and hold their waist, slightly twisting backwards. You must then sit on top of their thighs.
You must press your back against theirs, their leg between yours; then, you should take hold of the knee with both hands, linking them together in front of his knee and squeezing the sides of his knee joints tightly with your palms. Another servant stretches out his legs until the knee joint returns to its place.
The sign of its return is that the leg sticks to the thigh smoothly, not with force; then you must bandage it and stick the leg to the thigh. Then tie them together using a bandage for three or four days before releasing it; only allow minimal walking for some days until [the joint] strengthens.
If it is impossible for you to return the joint using what we have described, then use strong stretching with the straps I shall describe later in the treatment of the hip until [the knee] returns.
Chapter thirty-three.
In the treatment of the dislocated heel.
The heel may dislocate slightly or completely, and its dislocation can be either inward or outward. The sign of this condition is the swelling and prominence of the heel in the direction to which it has dislocated.
The treatment for its slight dislocation is simple and involves gently pulling it back into place by hand until it returns to normal. If the heel has completely dislocated, you should have the patient sit down and have a strong assistant hold them from behind at their waist with both hands.
Then, with your right hand, grasp their foot from above and with the left one, hold it from below at the heel. Pull the foot towards yourself twice - first with the right hand, then with the left. Then push down on the chest of the foot with your left hand while pulling its sole toward the shin with your right, but do so gently.
Repeat this process twice as described, and on the third time when you push the sole of the foot toward the shin, also pull it by its heel while pushing down on its chest with your hands. The foot should go back to its normal position within one or two attempts if done correctly; otherwise, repeat the procedure until it returns to normal.
If the foot does not return to its normal position using the described methods, place the patient on their back and insert a sturdy peg into the ground between their thighs, with cloth wrapped around it so that it doesn't hurt them. Then have an assistant hold onto their thigh.
Then another assistant either pulls the leg with their hands or attaches a strap to its neck and pulls it. Meanwhile, each assistant continues pulling in the opposite direction of the other while holding the peg between the patient's thighs so that their body doesn't move downward during this process. As they do so, the physician uses both hands to correct the dislocation.
Another servant holds the healthy leg downwards, and then the jaw returns quickly. Once the jaw has returned and you have confirmed its correct position, take the bandage and splint and secure it tightly with bindings. Tie the foot firmly with a ligament to keep it in place; be sure to avoid the nerve that is above the heel at the back.
To ensure the ligament is not too tight and causes harm, leave it for two or three days. If the binding slackens, tighten it again; then release it on the third or fourth day. The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If they attempt to walk before this period, there is a risk that the jaw may dislocate and become irreparably damaged; after which, treatment will be unsuccessful. If swelling occurs, it should be treated with the methods previously described for soothing inflammation and cooling down, until it subsides.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
Treatment of the Jaw of the Toe.
The dislocated toe should be gently aligned without force; this is not difficult, but rather simple to achieve. If the dislocation occurs in one of the joints on the top of the foot, the patient must place their foot flatly onto a level surface.
Or, you can place their foot onto a board while they are standing as if walking. Then, stand up and put your own foot on top of the dislocated joint; press down firmly with your foot to realign it until it is straightened out again and you see that there is no longer any protrusion visible at this site.
Next, place a board under the sole of their foot that is shaped to fully support it and has two ends; then tightly bind it securely for three days. Afterwards, you should loosen the bindings while ensuring they do not walk for many days until their foot gains strength again, at which point one can feel confident enough about its stability (God willing).
Chapter thirty-five.
The types of jaw that occur with a wound, or with a fracture, or both together.
When any of these occurs and its treatment and setting is required, it is often followed by death.
Therefore, no one should attempt to treat such a case unless they are skilled in the art, experienced, gentle, compassionate, patient, not rash or bold, and use only medicines that ease hot swellings at first, leaving the patient at peace.
It is up to fate, O Lord, unless you wish the patient safety from harm with a light illness and some hope appears for them; then remove it at once in the beginning before the hot swelling occurs.
If the limb returns as you wish, then use the treatment that eases hot swellings and treat the wound with appropriate drying ointments; if it is a jaw with a fracture and bone splinters are ejected, then remove them without delay. Follow in this what we have mentioned earlier regarding simple diseases in their appropriate places.
Exert your utmost effort and keep yourself away from embarking on risky paths, as I have advised you before; that is better for your reputation and safer for your person, God willing.
