Chapter 73.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids and warts and red swelling that occur in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are seen at the openings of many veins from which much blood continuously flows; and when hemorrhoids are old, warts are formed.
And I have already mentioned in the division the types of these and their signs, and I will also say which of these can be treated and which cannot be treated.
So I say that hemorrhoids and warts when they are at the base of the vagina and are not felt, then no treatment with iron should be done for those.
But those which are in the opening of the vagina and are felt, those are the ones that are treated.
And you need to place the woman in a warm bath and then extend the hemorrhoid with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut them at the roots.
Then sprinkle on them some of the powders that stop bleeding without stinging, such as acacia and similar ones.
Then bind her feet together for an hour, and then place her in cold water.
And if the bleeding persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peels and galls and similar things.
Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with it over the back of the area.
And if the bleeding stops, it is good; if not, use two cupping glasses, and on the breasts without scarification.
Then take wool and soak it in coriander juice or nightshade juice or rockrose juice with sour wine and apply it to the place; then treat the place with ointments until it is healed.
But a red wart which is of rough appearance, you need to cut that which appears to you of it as I have said in the treatment of hemorrhoids.
And treat it until it is healed.
