When the humors overcome the bronchial tubes of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be purged by laxative medicines; then cauterize him at the base of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat itself, and do not burn the heart but only a little.	When humidities prevail over the windpipe, and especially when there is a frigid temperament, the patient should first have his bowels opened with a laxative. Then cauterize him once in the hollow of the jugular fossa at the root of the throat in the hollow part. Take care that the cautery does not pierce through to the gullet, and burn no more than half of the thickness of the skin.	0.7602451
Then make another cauterization at the joint of the neck at the top of the spine, and let the cautery be the one called "clavile," of which we have the form before; and treat the area as we have said before until it is healed.	Then cauterize him once more, strongly, at the junction of the neck with its last vertebra, the cautery being claviform as described above. Then treat as prescribed before till healed.	0.73165596
