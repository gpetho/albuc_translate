Castration is forbidden in our religion.	Castration is forbidden in our law and I ought therefore to make no mention of it in my book.	0.605556
Therefore, it would have been fitting for me not to mention it in this book of mine, but I mentioned it for two reasons: one is so that it may be within the physician's knowledge if he is asked about it and so that he knows the treatment for anyone afflicted by it, and the other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.	But I must speak of it for two reasons. One reason is that it should be part of the doctor's medical knowledge when asked about it, and that he should know how to treat anyone whom it befalls. Another reason is that often we need to castrate certain animals for the sake of the benefits that accrue from them, such as rams, he-goats and cats, and such animals.	0.7908803
Like lambs, goats, cats, and other such animals.  I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by incision and cutting. The one that is by crushing, the way to perform it is that we sit the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.	Another reason is that often we need to castrate certain animals for the sake of the benefits that accrue from them, such as rams, he-goats and cats, and such animals. So I say that castration can be performed in two ways: either by contusion; or by opening up and cutting away. The method by contusion is that we make the animal sit in warm water until his testes are relaxed and become soft and pendent; then rub them with your hand until they are so loosened that they are no longer palpable.	0.81555414
Then you crush them with your hand until they dissolve and cannot be discerned by touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary to hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the spermatic cords and make one incision on each testicle.	As to castration by open operation and excision, the animal should be held and pressure put upon the scrotum with the left hand. Then tie the spermatic cord and with one incision cut down upon both testicles so that both are brought up out of the scrotum.	0.73602945
So that when the testicles protrude, you cut them after peeling them, and leave nothing of the membranes on them except the thin membrane that is on the vessels.  This type of castration is better than the one that is by crushing.	After dissecting them away cut them off; do not leave any of the coverings upon them except the thin membrane covering the vessels.	0.6932595
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal desires intercourse. Then treat the wound until it heals.	This manner of castration is better than the contusion method, for contusion often leaves something of the testicles, and the animal desires to couple. Then dress the wound until healed.	0.68145657
