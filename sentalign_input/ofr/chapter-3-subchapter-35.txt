of wound and dislocation together
When a wound occurs with the dislocation, and one wants to treat it, it often happens that the patient dies:
so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, unless you are wise in the art and you have practiced it for a long time, and unless you are compassionate and merciful and careful, not reckless;
and at the beginning, use soothing things for a hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands, if you see no hope of health;
and when you see hope, then immediately return the limb to its place, before a hot abscess develops there;
and when the limb is in place, then administer things that soothe a hot abscess, and treat the wound, as appropriate, with drying ointments;
and if along with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bone fragments separated, remove them, and do what we have said about simple maladies;
and beware of entering the path of fear, according to what I have said, for this benefits you according to your Creator, and for the safety of your soul and your body.
