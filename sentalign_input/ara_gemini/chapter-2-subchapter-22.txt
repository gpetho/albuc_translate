Chapter twenty-two on the treatment of leukoderma.
This ailment, which is called 'kamana', is a duration that gathers in the eye, resembling dripping water, but it is not water.
And the way to treat this is that you sit the patient upright on a chair, then you take his head with your hands from both sides and move it until you see the 'duration' move to the bottom of his eye, then it stabilizes and doesn't move, and the light is released, and the patient sees things as he used to see them.
And if it does not descend to the bottom, we know that it is water.
If the descent of the 'duration' is not possible by what we mentioned, then sit the patient between your hands, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision above the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the 'iklil' (limbus) until the substance comes out.  Once it comes out, instill in the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled. Then treat with other treatments until he recovers.
