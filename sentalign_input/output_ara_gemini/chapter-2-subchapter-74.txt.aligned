Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, petrified tumors, ulcers, abscesses, corroding sores, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors, and all these diseases, their types, and their signs have been mentioned in the classification, so it is appropriate that we mention in this article the hot tumor that occurs in the uterus, if it is among the tumors that collect matter, how its opening with iron instruments should be.	From time to time there occur in the womb various kinds of tumour, such as cancer and the stony tumour and ulcer and abscess and gangrene and fistulae and varicosities and cracks and warts and inflamed tumours; all these diseases I have mentioned, with their varieties and their symptoms, in the appropriate section. But now in this treatise we must mention an inflamed tumour of the kind where there is a collection of pus, and the manner of its opening with the knife.	0.79132605
It is appropriate, if you want to use this instrument, that you estimate the depth of the woman's uterus with a probe, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus and harm the patient, and if the instrument is longer than the depth, it is appropriate that supports be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and it is appropriate that the screw that runs in the instrument be on the upper side while you hold the instrument and the servant turns the screw until the cervix opens.	When you are going to use this instrument, you should measure with a probe the depth of the womb so that the instrument be not introduced beyond this measure lest the patient be harmed; if the instrument be longer, pads should be put over the rim of the cervix to prevent the passage of its whole length. You must put the screw that runs in the instrument, in from the top and hold the instrument while your assistant turns the screw until the entrance of the uterus is opened.	0.88268787
The uterus and the wound may also be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water in which licorice root or long birthwort has been boiled, then return to the ointment.	Sometimes also both the wound and the uterus are washed out with a douche of honey and water, then of a decoction of liquorice root or long aristolochy; then go back to the ointment.	0.7855319
If the abscess is hidden inside the uterus, it is appropriate to refrain from treating it with iron, rather it should be treated with what we mentioned in the classification.	But if the lesion be hidden in the depths of the womb then you will have to abstain from operative treatment but carry out treatment as spoken of in its place.	0.6704464
