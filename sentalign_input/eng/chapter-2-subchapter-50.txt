 CHAPTER FIFTY.
On the tumour arising from the twisting of a tendon.
 As a tumour arises on an artery or a vein, so may it also come in a tendon when it has been bruised; or it may arise from excessive fatigue, or such causes.
This occurs mostly at the wrists, at the heel, and at all sites of articular movement.
It is a hard tumour of the same colour as the rest of the body, and is generally painless, and when strong pressure is put upon it the patient has a numb feeling in it.
It is a tumour that does not form in the deeper tissues but is subcutaneous.
It is freely movable laterally, but will not go forward or backward.
Those that are situated on joints should certainly not be tackled with the knife, for that often causes palsy.
Incise the skin of those occurring on the head or forehead, and if the tumour be small take hold of it with the forceps and cut it away by the root.
But if it be large, catch it up with a hook and dissect it away and remove it; and sew up the incision and dress until healed.
