On the Dislocation of the Knee.
Chapter 33.
The knee is dislocated in three ways.
It dislocates outward, inward, and downward, specifically backward.
And it does not dislocate forward.
The sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the patient to bring his leg toward his hip.
If it does not adhere to the hip, then know that the knee is dislocated.
The method of restoring all types of its dislocation is to have the patient sit upright so that he can extend his leg over it if he can, and press your back against his face, placing his foot between your feet.
Then clasp his knee with your palms and straighten them between your fingers over his knee.
Then press both sides of his knee with your palm with strength.
And another assistant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
The sign of its return is that the leg joins with the hip smoothly, not with difficulty.
Then apply a plaster, and make the leg adhere to the hip.
Then bind them together with a band for three or four days.
Then loosen them.
And the patient should not walk for a few days until it heals.
But if its reduction is resisted, then perform a strong extension with bands, as previously described in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
