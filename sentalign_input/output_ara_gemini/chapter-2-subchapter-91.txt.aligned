This vein is generated in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and the countries of the Arabs, and in hot, dry, and infertile countries.	This kind of vein occurs in the leg in hot countries such as the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs and in hot arid infertile countries.	0.9051018
And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body other than the legs.	It also often occurs in other parts of the body beside the legs.	0.7329653
And its generation is from putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as it occurs inside living bodies, worms, bottle gourds, and the worms generated between the skin and the flesh.	The origin of it is a corruption taking place beneath the skin in the same way that round-worms and worms and gourd-worms arise in the inward parts of the body; also the worms that are generated between the skin and the flesh.	0.7496483
And the sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that severe inflammation occurs in the leg. Then the place blisters. Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that blister as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.	The sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is a violent inflammation in the leg; then the place swells up and blisters; then the vein begins to extrude at the blistered place as if it were a plant-stem or an animal.	0.87598455
So when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead, whose weight is from one dirham to two dirhams. And tie it and leave the lead hanging from the leg.	When its extremity has appeared it should be wound and tied round a little piece of lead, from one to two drachms in weight, which you leave hanging from the leg.	0.8257638
So whenever something comes out of it, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut some of it and wrap the rest. And do not cut it from its origin before all of it comes out, because if you cut it, it will shrink and enter the flesh, so it will cause swelling and putrefaction in the place and a bad ulcer.	Then as fast as any of it issues from the leg, wrap it in the lead, and if there be plenty of it cut off part and tie the rest of it; do not cut it right down until it has all come out; for if you cut it right down it will contract and draw back into the flesh and produce at the place an abscess and suppuration and a bad ulcer.	0.85138476
Therefore, it should be handled gently and pulled little by little until it comes out completely and nothing of it remains in the body.	Therefore it should be treated gently, and drawn out slowly until the very extremity of it emerges and not the least bit of it remains in the body.	0.8892317
And from this vein, in some people, may come out what is five cubits and ten in length. And it has reached me that it came out for a man twenty cubits.	In some cases the vein comes out five or ten spans in length; indeed I have heard of one twenty spans long that came out from a certain man.	0.7747209
If it breaks for you while you are treating it, insert a probe into its hole. And push it slowly and for a long time with the body until all the matter in it is emptied. And try to disinfect the place with medicines for days. Then treat it with the treatment for swellings.	If it breaks during your treatment of it, then pass a probe into the hole and open it up with a long incision longitudinally, until all the contained matter is evacuated; and try to make the place suppurate with medicines for a few days, then treat as an abscess.	0.8726804
And this vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint of the leg or in the leg itself. So it will have many mouths, and a branch comes out of each mouth.	Sometimes also this vein is found branching, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot itself; and in this case there are many openings and a branch comes out of each.	0.7801661
So treat it as we mentioned in the division and with what preceded.	The treatment is as mentioned above in the section.	0.49214035
