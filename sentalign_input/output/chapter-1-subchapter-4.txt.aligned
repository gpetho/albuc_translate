On the Cauterization of Chronic Migraine	On the cauterization of chronic migraine.	0.8711916
When you treat chronic migraine with the remedies we have previously described and those outlined in the sections on diseases, and if the treatment does not work, and you see that it is necessary to go beyond what was described in the initial cautery with medicine or cautery with fire, then you must ignite the cautery iron until it is white-hot. Mark the spot of the pain with a line about half the length of a finger, or nearly so; place your hand firmly once and press it until you cut through the skin and reach the bone.	When you have treated a migraine in the way we have described and with what we have mentioned in the sections on diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you perceive that the malady is such that the cauterization we have mentioned before does not suffice for it, either with caustic or with the actual cautery, you should heat an edged cautery to white heat after you have marked the place with a line half a finger's breadth long or thereabouts; and impress your hand once and maintain the pressure till you cut down upon the artery and reach the bone.	0.9101517
However, it is necessary to avoid the continuation of the jaw, which moves during mastication, and to ensure that the muscle is not burned and the nerve that controls it is not damaged, to prevent spasms.	You must be careful of the mandibular joint which moves in chewing, that you do not cut the muscle or tendon that moves it, causing spasm.	0.71199036
And it is crucial to be cautious about the blood flow from the artery that may be cut, as there is fear in cutting it, especially for those who are inexperienced and not diligent or trained; leave the operation at that initial stage.	Have the utmost care of haemorrhage from the artery you have cut, for the occurrence of that is dangerous, specially with one who does not know what to do, having no experience or practice; it is better to refrain from operating.	0.7799425
I will come back with a reminder about the management of accidental bleeding from the artery in its proper place in this book.	We shall later on mention a treatment for accidental haemorrhage of the artery, in due detail, in its proper place in this book.	0.75339055
And if you see that this disease is not addressed by this cautery and the patient's body is strong enough, cauterize in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it is healed.	But if you see that this cautery is not enough for this disorder and you see that the patient is of bodily fitness for it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound till healed.	0.8772131
And if you wish, use the cautery method mentioned in the chapter on arterial constriction with a cautery with two blades; this is a better and more effective cauterization.	If you prefer, employ that cauterization which we have described in the chapter on the extraction of an artery, with the cautery of two blades; for that is a cauterization better and more effective than this.	0.88092244
