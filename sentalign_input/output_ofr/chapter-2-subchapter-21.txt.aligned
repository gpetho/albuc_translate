of the breaking of the uvea When a disruption occurs in the uvea, then it opens, and matter comes out of the eyelids like a grain of resin, and it is frightening to see;	When a rupture befalls the uveal membrane so that it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids looking like a grape, and on this account the man's features are disfigured; if you intend to cut it away the operation will be as I am about to describe.	0.60955673
then if you see fit to cut it, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the part underneath, up to the one above, then insert another needle with a double thread from the corner of the eye; and pierce it there, and leave the first needle according to the arrangement;	You introduce a needle to the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper segment; then you introduce another needle threaded with a double thread, from the region of the canthus major where you will perforate it; and leave the first needle in its place.	0.7223469
then cut the place of the double thread and tie one part of the uvea around it, and tighten it well, then remove the needle and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye;	Then cut the place of doubling of the doubled thread, and with it ligature that part of the excrescence around the needle and tie it well. Then remove the needle and apply to the eye wool moistened with egg-white; and leave till the thread falls away with the growth.	0.81057477
and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;	Then treat the eye with fortifying dressings till the wound be healed.	0.63776386
and sometimes the wound is held together by the uvea, all around, with a circle of cloth, until it is healed.	Sometimes the uvea is tied all round with a circle of material so that the prominence of the eye is greatly increased.	0.55636823
And if the eye swells considerably, pierce it at the thin spot that comes from deep within the eye, and drain the albuginous moisture so the eye goes down, and enter it immediately;	Then you perforate it with a fine scalpel going to the depth of the eye; and an albuminous humour will flow out and the eye will shrink and return at once.	0.6719305
then remove it once it is healed.	Then bandage till healed.	0.59175944
