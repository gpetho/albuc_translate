of hail (or possibly: about hail)
Often there appear on the eyelids things that resemble hail in their shape and hardness, and because of this this disease is called "grandine" (hailstone), and it is a collection of thick moisture in the eyelid above and below; the procedure is as follows: see if the hailstone moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to determine; then cut it widely, then peel it from each side gently, then take it with tweezers, and cut it. 
If you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it does not harm the patient; and if the cut is large, join it with a suture, and treat it until it is healed; and if it is small, do not force it, for the ointment will soon restore it and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone descends inside the ear towards the upper part, turn the eyelid inside out, and stretch the hailstone with tweezers, and cut and press from one side and the other; and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, it does not matter; and when the hailstone is cut, wash the eye with salt water, and treat the area with that which generates flesh until the patient is healed.
