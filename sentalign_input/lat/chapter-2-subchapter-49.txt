On the incision of an abscess that occurs because of an artery or a vein.
Chapter 49.
When an artery bursts, and the skin above it heals, an abscess often occurs there; the same also happens to a vein, where an abscess and swelling occur in it.
The signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are due to an artery or vein are as follows: when an abscess is caused by an artery, it is long and deep within the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as though it has a creaking sensation.
And that which is due to a vein is round and visible on the body.
And an incision on this type of abscess is an error, especially one located under the armpits, in the groin, on the neck, and in many areas of the body, and it is very large.
Therefore, treatment with a blade should be avoided, and anything in the extremities or on the head should also be avoided.
On any of these caused by the swelling of an artery’s opening, make a lengthwise incision in the skin.
Then open the incision with hooks, and expose the artery: and free it from its coverings until it is revealed.
Next, insert a needle beneath it, passing it through to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread in two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries located in the temples.
Then puncture the area between the two ligatures with a small scalpel until all the blood contained within flows out, and the abscess is relieved.
Then administer a treatment that promotes pus formation, until the ligatures fall off: afterward, treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
But if the abscess is due to the incision of a vein, then you should hold as much of the abscess and skin as possible with your hand.
Then insert a needle under the place you held with your hand and make it penetrate, and let it have a double thread until you pull it out from the other side.
Then tie the abscess tightly with the thread, as I have told you with the grape ligature, on both sides with the two ends of the thread.
If you are worried that the thread might come loose, then insert another needle with another thread beneath the entire abscess near the needle’s incision; press and tie your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in the middle until its contents come out; then remove the excess skin, leaving the tied part.
Then place on it a small compress soaked in wine and oil.
Then apply treatment with linen and ointments until it heals.
