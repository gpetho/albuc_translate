On the treatment of unopened anal fistula.	On imperforate anus.	0.5082611
Many boys are born with their anuses unopened, blocked by a thin membrane. The midwife should perforate this membrane with her finger, or else incise it with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to touch the muscle.	Infants are quite often born with the anus imperforate, closed by a fine membrane; then the midwife should perforate the membrane with her finger or pierce it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.	0.8720832
Then she should place on it wool dipped in wine and oil, then treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear it will close, place a lead tube in the opening for many days and remove it whenever the child needs to defecate.	Then wool dipped in oil and wine should be applied, and treat it with ointments until healed. If you are afraid it may close up, put into the opening a leaden tube for many days, which will be removed when the child wants to evacuate the bowel.	0.91939723
Blockage of the anus can also occur from the healing of a wound or swelling.  This healed area should be incised, then treated with the aforementioned remedies and lead tube.	Sometimes also the anus is closed by the scarring of a wound or an abscess; then the scarring should be incised, and then dressed by those methods we have mentioned, including the leaden tube.	0.759513
