of lethargy	On cauterization for lethargy due to phlegm.	0.40648583
For this disease, it is necessary to give the patient strong purgatives and pills that cleanse the brain; afterward, shave the patient's entire head, and place on the occiput the mustard plaster that is described in the treatise on plasters; and this is the manner of the cautery: do it as I have said.	First, great electuaries should be given to the patient to drink; and pills to clear the head. Then let his whole head be shaved and apply a mustard plaster to the hinder part as described in the treatise on plasters.	0.7863374
If he is healed this way, it is good; and if not, make three cauteries from the middle of the head down to the neck, spaced a finger's width apart; and treat them as the others, and if you want to add more, and the patient is enduring, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two more on the two corners, and treat until healed; and use the cautery called "olivare", as I have said before.	That should be applied several times as it is a kind of cauterization; do it in the very way described there. If he is cured, well and good; but if not, burn him with three cauterizations on the back of the head, arranging them in a row downward from the upper part of the head to the base of the neck; and make an interval between each pair of one finger's breadth. Then treat as aforesaid. If you wish to add to these cauterizations and the patient be fit to bear it, give him a burn in the middle; and if still more, then burn him on the two frontal prominences.	0.8965794
