We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medications and the warning against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate. We have also mentioned cancer generated in the uterus and the warning against treating it.	We have spoken, in the relevant section, of the kinds of cancer and of the way in which medical treatment of them is to be attempted; with a warning against treatment by the knife lest they ulcerate. We also mentioned the cancer arising in the uterus and gave a warning against its treatment.	0.8941339
The ancients mentioned that when the cancer is in a place where it can be completely excised, such as cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar accessible organs, to remove it entirely, especially if it is incipient and small. But when it is advanced and large, it should not be touched.	The Ancients said that when a cancer is in a site where total eradication is possible, such as a cancer of the breast or of the thigh, and in similar parts where complete removal is possible, and especially when in the early stage and small, (then surgery was to be tried). But when it is of long standing and large you should leave it alone.	0.8664949
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that. The procedure for it, if it is accessible as we said, is to first give the patient several doses of black bile, then bleed him if there is clear fullness in the veins.	For I myself have never been able to cure any such, nor have I seen anyone else succeed before me. The procedure in a case amenable to treatment, as we have said, is first for the patient to be purged several times from black bile; then bleed him if his veins seem full.	0.8836936
Then place the patient in a position suitable for the operation, then insert the appropriate hooks into the cancer, then excise it from all sides with the skin completely so that nothing of its roots remains, and let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.	Then put the patient in the most convenient position for operating. Then attach to the tumour hooks suited to it; then make a circular incision all round to include the skin with the utmost thoroughness so that not the least root of it remains; let the blood flow and do not stanch it quickly; but put pressure upon the place and squeeze out all the thick blood, either by hand or with any instrument you can.	0.771374
Rather, squeeze the areas and extract all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can. If during the procedure you encounter profuse bleeding from a severed artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.	If in operating you get a very severe haemorrhage from cutting an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops; then dress in the usual way until healed.	0.75485754
