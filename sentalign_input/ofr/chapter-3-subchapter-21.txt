of the limb that is weak after healing
When the bone fracture is restored, and the limb remains weak and thin afterward, it happens for many reasons:
one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been;
or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb;
or because of excessive irrigation (washing/bathing);
or because of too much movement, not at the right time;
or because he has little blood in his body, and is thus weak.
And the treatment is that you make the patient eat, and make the body supple, until the blood is increased in him; 
and administer baths to him, and give him joy and happiness;
then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch attracts great nourishment to it, and frequently bathe it with warm water, so that the nourishment flows to the limb;
and it returns to its natural form.
