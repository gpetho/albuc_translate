On the Treatment of Knee Dislocation.	On dislocation of the knee.	0.7306715
The knee dislocates in three ways: it dislocates inwards, outwards, and downwards—I mean backwards—and it does not dislocate forwards at all. The sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to press his leg against his thigh.	The knee is dislocated in three ways; it is dislocated interiorly and exteriorly and inferiorly, that is, posteriorly. It is never dislocated anteriorly.	0.82174116
If it does not stick to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. The treatment for all its dislocations is to have the patient sit down with his legs extended, if he is able to do so, and have an assistant sit behind him to hold his waist and bend it back a little, then you sit on his thighs.	The sign of dislocation is to bid the patient flex his leg on his thigh, and if it does not reach the thigh you may know the knee is dislocated. The way of setting all the types of dislocation is to make the patient sit down with both legs extended, if he can, with an assistant sitting behind him to hold him by the middle and incline him slightly backward.	0.8343426
Place your back against his face and put his leg between your legs, then grasp his knee with your palms, interlocking your fingers over his knee. Then squeeze the sides of his knee firmly with your palms, while another assistant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.	Then do you yourself sit on his thighs with your back to his front, and put his leg between yours; then the palms of your hands should be applied to his knee, and join them together by twining the fingers; then with the palms put strong pressure on both sides of his knee while another assistant extends his foot until the knee goes back to its place.	0.9258228
The sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh smoothly and without force. Then bandage it and press the leg against the thigh, then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.  He should only undertake a little walking for several days until it strengthens.	The sign of its return is that the leg can be flexed back easily and without hindrance upon the thigh. Then apply a plaster and flex the leg on to the thigh and bandage them together for three or four days; then loosen them. He should do little walking for some days until it gains strength.	0.9408904
If its return is difficult for you using what we have described, then use strong traction with the bandages that we described previously in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.	But if you cannot effect reduction by this method, apply powerful extension by bandages as we have described above for the treatment of the hip, until it goes back.	0.78492975
