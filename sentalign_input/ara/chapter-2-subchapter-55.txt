Chapter Fifty-Five.
On the treatment of children born with imperforate urethras, or with narrow openings, or openings in the wrong place.
Some boys may emerge from their mother's womb with an imperforate urethra.  It is necessary to proceed immediately with its perforation as soon as he is born.
With a very fine scalpel, like this:
Then place in the hole a thin lead probe and tie it in place and keep it there for three or four days. When he needs to urinate, remove it and after he urinates replace it. And if you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows through the opening will prevent it from closing.
As for the one whose opening is narrow, it is treated with the lead probe as we have described for many days until it widens. And those whose opening is in the wrong place, that is, some are born with the opening at the end of the penis, so they cannot urinate forward.
So he must lift the penis with his hand in order to urinate. And he is not born this way because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line, and this is a very ugly condition.  The way to operate in this case is to have the patient lie on his back.
Then you stretch his penis with your left hand, stretching it firmly, and you cut the tip of the urethra with a blade or a sharp scalpel, the size of a pen, or as if you are carving something so that its middle protrudes, resembling a penis, and so that the opening is located in the middle as it should be.
And be cautious during the procedure of bleeding, for it often happens, so counteract it with what stops the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
