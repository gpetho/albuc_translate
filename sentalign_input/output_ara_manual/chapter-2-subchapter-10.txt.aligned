On the treatment of pterygium that occurs in the eyelid.	On the treatment of hydatid in the upper lid.	0.48806998
Pterygium is a small fleshy mass that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it most commonly occurs in children, and it makes their eyes heavy, and they experience discharges in the mornings, and they are unable to look at sunlight. Because tears flow to them quickly.	Hydatid is fat which arises in the folds of the upper lid. It is a disease chiefly occurring in children, irritating their eyes, giving them morning catarrh; they are unable to look full into the light of the sun, since they get an immediate secretion of tears.	0.72459394
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, swollen and puffy, and the pterygium appears clearly. When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the pterygium between them.  The procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap.	And for that reason you will find them lying always on their faces, and they also sleep on their faces; and the eyelids below the eyebrows are moist and covered with swellings, while the hydatid stands out prominently; and when you press upon the place with your finger you can feel the fat beneath it. The manner of operating is for the patient to let his head rest in your lap.	0.80359626
Then you take a linen cloth and prepare a wick from it and make a circle from that wick as large as it surrounds the pterygium from all sides, then you place it on it and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the pterygium in the center of the circle.	Then you take a scrap of linen and prepare a pad of it. Make it into a circle of sufficient size to enclose the whole of the hydatid on all sides, then place it on it and squeeze with your fingers on all sides, so as to gather up the hydatid in the centre of the circle.	0.8808253
Then you make a transverse incision in the middle of that moist area with a lancet. The incision should not be larger than the incision made in bloodletting. As for the depth, you should incise the entire skin until you reach the pterygium.	Then in the middle of this humidity make a crosswise incision with a lancet, but do not let the incision be larger than that made for a venesection. As to the depth, the skin should be incised right through till you come to the hydatid, which in most cases will come out from the incision, in the shape of a white piece of fat.	0.8199005
In most cases, the pterygium protrudes from the incision like a piece of white fat. You pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your fingers while rotating your hand right and left until it comes free. Beware of extending the incision, lest the lancet slip into the eye and injure it.	Draw it out with a cloth rolled between your fingers, turning your hand to right and to left till it is separated. Be careful not to go so deep with your scalpel that it sticks in the eye and injures it.	0.6497296
If the pterygium does not appear to you at the first incision, you should gently extend the incision a little until the pterygium appears, then pull it out as we have said. Then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area and bandage it softly. Some people crush salt.	If you do not see the hydatid at the first incision, you must gently cut a little deeper till it comes forth, then draw it out as described. Then dip some cloth in vinegar and water, apply to the place and bind it up with pads. There are some who grind up salt and put it in the hollow of the incision to liquefy thereby the remains of the humidity.	0.83151585
And place it in the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.	Then dress till healed. If an effusion occur in the place, treat with sedative plasters till healed.	0.7244502
