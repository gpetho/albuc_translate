Chapter fifty-three on the treatment of cancer
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medicines and the warning against treating it with iron so that it does not ulcerate.
And we mentioned the cancer generated in the uterus and the warning against treating it.
And the ancients mentioned that whenever the cancer is in a place where it can be completely eradicated, such as the cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar accessible organs, to remove it entirely, especially if it is nascent and small.
But when it is advanced and large, it should not be approached, for I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me reach that.
And the procedure in it, if it is accessible as we said, is that you proceed to purge the patient with black bile several times, then bleed him if there is a clear fullness in the veins.
Then you position the patient in a position that allows you to work, then you place in the cancer the hooks that are suitable for it, then you scrape it from every side with the skin thoroughly so that nothing of its roots remains.
And let the blood flow and do not cut it off quickly, but squeeze the areas and drain all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can.
If you encounter in the procedure a large bleeding from the cutting of an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
