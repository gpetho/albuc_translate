of the movement of the teeth
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat it with medicines and it is of no use, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery whose shape will be given later in such a way that you place a link on the tooth; and apply the hot cautery quickly inside, and hold your hand there until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth; then remove your hand and reapply the cautery as you wish; afterwards have the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it there for an hour and then spit it out. 
And in this way the tooth that was loose is strengthened, and the softened gum tightened, and the corrupted moisture dried.
