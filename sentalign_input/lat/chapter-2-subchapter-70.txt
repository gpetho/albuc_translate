On the treatment of two types of hermaphroditism.
Chapter 70.
Hermaphroditism among males occurs in two forms.
One form appears as a space or in the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, resembling the shape of a woman’s vulva, with hair present; and sometimes urine flows from the area in the skin of the testicles.
In women, there is one form where the vulva is located on the pubic area, resembling the small testicles of a male, slightly protruding outward: one part resembles a male penis, and two parts resemble two testicles.
The treatment for these three types—two forms in males and one form in females—is to cut away the excess flesh until its impression disappears.
Then, treat them with the usual wound care until healed.
For the second type in men, where urine flows from the skin of the testicles, there is no operation or treatment whatsoever.
