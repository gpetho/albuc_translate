When you treat the disease of the spleen as we have mentioned in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three ways of cautery that are all good.	When you have treated disease of the spleen by the means that we have mentioned in the section and your treatment is ineffectual, there will be three ways of cauterization, each of which will be correct.	0.874682
One method is to make three or four cauteries in a line along the length of the spleen, according to the shape of the liver cautery we mentioned earlier; do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the patient lie on his back;	One is to make three or four cauterizations in a row over the long axis of the spleen like the cauterization of the liver, a figure of which has been given above. Let there be between each pair of burns a finger's breadth or a little more.	0.7575823
Another method of cautery is to heat the cautery with two nerves, as we showed in the dislocation of the shoulder; lift the core that is at the spleen, where the patient's ribs come on the left side, and the elevation where you lift the core should be along the length of the body, and the cauteries should be along the width of the body.	The second method is to heat the cautery provided with two prongs, described in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder. Lift up the skin over the spleen at the level of the patient's left elbow; and let the fold of skin lie across the patient's body so that the cauterizations will fall longitudinally.	0.80787647
Then insert the two burning nerves until the core is pierced on the other side, and then remove the cautery, and there will be four. And if you wish, cauterize with the cautery with three nerves. Afterward, treat when it has expelled pus for a long time, and this is much better than the other treatments mentioned earlier.	Then push in the two prongs, well heated, till you have pierced the skin from side to side. Then take out the cautery; and there are four cauterizations. Or if you prefer you can burn with the other cautery, of three prongs. Then dress the site of cauterization after you have allowed pus to run therefrom for many days.	0.795876
