It is necessary when you treat the tooth for its pain that you delay pulling it as long as you can, because it should not be done; because it is a very serious matter until there is no excuse for scraping.
So when the patient is forced to pull the tooth, you must be sure of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they believe it is in the healthy tooth, and have the good tooth pulled; and yet the pain does not go away until the bad one is extracted, as we have already seen with these lords; and when you are sure of the aching tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a strong spatula to protect the gums on all sides; then move it with your fingers or with delicate forceps little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly fix the forceps; and let the patientâ€™s head be in your lap between your knees, and hold him well so that he does not move.
Then extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out, take one of these instruments and insert it on each side lightly, and move it as you did at first. And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with cloth where the holes are; and then extract it delicately with forceps, so that it does not break during extraction; and you must work very carefully around the gums to loosen the tooth.
And be careful not to break it, and leave a part behind, causing the patient greater pain than before due to the root. And beware not to act like some ignorant surgeons, who, in their haste and boldness, sometimes break the jaw and do not administer what we have described; but sometimes cause great harm by leaving the roots behind or breaking the jaw, as we have often seen; and when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine or vinegar and salt; and if there is bleeding, which often happens, fill the area with ground vitriol; and if that does not work, cauterize it.
The forms of the instruments used to loosen the teeth first should have long points and thick handles, so they do not bend when you pull the tooth; and these are the forms:
And they should be thick so they do not bend when pulling, and made of well-crafted iron, and should have teeth to hold the tooth firmly.
