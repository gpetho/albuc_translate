Chapter fifty-five on the treatment of children who are born and places.	CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE.	0.40711483
Their urine [opening] is not perforated, or the perforation is narrow, or in the wrong place.	On the treatment of boys born with imperforate urinary meatus; or with the meatus small or not in the proper place.	0.46132088
Some boys may come out of their mother's womb with their urethra not perforated.	Sometimes a boy is born from his mother's womb with the glans penis not perforate.	0.75719887
So it is necessary to hasten to perforate it from the hour he is born with a very thin scalpel in this way:	So at the moment of his birth you should be quick and make a perforation with a fine scalpel figured thus.	0.7196363
Then you put in the hole a thin nail made of lead, tie it and keep it for three or four days, and when he wants to urinate, remove it and let him urinate, then put it back.	Then put in the opening a slender leaden sound, tie it and keep it in for three or four days. When he wishes to make water, it will be removed and he will do so; then put it back.	0.86372674
And if you do not use the lead, it is possible that the urine that passes over the place will not let it close.	If you do not put in the leaden sound it may be that the urine passing through the place will prevent the wound from healing.	0.6943284
As for the one whose hole is narrow, it is treated with the lead, as we said, for many days until it widens.	The case having too narrow a meatus should be treated with the leaden sound, as we have said, for many days until it is wide enough.	0.7594658
And those whose hole is not in its place, that is, some of them are born with the hole at the end of the penis, so he cannot urinate forward until he lifts the urethra with his hand upwards. And he is not born from the front because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line, and this is a very ugly condition.	In those cases having a misplaced meatusâ€”for example, there are some born with the opening at the edge of the glans so that they cannot make water forwards until the opening of the penis is lifted up by hand, nor can they beget, since the semen cannot reach directly to the uterus, a disorder which is very ugly.	0.76753503
The way to do this is to have the patient lie on his back, then stretch his penis with your left hand with a strong stretch, and sharpen the head of the urethra with a blade or a sharp scalpel the size of a pen, or as if you were carving something so that its middle would be prominent, similar to a penis, and so that the hole would be in the middle as it should be.	The manner of operating in this case is for the patient to lie back; then with your left hand draw out his glans firmly and cut the end of the glans at the place of the meatus with a broad knife or sharp scalpel, as if sharpening a pen, or as if you were whittling something, so that the middle of it protrudes like a glans penis and the opening falls in the middle as it should.	0.87628484
And beware of bleeding during your work, for it often happens, so counteract it with something that stops the blood and treat the wound until it heals.	And beware, in your operating, of haemorrhage, which often happens; meet it with styptics and dress the wound until it heals.	0.72540903
