Chapter Eighteen on Cauterizing Cleft Lip
Often there occurs a fissure in the lip called the hair.
And especially in the lips of boys, it often occurs.
If you treat this fissure with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment does not succeed, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery in this way:
Its depth should be as thin as a knife.
Then you place it hot, quickly, in the same fissure.
Until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissure.
Then you treat it with cerate until it heals, God willing.
