On the Method of Cauterizing the Kidneys	On cauterization of the kidneys.	0.66555256
When kidney pain arises due to cold or thickened wind (gas), and this reduces the patientâ€™s virility, it is necessary to cauterize over the kidneys on the area called the almethen. Apply a nail-shaped cautery to each kidney, as previously described.	When pain strikes the kidneys from chill or heavy vapour, and the patient's sexual vigour is impaired thereby, you should burn him right over the kidneys, once on each kidney, with the claviform cautery mentioned before.	0.63894796
