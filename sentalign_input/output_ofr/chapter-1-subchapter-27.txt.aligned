and have a space between each cautery the width of a finger; and let the cauteries be along the length of the body, and do not press your hand very hard with the whole cautery;	Let there be a finger's breadth between each pair of cauterizations and let the burning be straight along the length of the body. Do not press the cautery hard with your hand.	0.8272117
and only burn half of the core, and let the patient stand upright on his feet;	Let the thickness of the skin you burn be half its thickness, not more; and let the patient be standing on his feet during the cauterization.	0.5914843

And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a knife, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and be careful not to burn the whole core, for you would dry out the whole body; and do not let it come to a boil, for the core is very delicate there, and know this for certain.	You will also be able to do these cauterizations with the edged cautery when you have craft and facility in the art. Be careful lest you go too deep with the cautery and burn the whole thickness of the skin and the abdomen and penetrate to the intestine, for the skin there is thin; bear this in mind.	0.74436706
