Chapter ninety-seven on the application of leeches.
Leeches are mostly used on organs where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either because they are too small, like the lip and gums, etc., or because the organ is devoid of flesh, like the finger and nose, etc.
The method of using them is to select leeches that are in fresh, pure water, free from putrefaction, then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they become hungry and nothing remains in their bellies, then the body is first evacuated by phlebotomy or cupping, then the affected organ is rubbed until it becomes red, then the leeches are placed on it, and when they are full, they fall off.
And if it is possible to suck the place with a cupping glass, it is more effective in benefit, otherwise wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the leeches fall off and it is oozing, then soak a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top until the oozing stops.
If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle powdered alum or gallnut or similar astringents on it until the bleeding stops, or place peeled halves of green beans on the area and leave them until the beans stick to the area, then the bleeding will stop.
And it is advisable, if there is a need to reapply leeches, not to use the same leeches if others are available. If the leeches refuse to attach, then wipe the area with fresh blood, or prick the area with a needle until some blood comes out, then place them; for if they sense some blood, they will stick to the spot. If you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them some aloe, salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.
