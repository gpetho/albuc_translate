Of the fracture of the ribs
Know that rib fractures occur only in the thick parts near the back, and at the ends inside, and they only bend because they are flexible; and it can be easily felt by probing with fingers.
And the restoration is that you set the fracture evenly, as necessary. Then apply the poultice, and bind it with a splint, if needed.
And if the rib fracture is inclined inward, the patient feels great pain and sharpness, like pleurisy, because the bone pierces the tissue; and breathes with difficulty, and coughs and vomits a large amount of blood, and this is very serious, and the ancients devised great ingenuity for it.
And there are some who say that it is necessary to administer foods that swell the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, lest hot abscesses occur, if they have not already occurred.
And if it has occurred, treat it.
And some of them say to apply cups to the spot, to draw out forcefully, and this seems reasonable; however, there is a concern that the cups might draw impurities to the spot due to weakness.
And some of them say to cover the spot with wool soaked in hot oil, and place tents between the ribs to even the bandage around, then treat as pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot endure because the bone pierces the tissue, and there is a concern for the patient, then cut above the broken rib, and place an instrument underneath to protect the surface; and then the bone should be cut, and removed carefully, and then sew the two lips of the wound if it is large, and treat with poultices, until it is healed. And if a hot abscess occurs, place cloths soaked in rose oil on the spot, and treat the spot as necessary for abscess, and the patient should lie often on the side where he should, until it is healed.
