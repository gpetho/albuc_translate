of childbirth/delivery
It is necessary first for the midwife that she recognize the appearance of a natural birth, and the signs are when you see the woman pushing downwards, and desires to smell things: then the child hastens to come out; then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and the exit is beneath its head, and the afterbirth with it; and when you see these signs, you must press gently on her belly, so that the child comes out quickly; for when it descends head first, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb/uterus is cleared of its excess fluids by a good cleansing; and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes feet first, and the body or the head and the hands come out, or it comes on its stomach, or often, and is perhaps turned on its neck, and in other bad positions; so it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skilled in these things, and to beware of error and deception, and I will show you all the positions and how one should assist them.
If the child comes head first by natural delivery, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, have her sit on a birthing stool, where the women hold her; and revive her nature with oil or cooked fenugreek, and then the midwife places between her fingers the small spatula of which here is the shape:
and tear the afterbirth/amniotic sac, and cut with her fingernail so that the liquid which is inside runs out; and press the woman's belly so that the child descends, and if it does not descend, then give the woman an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil; then make her grab and sneeze from hellebore, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: the child will come out immediately.
And if the two hands come out, you must gently push them back in little by little; and if they cannot go back in, put the woman on a seat, and lift her feet up high; then push the seat down to the ground, and someone hold the woman so that she doesn't fall when it is pushed down; and if the hands cannot be put back in, and the child is dead, then cut the hands with the knife which is shown earlier, and extract the child, and replace everything as it was.
of the delivery of the child feet first
When the child comes feet first, you must push it up; and then turn it little by little, until it is positioned correctly; then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it jumps/moves up to the thighs, tell her to hold on, and make her sneeze with hellebore; then it jumps/moves out, God willing.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is in its natural position.
For then it comes out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, take mucilage of marshmallow, and sesame oil, and melted gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and put this ointment on the woman's genitals inside and outside, then make her sit in lukewarm water up to below the ribs; and when she is softened below, make a pessary of myrrh, and put it inside her, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and hold her mouth and nose, and press her belly gently, for the child will come out immediately. 
of the child's exit onto her knees
When the child comes in this way, the midwife should put her hands there little by little; then she should be supported by her neck, with her feet hanging down, and lying on a bed; and fold her hands little by little, and then take her hands on her belly, and remove the cushions from under her, so that she is positioned downwards; and if the child does not come out, take her feet and move them strongly, then move her belly upwards, then put your hands there; and pull the child little by little; and tell the woman to push until the child comes out.
of the delivery of the child who comes out sideways with one hand hanging out
It is necessary to devise a way to bring back the hand: if it cannot be brought back, make the woman get up and walk; if she cannot walk, make her lie on a bed, and stretch her legs strongly; then administer the mucilage that I have described; and if she does not give birth, make her sit on a seat, then work on bringing back the hand; and pull the child according to its natural position, and make her sneeze, and tell her to push until the child comes out.
of the delivery of the child on its neck, with its hands spread out, and its face turned towards its mother's back
The midwife must hold her hand, then turn it little by little, and pull it gently; and when it is aligned, apply the mucilage of marshmallow and oil as we have said, then tell her to move little by little; and when you have done this, make her sit on a seat, and tell her to push; and make her sneeze.
in this same manner with the entire afterbirth
When the afterbirth comes out in this way, cut the afterbirth with your fingernail, until the moisture is drained; and if the child is hanging by its face and neck, cut it from the abdomen so that it is not retained, and the child dies; then push the child inside, until you have placed it as it should be, and tell the woman to push a few times: then it will come out easily.
of the delivery of twins
Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, and happens rarely.
Two is a strange thing, and they do not often live; I know this, that they are multiplied, and are separated by the membrane that divides them, which is attached to the abdomen; and sometimes they come out as naturally as one whole, as we have said.
And if they come out with difficulty, treat them as we have said, and let the midwife be skillful, and do quickly and lightly what she does; and do as is best for their safe delivery.
of multiple children
Sometimes one or two or three or four or five or six or seven, or more up to fifteen, are formed in the womb, all formed in the shape of a child by the measure of the glorious sage, and the midwife must know all this, because perhaps such a thing will happen to her; let her do according to what is necessary.
