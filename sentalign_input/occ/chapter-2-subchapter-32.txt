Chapter Thirty-Two
On the treatment of teeth that are prominent over the others.
When teeth are prominent not according to their natural alignment, this affects their appearance, especially when it happens to women, particularly venerable young girls; then you must consider: if a tooth is born next to another tooth and cannot be moved or aligned, then remove that one; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you incise it with this instrument, the shape of which is this; and it resembles a pigâ€™s snout, and should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp end.
And your incision, with which you cut it, should be over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and ensure that no other teeth are disturbed.
And if it is a prominent tooth exposed to filing, then file it with an Indian iron file, the shape of which is this:
And it should be entirely of Indian iron and easy to handle; and it should have many small points like a file used to make needles, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other teeth are disturbed and loosened.
And then smooth it at the end and scrape it with some scrapers.
And if it is a tooth, part of which is broken and injures the tongue, then you must file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and it should be evened out so that it does not injure the tongue or disrupt speech.
